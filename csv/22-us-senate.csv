This administration has had a rougher go of it because of the choice to distance itself from establishment institutional knowledge from previous Republican administrations. Economic decisions have been mostly positive except for the latest omnibus spending bill. On foreign policy, the administration has taken stronger approach towards foreign actors who do not share American national interests, so far that policy pivot has worked well with North Korea and China.","I support the tax cuts. To date, more American have seen an increase in their take home income which has allowed them to become more active consumers in the marketplace. The 1st quarter 2018 GDP growth is projected between 2.5 and 2.8% which is moving in a healthy direction.","I believe we should put in place a balanced budget amendment which will begin to reduce the deficit. Decades of spending more than we take in has led increasing budget deficits which has accumulated in a national debt of $20.85 trillion. While it is nominal for a nation state to have a debt, we must be prudent with our ratio of spending to revenue, so our economy keeps growing while keeping our financial sovereignty secure.","I do not think it is within the government's purview to redistribute resources to make everyone equal. Instead, government should make sure people have the equality of opportunity by reducing regulations and the allowing individuals to succeed rather than through programs which provide subsistence. I am in favor of entitlement reform. While there is a need for a safety net, too many people have accepted living on government assistance as a lifestyle, not as a limited helping hand. I do not believe the phrase ""promote the general welfare"" means the government should subsidize individual personal expenses through domestic discretionary funding. To me, this leads to subsistence and dependence.","No. I believe the 2nd Amendment is a crucial freedom for citizens to retain a Republic. First and foremost, owning a weapon allows law abiding citizens to protect their property. There are too many laws restricting law abiding citizens from owning weapons. Criminals can get the guns they want no matter what laws are on the books.","The Affordable Care Act should be abolished. The national government does not have the authority to mandate health insurance. The 9th and 10th amendments to the Constitution leaves that responsibilities to the states. If states want to provide that service to their citizens, I am fine with that decision on a state by state case.","Providing opportunities for economic growth through expansion of enterprise zones. More funding to small and minority owned businesses. A common sense housing policy which rewards home ownership and community development. A community development project which would rehabilitate older housing stack and tear down structurally unsound and abandoned houses. Getting out of the business of mandating school curricula standards such as Common Core, Race To The Top and No Child Left Behind.","Congress should provide resources to the states to develop substance abuse programs. The Congress, through its control over trade, should tighten international shipping requirements of opioids coming from China and across the Mexican border.","Sanctuary Cities – I am against Sanctuary Cites. I think they are unconstitutional because cities do not have sovereignty; only the 50 states and the national government has that authority. In addition, not only do these cities have increased crime and gang activity, they also economically hurt the most vulnerable of our citizens – low skilled and inadequately educated people living in urban areas. There should not be a pathway to Citizenship. A possible solution may be a work / residency status which would be subject to taxation.",I want our country to put together bi-lateral fair-trade deals. Countries who do not respect our political will are the ones who take advantage of free trade policies.,Iran is a rogue actor and should be treated as a threat to American interests regionally in the Middle East and around the world. Every tool should be considered to make sure the Iran regime follows through on its promises.,"North Korea is also a rogue actor and has shown itself to not care about diplomacy and nice talk. North Korea understands force and the threat of action. In the case of North Korea, it is best to mean what you say and be prepared to back it up. Showing resolve and strength is a vehicle to earn respect. North Korea has been bullying its Asian neighbors for decades; North Korea now sees a President who is not afraid to confront bullies.",How do you assess the Trump administration so far?,Do you support or oppose the federal tax cuts passed in 2017?

,YES,us-senate,Ben Cardin,Cardin,10/05/1943,Baltimore,Democratic,Baltimore County,http://www.bencardin.com,bencardin,BenCardinforMD,http://surveygizmoresponseuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/fileuploads/296249/4299807/253-de39e3f0bfe50ec3c6f51302f93fc6ca_headshot_close_2018.jpg,Graduated University of Maryland School of Law (1st in his class) Earned BA degree from the University of Pittsburgh (cum laude) Graduated Baltimore City College High School,"A lifelong Marylander, Senator Cardin serves as Ranking Member of the Senate Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee. He is a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and also is a member of the Environment & Public Works and Finance committees. From 1987-2006, Ben Cardin represented Maryland's Third Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives, including 17 years on the Ways & Means Committee. He was a member of the Maryland House of Delegates from 1967-1986. During his time as Speaker from 1979-1986, he reformed Maryland's property tax system, the school financing formula and the ethical standards for elected officials. After receiving his law degree, he actively practiced law until elected to the U.S. House of Representatives.","Donald Trump has shown over and over again that he doesn't have the temperament to be president or act ""presidential."" He doesn't have an understanding of how important his words are. He doesn't listen to advice and he has little aptitude for strategy unless it benefits himself personally. He continuously puts his own self-interest before the needs and national security of our country. He has repeatedly, intentionally misrepresented facts and events. His decision on day one not to transfer his business assets into a blind trust violated a fundamental protection in the constitution.","Oppose. This tax bill is not good for our economy and is bad for middle-income families. Former self-proclaimed deficit hawks allowed this immense amount of debt to be added to our nation's economy, meaning our grandchildren will be paying the interest on the interest for what was borrowed to pay for this permanent tax cut for corporations. At its heart, this bill was targeted toward large corporations and wealthier individuals. The provisions aimed at small businesses and working families were, by comparison, small and temporary. I am concerned that this bill will only widen the gap between wealthy Americans and middle- or low-income Americans. This tax law also is an attack on states like Maryland. Many Marylanders will come out much worse under this bill. In addition, the cap on the deductibility of state and local taxes is going to make it more challenging for state and local governments to meet their needs, the primary functions of which are to keep our communities safe and educate our children.","Yes, it is a grave concern. For example, in their recent tax bill, the Republicans added over $1 trillion to our national debt. This cannot continue. It will not grow our economy. Debt reduction cannot be a one-sided equation. We need to invest in places like infrastructure and education, which foster job creation and an educated workforce. While we need to prioritize spending, protecting programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid will be my priority. We cannot simply take a hatchet to programs. For example, improving the way we deliver health care (see answer to question 11) can slow down the rate of growth of mandatory health spending, helping us to reduce the deficit. The task of deficit reduction is not going to be easy, but we need a bipartisan commitment to control spending – both discretionary and mandatory – and have necessary revenues to control the deficit and, over time, balance the budget.","Yes. According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the rate of millionaires in this country grew five times as fast as the general U.S. population during the period of 1983-2016. There are now more than 9 million households with a net worth over $1 million. While it is positive that more families are succeeding, it overlaps with data from the Pew Research Center and others that show middle-income families shrinking as they fall into lower income levels. America's middle class – middle income families – has always been at the heart of our economy. Congress must take concrete actions to address the growing issue of income inequality, ensuring that quality education, housing, and health care are available to all Americans. A family should be able to afford a college education for their children without going into debt. We must foster programs and investments that make it possible for anyone who wants to work to find the opportunities available with the wages and benefits that can support a family. We need to invest in skills training to match workers looking for jobs with employers struggling to fill millions of specific positions. There are still far too many hardworking Americans struggling paycheck to paycheck. We also need to help Americans better plan for retirement so that after years in the workforce, people can enjoy the fruits of their labor.","Yes. Gun safety laws work. The overwhelming majority of Americans support stronger gun laws, which includes responsible gun owners who care about the safety of their communities. The NRA should not control the outcome of this debate. I've listened to students across Maryland. They want to know they are safe in their schools and their neighborhoods. They are pleading with adults to act like adults and take action. We cannot wait for the cycle of violence to repeat again and again without making a change. At a minimum, we must close the loopholes so that EVERY gun purchase includes a completed background check. We also must renew the assault weapons ban – there is no reason for such weapons of war to be in civilian hands. And we must block efforts to arm our teachers – the solution to the problem of daily gun violence and school shootings is not to bring more weapons into our schools. I agree with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that we must devote more resources to mental health priorities to identify young people (and adults) who may be about to cause harm to themselves or others. Let's attack this problem from multiple directions. Inaction is not an option.","Health care is a human right and universal coverage is essential. We should have seamless quality health care, affordable to all, from prenatal to death. The Affordable Care Act put us on a path toward this goal, however, Republicans have done everything possible to sabotage markets and the system since it became operational. The president's actions to weaken the individual market and cut support and outreach programs for the ACA has hastened some problems. Increasing the affordability of health care and improving our health system should not be a partisan fight. Congress should continue its work to stabilize health insurance markets to ensure that every American has full coverage. Having health insurance coverage is not enough. It must be affordable, accessible, and the quality of covered benefits, including consumer protections for patients, cannot be compromised. Accessibility is essential. Far too many people across Maryland are unable to access the full range of care they need because of where they live. Federally funded community health centers – 17 across Maryland – help fill the gaps in our provider networks by coordinating primary and preventive services that promote reductions in health disparities for low-income individuals, racial and ethnic minorities, rural communities and other underserved populations. I have also supported legislation that would expand telehealth services, which makes it easier for patients to connect with their health care providers and helps cut costs for patients and providers.","I was born and raised in Baltimore. This is my home and I will do everything in my power to help it grow and succeed. Similar to the boost created by the Obama Administration, there should be an ongoing all-of-government approach to helping Baltimore. Bolstering public safety and law enforcement, including robust federal support for the current consent decree with the Baltimore City Police Department, is important, but will only succeed in the long-run if paired with economic development and job training. The federal government also should provide tax credits and additional resources for infrastructure projects that support both commercial and residential growth. The federal government must be an unwavering partner in providing access to affordable, quality housing and health care, including mental health care and support for combatting opioid addiction. Congress has a responsibility to adequately fund the Every Student Succeeds Act, which helps ensure that City Schools and other urban school systems nationwide have the resources they need to provide students with career opportunities in STEM education, adequate mental health supports, and investments to support our neediest students. The federal government has a responsibility to continue investing in programs that help foster job creation, help small businesses compete and grow, while still protecting and supporting our children, our seniors, clean air and clean water. The federal government has an important role to play in promoting public health and public safety. This is as essential in our cities – including Baltimore – as in rural and suburban areas.","Maryland is not immune from the American drug epidemic, particularly the prescription opioid misuse and heroin addiction that has spread throughout every corner of our country. It is a public health crisis and must be addressed with every available resource at all levels of government. Tackling this challenge should go beyond efforts of law enforcement and must include sufficient funding to improve access to evidence-based treatment centers, promote prevention education methods, and provide support for those in or seeking recovery. We must keep our promise of federal funding for state-led treatment, prevention and law enforcement, education and outreach programs. We must work with medical professionals to limit prescriptions of opioids and encourage alternate methods of pain management. We need to invest in innovative programs that have worked in Maryland, including peer services for those in need of care. Congress came together to secure $10 billion to fight this crisis in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. The omnibus spending bill dedicated $3.3 billion in additional funding to address mental health services and coordinate efforts across agencies. I am hopeful this funding will provide resources to state and local governments to raise education and awareness, bolster treatment programs and facilities, and ensure that safe overdose countering drugs like Naloxone are readily available at all times. Congress also made headway reversing President Trump's proposed 27% cut to America's global counter-narcotics efforts, which would have weakened our ability to work with international partners to stem the illegal flow of drugs entering our country.","I believe the Senate should again take up bipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform to fix our broken immigration system. Congress must pass legislation to permanently protect Dreamers who are in this country and have mostly known no other country but this one. We also must take up and pass legislation I have introduced with Senators Van Hollen and Feinstein to create a legal pathway to residency for Temporary Protect Status (TPS) recipients, who also only seek a better life for themselves and their families, enriching our country and all that it stands for in the process. I was in the Senate in 2013 when we passed comprehensive bipartisan immigration reform. I believe it is possible again. We should not be wasting money on a fruitless wall, but we can strengthen technology and other border security. We can create a fair pathway to citizenship for those living in the shadows. For public safety, we must continue to effectively screen all who enter our country. We also must fight back against the Trump proposal to slash legal immigration, break up families and mostly close America's doors to refugees. Turning away legitimate asylum seekers at the border, and requiring mandatory detention of families and children, will do nothing to make America safer.","We are in a global economy and American producers, manufacturers and farmers can compete if given a level playing field. We must engage in international trade, but it must be done right. Our free trade agreements and policies should be focused on providing enforceable protections related to workers' rights, human rights, and the environment, and addressing serious imbalances, including through currency manipulation and anti-corruption measures. Our global economy has seen significant changes since, for example, NAFTA was first negotiated. We are facing new and different challenges that affect our businesses and our workers at home. Our domestic industries are facing different threats, including challenges from other countries related to market access and innovation. Our trade agreements and our approach to trade should reflect these changes.","I ultimately did not support the US-Iran deal three years ago because I felt that the JCPOA legitimized Iran's nuclear program, leaving Iran with the option after 10 to 15 years to produce enough enriched fuel for a nuclear weapon in a short time. However, since it was enacted, I have made clear that my priority is to ensure that America is good for its word and that the government has all the necessary tools to implement the agreement to its fullest. Particularly since President Trump took office, I have been one of the leading voices in the Senate to keep the US-Iran deal intact, provided Iran is in compliance. I have also worked directly with the White House national security team to explore solutions to keep us in the agreement. We don't want the United States to be the one who walks away from preventing Iran from becoming a nuclear weapon state. We would be isolated, and we'd give strength particularly to Russia and China. That makes no sense at all. What we should be doing is enforcing sanctions against Iran for its non-nuclear violations, its ballistic missile tests, its support of terrorism, its human rights violations. Unfortunately, President Trump has failed to implement the sanctions on Iran passed overwhelmingly by Congress last July and has chosen a path that makes addressing all other elements of a comprehensive Iran policy more difficult by alienating our allies and making it more difficult for them to work with the U.S.","The only workable solution to resolving the North Korean nuclear crisis is through diplomatic negotiations. The use of force would have catastrophic consequences. Last year, I called for a ""diplomatic surge"" with regards to North Korea. The opposite of diplomacy-by-tweet, it would provide an opportunity for collaboration with China and our Japanese and South Korean allies, leading to a place where Pyongyang could verifiably halt its nuclear and ballistic missile testing and we initiate negotiations toward denuclearization. By concentrating on denuclearization, and not regime change, diplomacy can succeed.",How do you assess the Trump administration so far?,Do you support or oppose the federal tax cuts passed in 2017?

I imagine however that it could do better by filling the leftover administration positions needed. Those positions are important in quantifying data throughout several interrelated spectrums across our economy. The President must assume that he can handle every office's overhead on his lonesome or leave it up to his twenty two administrative heads, impossible. Many of the holdovers in underlining positions under the twenty two are limited in their powers; nonetheless, the time they can be a holdover is limited. The Senate must confirm those individuals. Also; among their limitations, these inaction's are bound to cause turmoil. Because they're not confirmed, per se, their decisions can be challenged in court. Nevertheless the caseload is piling up. Voters are left to ask ""how much of importance is being overlooked?"" Whatever the politics be at play at that this point the American people are the ones to suffer the consequences of inaction. As far as doing fair may go, in my opinion alone, the American people must feel some sense of concern. Among the constant change-in/change-out of Trump appointees I believe voters must be feeling a bit of exhaustion. People want transparency and eligible dialog. I don't necessarily find a direct line of action, but more so the constant questioning of ""what's next"" is all the American people have at this point to ask. Voters don't want redirection or misdirection. They want a line of goals that are achievable and suit our future needs.","I do not support the TCJA entirely. We should bring back the AMT, raise the top tax bracket 3% and bring back the previous estate tax standard deduction with an exemption for farm properties. It's certain that the TCJA will add roughly $1.5T in additional debt over the next 10 years. It's a benefit for the overly wealthy and the middle class will face more debt due to the lack of federal assistance towards states, just like we're seeing in Maryland's trajectory. It's assumed that the government and our necessary democratic institutions can function solely through the breadth of added jobs. Even with a projected GDP average of 2.13% the economy would require nearer to 4.0% to offset the difference for the windfall the rich make out with. At that rate we would slide directly towards another boom-bust recession. Taking the brunt of the recession (07-09) and ongoing the middle class should be getting the benefit of the TCJA to pay down its personal debts, not borrowing more. If Congress cannot take a Keynesian model approach with the TCJA (nearly impossible to do) then our economy will lack several infrastructure needs. We're taking an austerity approach with the TCJA. However, if the overly wealthy became contractually obligated to fund important infrastructure needs, then Congress may very well find a remedy. I beg to differ. The Bush tax cuts lost 5 million jobs, most permanently; the TCJA will add just 339,000 permanent jobs. The TCJA is bad. End of story.","The level of our nation debt is a concern. What can be done to hinder its growth takes place in several parameters either by reducing discretionary spending, increase tax revenues, create efficiency in mandatory spending, hold back stimulus packages or a combination of some, addition, removal, or mixture of all. These by themselves, or in combination, would affect our need to borrow from foreign countries or increase bank allowances through the Federal Reserve. Increasing employment expands the breadth of taxable income. As such, economic growth spurs debt reduction. The federal government's spending goes hand in hand with GDP, acting as its own loner. It can spur growth with stimulus packages towards infrastructure or use private enterprise to create jobs. The hope is; that in a growing economy, wages will increase and people will pay off more personal debt, securing their own financial situation and, in return, affect the way government spends. Consumerism is the main driver of our economy, near to 70%. We may face a boomerang recession if we attempt Reaganomics without a progressive tax rate. We should set fair tax brackets and wages, close S & C corp. loopholes and focus on infrastructure spending. Our biggest frustration is what tax/spending policy fuels growth. Fiscal year 2027 predicts a budget surplus. We should focus on a Keynesian model now while the economy is in rebound. By the start of the next budget the wealthy will face a smaller tax burden with a booming economy stipend with a surplus.","Economic inequality has worsened just over the last few decades. With it involves several demographics--property value, job opportunity, business prospects, crime, wages--and none of them are always cut and dry explanations. Union Labor participation is down. Manufacturing and line work has shifted overseas. Illegal immigration increases over the decades have reduced opportunity and stagnated wages in trade work. Technology and automation has taken over. The federal government can take several steps to curb economic inequality: * legislate a minimum wage wealthy companies and corporations would fulfill * raise the standard deduction to $18k for single filers earning under $24k annually * legislate a standard deduction on overtime pay * keep small business taxes low & increase workplace incentives * compile entitlement programs into one Universal Basic Income * focus on reducing recidivism in the CJS & end for-profit state prison systems * legalize cannabis * decriminalize drugs * outlaw 'Pay-day loans' * outlaw 'Payroll check cashing' * increase grants and vouchers for summer camps or 'safe-space schools' (schools open during summer break) The best ability of the federal government to reduce economic inequality would be to start approaching systemic problems associated with economic inequality. The approach that can be taken is focusing on the predatory policies that mostly affect people of low economic strata. Nonetheless, Congress could start a special committee to directly oversee the best remedy for areas of low economic strata and implement an itinerary coupled with extra discretionary spending in the Housing and Urban Development bill.","Yes. Firearm violence reduction laws work. They're both proven in statistics and implementation. There's no need to enact another federal assault weapons ban, however, because the previous had no effect on firearm homicide rate. There was a decrease in mass shootings between 94-04, but correlation does not meet causation. Several ways to secure firearm safety and magnify firearm violence reduction is simple: * allow the ATF a centralized firearm database & implement a firearm licensing system -- this will reduce the prevalence of firearms used in street crime * require Federal Firearm Licensed dealers to vault & store their firearms -- this will reduce the prevalence of firearms used in street crime * enact mandatory minimum conviction periods on criminals in possession of an unlawful firearm -- this will reduce street violence * create a standard cool-off period on the purchase of all firearms -- this will reduce firearm suicide rates & 'passion crimes' * license and permit concealed carry holders without fallacious requirements * strengthen background checks w/licensing system * require person to person sales to follow background checks & licensing requirements * enact Red Flag legislation * raise high capacity magazine firearms and/or long rifle purchases to 21 w/exception to hunting or sporting permits","With respect to the Affordable Care Act we should amend the patient protection provisions and essential health benefits portions of it and couple it with a hybrid single payer & free market insurance system. The ACA provided a decent framework for an actual healthcare system; however, it was not a healthcare bill. It was insurance reform. Insurance coverage reform was needed, but the bill was over proportioned. A hybrid single payer & free market insurance system would require making CHIP & PACE permanently budgeted into our mandatory spending; allowing the Medicare trustees to negotiate drug prices; set the cost sharing reduction payments towards ambulatory care centers; and set federal co-payment threshold levels for working PCIP recipients that they would couple with their out of pocket insurance expenses. This system would be funded by keeping the 3.8% surtax on capital gains and dividends, and raising the FICA rate no more that 1%. With it allow insurance companies to compete across state lines and bundle insurance payments towards certain procedures and costs--which the CMS started testing under the ACA.","The role our federal government should play in any area similar to Baltimore is start acknowledging the wide array of proven obstacles and the time after time outplay of the systemic problems as they begin to arise. Situations in places like Baltimore didn't just arise recently. Many issues from gentrification all the way to various demographic changes can be well enough assessed and predicted from here on out. Remedy is often right around the corner. Places like Baltimore are ripe to spur development. That development can be started from basic roots within working class communities. More often than not, however, extra money in the pockets of residents can do more for poverty stricken areas than government. If a focus on Universal Basic Income can grow to fruition initially for poor households, The Dept. of Housing and Urban Development could widely improve the wealth of the working poor. 42% of the ""poor"" own their own home. The majority of the working poor don't necessarily lack basic amenities, they're not starving, and the majority don't lack some form of transportation. A UBI could be modified so that basic needs of poor households are covered yet, meanwhile, they're enabled to grow their own financial portfolio by investing in raising their property value. This spurs growth in several ways 1) small business; specifically trade work, benefits through employment; 2) neighboring property value rises; 3) crime reduces; 4) property value increases home buyers & increases property tax revenue; 5) local government efficiency is generated.",In order to address the opioid epidemic Congress could focus on legislation that would require a centralized pharmaceutical database in each state that would interconnect with all drug dispensaries. The implementation of a centralized prescription network could cause a dramatic reduction in inappropriately filled prescriptions for opioids. Congress could also enact legislation limiting the amount of opioids prescribed--in terms of quantity--over their intended duration or prescription refill/expiration date. Congress could also enact legislation that would require pharmaceutical companies to pay for and provide qualitative/quantitative drug tests to deter and identify drug abuse. A qualitative test tells you if a particular substance (analyte) is present in the specimen. A quantitative test tells you how much (the quantity) of an analyte is present.,"Congress should immediately grant amnesty to the 800,000 DACA-profile aliens. Also, it's possible to grant amnesty though a pathway to citizenship. In 2007 the CBO stated that ""in aggregate and over the long term, tax revenues of all types generated by immigrants - both legal and unauthorized - exceed the cost of the services they use."" It's absolutely possible that a long, drawn out arduous process can be accommodated with a pathway to citizenship if it was thoroughly implemented. As for other policies, the U.S. State Department has already set biometric data rules for visa/foreign workers. The U.S. needs better policies to deter and prevent unlawful stay over. Biometric reading devices should be required at the border and in airports to complement other systems already in place. Congress should also work to deter birth tourism by requiring sonograms for women on tourist or business visas (B-1 and B-2 visas in consular parlance). The effect of illegal immigration is wreaking havoc on our immigration policies by far, especially from illegal immigrants and unlawful visa overstays from Mexico and Latin America. Many will not comply with a pathway towards amnesty because they would not fit the requisite; not even if obtaining an ITIN helped to suit the goal. Many will just choose not to comply out of fear. But flying under the radar does them no justice as they will eventually wind up homeless and on the street.","The US should focus on strengthening NAFTA. This would curb several issues related to immigration and the manufacturing of goods with inexpensive labor. Nonetheless it would help stabilize Latin America's poverty problems. This would support our domestic industries and allow the US to rely less on Pacific trade partners. China, of all trade partners, manages to steal billions in intellectual property. The Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property estimates that stolen trade secrets, pirated software, and counterfeiting cost the United States between $225 billion and $600 billion per year. Our trade with Pacific partners, especially China, have grown stagnant and one sided. Nevertheless we are facing an ever growing militaristic threat as they build on atolls in the South China Sea. The US should lead the way of possibly removing China from the WTO if they continue flexing dominance over peaceful nations.",I support the Iran nuclear deal.,"As it stands North Korea may be looking forward towards negotiating a step-down denuclearization effort with the US. The US should seek a peaceful remedy with N. Korea, possibly opening the doors to a ""One Korea"" model to unfold. The US should continue its unrelenting pressure on Kim Jong-un to stop the goal of attaining an ICBM.",How do you assess the Trump administration so far?,Do you support or oppose the federal tax cuts passed in 2017?

Grigorian,Grigorian,11/17/1968,Bethesda,Republican,Montgomery County,http://www.grigorianforsenate.com,grigorianforsenate,grigoriansenate,,"Bachelor of Arts, History, The George Washington University (1990); Master of Arts, Education Policy (with honors), The George Washington University (1992); Juris Doctor, the University of Maryland School of Law (1996)",Lawyer,"To date, the Trump administration has undertaken certain initiatives that are good for Marylanders. Most importantly, this includes federal tax reform, which as put an extra $1700 in 73% of Marylanders' pockets. In addition, he has taken a hard look at our trade agreements and is working to ensure American companies are not disadvantaged globally when they attempt to enter foreign markets. Finally, the Trump administration has begun to ensure that American laws related to immigration are enforced; although solutions are necessary to address the 11 million people living in the United States illegally, we must be sure that our country, which is founded on the rule of law, is operated in accordance with the laws passed by the U.S. Congress..","I wholeheartedly support the federal tax cuts passed in 2017. For too long, American companies bore tax burdens that were significantly impacting their ability to expand and to provide important benefits to their workers, including healthcare and continuing education initiatives.","The debt service burden we are placing on generations to come is troubling. Congress needs to work harder and smarter to curb spending and make the necessary choices so that our children's futures are not mortgaged because our elected leaders failed to act on this issue. It is also important to note that, as the Fed raises interest rates, the amount of money Americans owe on our national debt also grows which will likely lead to a future drag on the U.S. economy.","Economic inequality is a problem and those of us who live in Maryland see it, know it and live it. Now is the time for us to understand as a nation that creating better jobs is the key to creating stronger families. Our elected leaders must look at the areas where growth in future technologies seems likely (including alternative forms of energy and transportation) and create economic initiative sectors so that all of those in Maryland benefit when the ""jobs of the future"" become the ""jobs of today.""","I am a supporter of the Second Amendment. I believe this country was founded on the idea that responsible citizens may keep a gun in their homes in order to protect themselves. I do believe, however, that our country needs to do a better job enforcing existing laws related to crime and guns. Additionally, I believe a stronger background check system should be implemented. With respect to ""red flags"" laws, I support those laws to the extent there are checks on the ability for people to recklessly assert that a potential gun owner should not have a gun in his/her possession and feel very strongly about the need to protect the due process rights of a defendant in such a proceeding.","At the outset, the ACA needs to be modified to allow health insurance plans to operate across state borders. It is anti-competitive and a disservice to Americans to prevent market forces from coming into play in this sector of the economy. Additionally, there need to be new laws that better attack the waste and fraud in the American healthcare system -- according to a Harvard Business Review study, if we were able to reduce ""administrative complexity"" and fraud in healthcare, Americans would save over 16% of the dollars we spend on healthcare. Initiatives to tackle these components of health care delivery in the United States should be undertaken quickly and efficiently.","A rising economic tide raises all ships. We need to use the economic momentum we have with a lower federal corporate tax rate and find ways for the government to boost job creation in Baltimore -- whether it is creating certain ""initiative zones"" where the federal government and the State of Maryland partner together to create economic opportunities (and jobs) in Baltimore or accessing more federal money for early childhood education programs in the city.","Congress needs to work with local communities to develop initiatives to combat this very real threat to Maryland families and children. Congress should also look at programs like Maryland's own ""Talbot Goes Purple,"" an initiative started by Sheriff Joe Gamble, to educate students on Maryland's Eastern Shore about the dangers of opioids, as a cost-effective model for educating America's school-aged children on the dangers posed by these drugs.","We are a nation of laws. As such, Congress must study and assess the needs of our country and determine the appropriate levels and types of immigration opportunities available to those who seek to come here (I should note that my father legally immigrated to this country in 1960 from Poland so I am well aware of the promise of the ""American dream"" for those given the gift of citizenship in this country). Once those laws are passed, they need to be enforced with all deliberate attention. Finally, i am in favor of legislation that would require local jurisdictions to turn over illegal criminals who have been convicted of felony crimes in this country to federal authorities for deportation.","I believe in mutually beneficial, negotiated trade partnerships like the Trans Pacific Partnership and NAFTA and support both of these initiatives.","Iran has shown that it is not interested in promoting peace and democracy amongst its people as the ""governed"" in that country have repeatedly protested their treatment at the hands of a repressive regime. Additionally, Iran has shown that it is willing to work against American interests in the Middle East, especially with respect to Syria. It is time to reassess the 2015 Nuclear Deal and determine how its continued implementation benefits the American people and American interests globally.","The current Korean threat is an unacceptable outcome resulting from years of neglect. It is time for our diplomats and leaders to enter into discussions that incentivize Kim to demilitarize the Korean peninsula. America must also more fully address the role China has played in allowing this imbalance to occur. And, as always, America's military muscle must stand at the ready if called upon to defend this country from Kim's threats and aggressive actions.",How do you assess the Trump administration so far?,Do you support or oppose the federal tax cuts passed in 2017?

I am old enough to recall the myriad political personalities who made lots of promises but provided excuses rather than results. America has been deprived of information by news outlets so individuals like myself really have to work at retrieving factual information as opposed to being fed propaganda from Russia and other sources. Jobs are up significantly for every income and ethnic group, personal and business income for everyone is up significantly, America has now become larger than Saudi Arabia in oil reserves and is challenging Russia as a natural gas supplier. There are other, unpublished, successes.",I support the tax cuts of 2017. Just as the Robert F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan tax cuts allowed businesses to blossom I believe these tax cuts will repeat history. Employees and businesses will definitely benefit but entrepreneurship will benefit the most. There is a reason what is in your wallet is called your money. Money is power. So the person who earned money should spend it.,"Congress and the Senate have neglected to produce an annual budget for years. A budget is the simplest yet the most important duty of federal elected officials. The failure to provide us, the citizens, the one's who authorize the government to exist, with a budget is embarrassing. Congress has been using the treasury of the U. S. A. to provide ""stuff"" to people essentially buying votes. The EGG Campaign I initiated may have a significant impact on the economy. New Congressman will not be indebted to others and could use normal thinking to produce a balanced budget.","The U. S. government requires permission from its citizens to do anything. Its what makes America unique among nations. The government should not be selecting ""winners"" like Solyndra. Economic rules, like lacrosse rules, should be known before the first whistle. They should not change at half-time nor should they change during a play. The government should encourage individuals to make a difference in the lives of others, their neighborhoods, and the businesses which surround them.","A change in gun laws is appropriate. Traditionally, gun laws have only affected law abiding citizens and are written that way. Most gun laws target the law abiding population but ignore criminals. Current law lists penalties for all manner of gun law violations but the reality is that the first charge to be dropped is the gun charge. Additionally, the 5 year penalty for possessing an illegal gun is seldom meted out. Filling out a NICS form with an untruth is unprosecuted. Guns protect cops, guns protect security guards, guns protect soldiers, and guns protect Presidents. Why not law abiding citizens?","When Maryland controlled healthcare if a problem arose an individual could call the Maryland Insurance Commissioner to attempt relief. If that didn't work you approached the Maryland Governor. If that didn't work you harangued your Delegate and State Senator. Just six people. With Obamacare, to make any changes, I must now engage 217 Congressmen and 60 Senators or get a Cabinet Secretary in Washington, DC to change something. Federal control of healthcare is too much. Alaska is not Maryland and one rule won't do.","Let citizens keep and spend their own money. The National government should encourage efficiencies in governance and refuse to permit illegal anything. Criminals who use the mail, Fed Ex, and Western Union to commit crime across state lines need to be caught. Export assistance is vital to established businesses and critical to startups and entrepreneurs. Lord knows there are enough existing plans, programs, loans and grants to boost Baltimore. Coaching or cheerleading is what is needed from the federal government.","Make sure doctors know that the problem exists. Educate suppliers enough that they can be part of the solution. Educate the citizenry so that they don't ""just say yes"" to an opioid prescription. Enforce existing law.","Borders are like front doors on a refrigerator. If just anyone can come into your house and open the refrigerator its probably not your house. America, until very recently, was one of the few countries where adherence to the law was of utmost importance. We cherished the law and followed it. I will need 59 other like minded individual Senators to change the law but ""legal"" needs to be returned to the conversation. Conversation is precisely what is needed. I have initiated the EGG Campaign - Everybody's Gotta Go so that I may work with a new set of Congressmen.","The government should not pick economic or industrial winners. However, if America is placed at a disadvantage our government should ensure the playing field and the same rules apply to all competitors. For instance, China steals patents. Its just what they do. It has to end.",No.,"Arrange for the North Koreans to deposit their nuclear warheads and their centrifuges with a cooperating nation, China, South Korea, Taiwan, or America. The North Koreans had signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty as well as treaties with the United States concerning the status of their nuclear programs. I would encourage Kim Jong Un to become one of the Fathers of a Unified Korea. It would end the Korean War, free 25 million serfs, eliminate nuclear security concerns but it would increase political tensions between adherents of democracy vs dictatorship.",How do you assess the Trump administration so far?,Do you support or oppose the federal tax cuts passed in 2017?

We have always been great. I think we need to put this country first and realize that when America does well, the rest of the world does too. I support his efforts on closing the trade gap with China. I believe in legal immigration and not giving rights to non-citizens, while the rights of Americans are being disregarded. An true assessment of his administration is virtually impossible, as they have a high turnover rate. I would not utilize social media in the manner that he does, but it doesn't seem to be hurting him in polling. Like it or not, I believe it gives us better insight into what the President is thinking.","I support the federal tax cuts, as I support any effort to reduce the amount of money that Americans pay to the IRS by either party. That is not just a Republican thing. The effects on the economy should be positive. The more money people have, the more they will spend. Increased consumer spending means that more jobs will be needed to meet the demand.","I am a budget hawk. Government spending is out of control and the borrowing has to stop. I believe the economic success of an administration should be based on how much they reduce the debt, while keeping consumer confidence high. With Republicans controlling the House, the Senate, and the White House, I am very surprised to see the estimated growth of the debt under the President's budget. I will support any effort to reduce the overall size of the federal government. I will introduce legislation to limit the scope of federal intrusion on state regulation by not specifying where states should spend the appropriations made to them by Congress.","It is very much a problem. I believe inequality impacts much more that just economic factors. The economy is a good way to begin to address it, but working on closing the gap across the entire spectrum of equality and fairness is the only thing that will work. In the inner city, the inequalities that are demonstrated by the judicial system leads to economic inequalities in that the over-policing of citizens, as has been demonstrated in several USDOJ investigations into the constitutional patterns and practices of local police departments, has caused the arrest of many people who were abiding by the law. The mere fact that an arrest is reported on an applicant's job application or resume is typically a disqualifier from someone being able to obtain a job. Some of those law abiding people lost their jobs. The government's responsibility in this aspect is huge and we must do better at making determinations that affect how they are able to live. As for the economic challenges we face, we need to attract more opportunity from the private sector in the inner cities. We must improve the education that is provided in our public schools, rather than promote charter schools, if their model is best, we copy that. Our children deserve the best possible education that we can give them. This will lead to them getting better jobs. We need to build the infrastructure that allows us to attract the opportunities to locate their interests in our communities.","I am a constitutionalist, so I believe that any restriction on our rights must be handled according to the rules that apply to convening a constitutional convention.","In Maryland, the number 1 driver our economy is healthcare. I have a problem with that. Maryland is the single largest payer of medical bills in the state. We should use that leverage to negotiate better rates from providers and improve our state hospital network to provide competition that raises the level of care provided by private hospitals while lowering costs.","As I mentioned, the federal government is too entangled in state government to do any good and needs to get out of the way. Maryland Democrats have taken away the rights of citizens to approach the grand jury in Baltimore City and request a criminal investigation into allegations of corruption charged against public officials. This shields the leadership from any prosecution and the State's Attorney refuses to exercise the discretion required to charge them. This is when the US Attorney's Office should step in, assess the allegations for evidence of federal crimes, and submit them to a federal grand jury. Applying the fair and equal justice system that we promote will help foster trust and better working relationship with the federal government, rather than contempt for it.","Aggressively prosecute the professional drug trade, as well as we do the illegal trade of it. In the meantime, Congress needs to provide a fix and that fix is treatment rather than incarceration for those affected by drug addiction. This support should also extend to the family of those addicted to opioid prescription medications due to the government's failure to act to stem the tide that this immense public health emergency has become. I support tougher sentences for those convicted of drug dealing and for those convicted of dealing in opioids should receive the death penalty if a death can be tied to their illegal operation.","I believe that the current objective of removing people who entered the US illegally is appropriate. I support a path to legal citizenship for those brought here by illegals, such as the situation that exists with the ""Dreamers."" Congress must observe the constitution when drafting laws and the Supreme Court must abide by it when those laws are challenged. The laws must make protecting American citizens a priority and permitting illegal behavior to occur is a direct threat to the public safety. Providing for the national defense requires having strong borders.",I support the renegotiating of all trade deals. NAFTA has been completely disastrous for American workers and it should be torn up immediately. America First!,Nope!,"Like Reagan handled the Soviet Union and ensure them that any aggression towards America will be met with exactly what President Trump described, as fire and fury the likes of which the world has never seen before. We can longer submit to the regime's attempts to draw us into conflict. I am against providing economic assistance to North Korea and any humanitarian relief for them should be accomplished by a coalition of countries that have an interest in having peaceful relations with the current regime. The North Korean leader must be held accountable for the murder of Otto Warmbier. Until that time, I cannot support any effort of the federal government to mitigate for North Korea's dismal record of disregarding the rights of their people that was given to them by God, and not the Supreme Leader of the rogue nation.",How do you assess the Trump administration so far?,Do you support or oppose the federal tax cuts passed in 2017?

,YES,us-senate,"Richard ""Rikki"" Vaughn",Vaughn,01/28/1980,Baltimore,Democratic,Baltimore County,http://www.rikkivaughn.com,,,http://surveygizmoresponseuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/fileuploads/296249/4299807/179-21af3c6d8c3b9e22a68e4327a9c340ad_Rikki_Vaughn_US_Senate_Headshot.jpg,BS- Hampton University magna cum laude MBA- University of the Southwest,CEO and business owner,"The Trump administration has had dangerous implications on our nation. In addition to ignoring the support for our society's most vulnerable residents in housing, immigration, small business development, transportation/infrastructure, education, higher education, and the environment his foreign policies have a negative impact on US farming and agriculture. In the end, his existence as Commander-in-chief undermines our credibility as a leader in the world and our democracy.","Federal tax cuts of 2017 were drastic. A cut from 35% to 21% was too steep of a cut for both corporations and government to unknowing implications. There was a consensus that federal corporate tax cuts were needed to compete with nations who had lower tax rates that were luring US businesses away. However, a tax cut of this magnitude was too risky for a leader of the US to make. It would have been a more responsible decision to wean in the tax cuts over time to reduce risk and uncertainty to American corporations and the US government. If US corporations don't return from overseas in droves in year one of the tax cut our economy could take a major hit.","The national debt is a major concern for the security of the US economy and for all future generations for our nation. There are several things we can do reduce our debt. The first thing we can do is do away with laws that restrict growth of US industry. The cannabis industry, for example, could produce billions of federal dollars if it is allowed to not be listed as a Schedule 1 substance. Two, after receiving billions more in tax revenue from cannabis sales the US government could spend the same amount of dollars on fixed expenses in healthcare and the military while having more dollars to reduce the debt.","Economic inequality is one of the principal factors that keeps the US from excelling and fulfilling its promise of being one nation for ALL. The federal government has a role to support local programs in neighborhoods that are working while also creating opportunities for groups to compete for grants to fund projects that will change lives. One example is education. Educational inequality is a major hurdle. The US government can give extra funding to programs that produce strong outcomes to expand them to quadruple outcomes. This can also be done in small business development, wealth management education, tech education, and higher education to use existing vehicles of education and higher education institutions to break the cycle of economic inequality by offering money from the US government to educate and train without requirement of cost on low income residents.","Federal laws on guns should be changed to allow more background checks on gun owners and gun purchases. I'd look for ways to license and register fire arms in similar ways as we license and register vehicles in the US. Through the license plate we know when vehicles are stolen and who owns the vehicle that may have fled the scene of an accident. Serial numbers of guns could be embedded within the gun to not be filed off if it is illegally sold. Also, a ban on the sales of automatic weapons and the equipment's, like bump stock, that can make weapons automatic is needed. In the end, laws that both prevent mass shootings and illegal gun sales to urban cities need to be passed as soon as possible to save lives.","The Affordable Care Act (ACA) was never a perfect piece of legislation, however, it doesn't need to be scrapped it needs to be strengthened. My belief is a single-payer ACA would be better for businesses and provide better services to tax-payers. A single-payer ACA would also ensure health insurance for all while providing more resources for local hospitals that are on the verge of closing because they're receiving less revenue as a result of fewer people having health insurance. A single-payer ACA would give less pressure on businesses because they could spend less money on healthcare having an Employer Single-Payer ACA that could be almost a Gold Card health insurance that could have employers spend less money on health insurance and employees would get a premium network of medical care paid for by businesses and the ACA. How do we pay for this? Billions received from tax revenue received from cannabis sales could help these costs.","Cities like Baltimore need support from the federal government in a myriad of ways. Financial support in existing areas of need in healthcare, economic development, housing, education, and higher education are all important. But, the federal government also needs the vision to funding to organizations that can produce the best outcomes via requests for proposals (RFP's) that would yield strong results. For instance, the federal government could provide funding for low income residents in Baltimore to attend college tuition-free while also providing these colleges with funding to partner with corporations and high schools to provide education and job training to the next generation of leaders in Baltimore. In addition, the federal government could provide leadership in creating corporate/government partnerships to merge high school to college training and education to increase high school graduation rates and employment rates simultaneously. For criminal justice, the best crime prevention tool is a job. With a smart and realistic job readiness and education/higher education support plan, Baltimore residents will have the tools needed to compete in today's global economy.","Cannabis has been proven to be a tool used to prevent the continued use and spread of opioid addictions nationwide. In states that have cannabis available for recreational use there are low levels of opioid deaths. Cannabis could be used as both a treatment for opioid users and a non-lethal replacement for residents who choose to responsibly inebriate themselves. Laws on the books similar to alcohol consumption should be available for those who impair themselves while driving vehicles, etc. However, reducing cannabis off the list of being a Schedule 1 substance could result in a national drop in opioid addition cases. In addition to cannabis, I'll push to have funding to provide all law enforcement personnel to be trained and carry naloxone kits to prevent opioid deaths. With the combination of preventative and action-orientated methods we can address the opioid epidemic in a smart and effective way to overcome it.","Immigration laws in the US should be changed to: 1 allow children of immigrants who were born outside of the US, but raised in the US (Dreamers) should be allowed to stay in the US; 2 misdemeanors and small crimes by immigrants should not warrant deportation; 3 deportations should apply to those who commit violent crimes in the US and will be subject to imprisonments and punishments US courts would agree with; the notion of ending ""chain migration"" needs to be fought – we need to support law abiding immigrants who may need to sponsor their mothers, sisters, and cousins to help their family in the US; 4 open doors to asylum seekers – nations like Haiti, Cuba, and Honduras have histories of human rights abuses, poverty, and war in their nations, respectively. Asylum in the US is just and appropriate in those situations. 5 Change in US immigration policy based on fears of the changing demography of our nation is no way to run a nation. The current changes the GOP supports breaks up families, results in millions of dollars of lost revenue, and is not what leaders of a nation deemed ""the land of the free"" should do. There's room in the US for our Dreamers, those who overstay their F1 Visa's, and their families.","There is consensus on the left and right that unfair trade practices should not be tolerated. However, instead of working to undermine a foreign nation to get better trade deals, negotiations to reduce global tariffs on US products and services be a better approach. For instance, the current climate of US/China relations is resulting in a trade war costing millions of reduced value on American companies in a wide variety of sectors. A global consensus of unfair trade could have resulted in other nations joining with the US in this trade war that would add more pressure on China to allow more international banking and tech institutions access the China. A global approach would have resulted in better trade to China with not only the US, but also with partnered nations which could've resulted in better US trade with those partnered nations as well.","The Iran nuclear deal was constructed to end the threat of Iran obtaining nuclear weapons. There has been little evidence showing Iran is on the verge of attaining a nuclear weapon and so far the deal appears to be a success. When the deal was struck, sanctions were lifted from the European Union (EU) and other nations resulting in Iran receiving billions, having a stable economy again, and giving no reason for Iran to renege on the deal. I support the Obama lead Iran deal with one caveat, that Iran ends its proxy wars against our US allies in the region like Israel and Saudi Arabia. Conflicts in the region has resulted in thousands of people being killed from Syria to Yemen. I would support getting rid of the nuclear deal in favor of a more harsh deal on Iran if it continues with these proxy wars against our allies in the region.","Stronger sanctions and global pressure with allies against North Korea has forced North Korea to be more conciliatory towards South Korea and more willing to have a peaceful dialogue with the US. Continued pressure on North Korea to stay on the course to de-nuclearize while promising to lift sanctions and offer agricultural and infrastructural upgrades to North Korea, through South Korea, could all be on the table to push North Korea to give up their nuclear ambitions.",How do you assess the Trump administration so far?,Do you support or oppose the federal tax cuts passed in 2017?
