I also believe in ensuring the perimeters of our schools and classrooms are as safe as possible (locked doors, intercom system). I do not believe in metal detectors, student pat-downs and clear back packs. 1. Metal detectors: who would ""man"" the detectors? Does this mean hiring more staff? What happens if it goes off? What about all of the false positive alarms? 2. Clear backpacks and pat-downs: The last thing a teenager wants is for the world to see their personal belongings at school... I do not believe clear backpacks and pat downs would make students feel safer; rather, they would feel more exposed and violated. I believe the priority should be on ""safety from within"" and improving school culture: smaller class sizes, more wrap around mental health services, less standardized testing and more opportunities for student/teacher relationship building.","I believe redistricting is a band-aid solution to overcrowded schools and we need stronger APFO laws to address root cause. Temporary classrooms in trailers made out of metal have become permanent classroom spaces, the status quo. This simply isn't equitable, nor fair. The indoor air quality is sub-par and and they are vulnerable to safety threats. The Board of Education needs to be part of the school planning process from the beginning, with a more formal partnership with the Department of Planning and Zoning. It seems we are to rely on the input and statistics of just a few people and I would argue that the BOE should take a much more proactive and collaborative role. We need to explore alternative financing methods to generate funding for capital projects. By using a public private partnership (P3), we can leverage private investment with public funds for building design, construction, operation and maintenance. Moreover, given the shifting demographics, we need to plan for more flexible building prototypes, i.e. buildings that can be more than a school. This is why models like P3 are so important as we move forward.","I do not believe that increasing class size should ever be used as a way to balance the budget. For me, class size is a non-negotiable. There is still much room to streamline spending but unfortunately we do not have a strategic financial plan in place, with established performance measures and outcomes. Implementation of a strategic plan is one of my priorities. How can we plan for the future and prioritize if we don't know how things have worked in the past? Until we have funding, we need to explore community resources and partnerships as 3 social workers is not nearly enough. That being said, we currently have 3-4 people who work on a 900 million plus budget. I believe we need to redirect central office staffing to provide adequate resources to the departments that directly impact our fiscal stability (budget, procurement, accountability). I believe investing in positions that could ultimately save money that can be redirected to where its needed is a prudent use of resources.",I believe that one time funding from the county is more prudent than raising insurance rates. Teacher retention is paramount to the success of our students and school system. Raising health premiums along with our plan to increase class size may cause more teachers to leave the county.,"I believe in addressing root cause. If you take away students who qualify for free and reduced meals, test scores rise and suspension rates fall across all ethnicities. The effects of poverty on student achievement in Howard County is stunning. Since most students who qualify for FARMS are minorities, it is these groups who fall behind. We need to use data to target interventions and support more effectively and partner with the county to address the societal socioeconomic disparity that translates into opportunity and equity gaps at school. I believe priorities should be: - targeted preK opportunities -decreasing class size -less time behind a screen and more time engaging with teachers. -Schools with high FARMs rates should have social workers and therapists on staff, not ""floating"" between schools. -We must keep the effects of poverty in mind as we draw boundary lines to ensure that most of the need is not concentrated at just a few schools. -Mandatory cultural proficiency training for all teachers -Trauma informed care training targeted at schools who need the most support -More active recruiting of minority teachers and aggressive training and retention programs.","Absolutely the Board acted appropriately. Given what we now know about the financial mismanagement under the prior superintendent, I'd say this decision was a very wise investment and in the long run, saved us tens of millions of dollars. Unfunded programs, like Teachers for Tomorrow and the raiding of health and dental fund has caused the current financial crisis. As it stands, we will continue to pay for the lack of oversight of the former Superintendent for years to come.","I believe Dr. Martirano has changed the culture of the HCPSS from one of fear of retribution to one of communication and engagement. It is clear that he values public opinion, which is a drastic change from the prior Superintendent; however, I do believe that caring too much about public opinion can become a handicap when it comes to unpopular decisions-- for example, with redistricting. I also believe that the Board has been excluded (and therefore the community) from some important decisions, for example, the decision to increase police foot patrols in schools. With the prior Superintendent, there was a very adversarial relationship with the County Executive and County Council. This was not productive, and it was the school community that suffered the ramifications. The climate is much improved now; however, it is important for the Superintendent to maintain very clear lines between his office and that of the County Executive and at times it seems these lines have been muddied. As I have stated before, we can more effectively streamline central office positions. Since 2016, there has been an increase of over 1.3 million dollars in central office salaries. 540K of that has gone towards 3 new community superintendent positions. Though I do not question the value of these positions, I would argue that this may not have been the right time and given our current fiscal crisis, the priority should have been decreasing costs.","With rising concern over school safety, should county police officers or sheriff's deputies be assigned to all public schools, along with additional screening methods, such as metal detectors, student pat-downs and clear backpacks?","Is the county school system's program to reduce crowded schools through redistricting an effective method given projected shifts in population growth, housing development plans?","Superintendent Michael Martirano has shifted budget priorities and is proposing to eliminate a world language program that's in place at eight (of 41) Howard County elementary schools and his budget might require increasing class sizes, by one student, in several middle and high schools.

Based on the results, each school needs to be provided the necessary resources to keep students and staff safe. I support the placement of Community Resource Officers in all high schools and middle schools as needed. Additional security measures need to be implemented according to schools' specific needs.","Given projected population growth , Howard County Public School System's program to reduce overcrowding through redistricting is an effective method. Another method to address overcrowding includes modifying the system's open enrollment policy to allow students the option to transfer from over crowed schools to schools with available seats. However, this method will not fully reduce the number of students in crowed schools.","Given the budget deficit and increasing student enrollment, Superintendent Martirano had to make very difficult decisions. Ensuring safe and nurturing schools is a top priority for the school system and community. I strongly advocate for increasing mental health resources to support students emotional well-being.","The school system's health fund was not fully funded for the operating budget for several years. The HCPSS should examine all possible ways to stabilize the health fund and provide employees with quality health plans. A task force should be created to bring together members of the community, county government, businesses, and non-profit organizations with school system staff and employee associations to study the problem and generate a short and long term plan to address employee health care.","As a former Assistant Superintendent, I coordinated the development of The Comprehensive Plan for Accelerated School Improvement (CPASI) as a district and school reform initiative designed to accelerate achievement for all students and provide intense focus and support for the schools with the largest student achievement gaps in the district. The CPASI aligned processes and priorities throughout the school system and established clear expectations for all schools. Organizationally, I created the Department of Student, Family, and Community Services to coordinate development and implementation of academic intervention and student services, design and implement a model for family and community outreach in all schools linked to school improvement efforts, and align and integrate delivery systems for student, family, and community support services. To provide schools with instructional resources, I coordinated the development of a K-12 Academic Intervention Plan designed to accelerate student learning. The intervention plan was adopted and funded by the Board of Education. Student achievement gaps were reduced. Within two years, all of the schools in-improvement exited school improvement status as defined by the Maryland State Department of Education. Successful reduction achievement gaps requires a willingness to examine instructional, organizational, professional development, and operational practices for inefficiencies and willingness to engage in honest and open discussion about how to improve them. It requires involvement of school-based staff, central office staff, and parents, families and the community. The key is that everyone accepts responsibility for eliminating the achievement gaps. I feel we need to reignite our commitment to accelerating student achievement.","In order to avoid protracted litigation, I think the school board acted appropriately. To respond to community concerns about the school system leadership, the school board needed to hire an interim superintendent to to begin to positively turnaround the school system.","I feel that Dr. Martirano has effectively responded to community needs and began to build trust with the school system parents, families, and school system staff. I support his reorganization in creating community superintendents who are responsible for a cluster of elementary, middle, and high schools.

I continued my education at the University of Maryland College Park where I graduated in 2016 with a Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering.","I work as a Construction Superintendent for a major commercial construction company coordinating work in the field, solving complex problems during construction, and managing budgetary constraints of our projects.

Security measures such as metal detectors, pat-downs, and clear backpacks provide false senses of security and pose the potential to increase student, educator, and community anxiety levels; I oppose the implementation of any and all measures that will contribute to a false sense of security and rob our schools of their positive learning atmosphere. School safety is priority #1 of our campaign. Mass shootings are a small portion of the many school safety concerns that face our students each day. HCPSS must work diligently to increase the number of mental health professionals in our schools to take a proactive approach to school safety by encouraging positive mental and emotional health amongst students and staff. Concurrently, it is important to note that we live in different times and may have to explore the expansion of armed security in our school facilities. Any expansion of armed security must be intimately familiar with real tensions between communities of color and the law enforcement community. Increased security should be administered through our School Resource Officer (SRO) program with the Howard County Police Department to ensure our most student-centered, culturally competent officers are those spending time in our schools. Arming educators is not a realistic or responsible option in our pursuit of increased security.","The Howard County Public School System is facing serious overcrowding especially in the eastern part of the County. Redistricting is one of a multitude of necessary initiatives required to reduce overcrowding. Like many members of the community I was disappointed that more significant redistricting was not undertaken by the Board of Education in 2017. Redistricting is a school safety issue - overcrowded schools are inherently unsafe and every effort to bring our schools to appropriate attendance levels in a timely manner will be important for the new Board. With the site for High School 13 now selected in Jessup the new Board of Education must initiate the process for redistricting that trends westward, utilizes the new anticipated High School 13 district, and prioritizes brick and mortar classrooms over portable classrooms. The School System and community need to develop a phased approach to redistricting that minimizes effects on current students, especially our high school students. Unfortunately, redistricting is a rather controversial topic; it is critical that we elect members of the Board of Education who are able to make difficult decisions. Members of the Board of Education must understand the importance of listening to community input while remaining true to their commitment to all 55,000+ students of the Howard County Public School System. Beyond redistricting, HCPSS needs to vigorously advocate for continued capital project needs. With proper planning as well as utilization of Howard County's newly updated Adequate Public Facilities Ordinance relief for overcrowding is on the horizon.","Creating an environment that encourages positive mental and emotional health for our students and educators is of utmost importance - I believe a well-balanced approach to school safety is incomplete without strong investments in social workers and support staff and believe this initiative is prudent. Research suggests that smaller class sizes help student comprehension and educator success. The School System is dealing with an operating deficit; I believe that every effort should be made to avoid cuts at the confluence of dollars and classrooms, including class size. Finally, all programming within HCPSS needs to be evaluated for its effectiveness to ensure that initiatives are having the desired effect in the classroom. The Board of Education must make all decisions based on data; world language is no exception. Research has shown that introducing students to foreign language education at a young age benefits them in many ways. While it is important to recognize that some students found great success in the program, HCPSS's implementation of the world language program was not helping our students as expected. The brief timeline within which our elementary world language program was introduced and promptly ended is regrettable; the program as a whole was not properly piloted and evaluated before its expansion to eight schools. This underscores the importance of program evaluation. In the future all system-wide initiatives must be research-based, piloted, and evaluated for their effectiveness so that innovation within the system can occur while providing a consistent education experience for students and staff.","The primary contributing factor to the large health and dental fund deficit is a failure by HCPSS to contribute a contractually obligated amount into the fund to cover costs. Starting over a decade ago, funds have been continually diverted from the health and dental fund to initiate other programming, a habit that continues to manifest itself in the larger overall operating budget deficit. A one-time contribution from the County will be necessary to close the fund deficit but HCPSS must first work to address the operating deficit to ensure that a further bailout is not necessary in the coming years. The Howard County Education Association understands the contractual obligations of both educators and their employer. Asking educators to pay higher insurance rates to cover the portion of the deficit caused by HCPSS's failure to honor its contractual obligations should not be considered. If increased healthcare costs are found to be associated with the fund deficit a proportional increase of health insurance rates would be fair and likely warranted pending negotiation.","Data shows that there is vast room for improvement in closing the achievement gap. To start, it is important to note that the achievement gap is simply a manifestation of an underlying opportunity gap. We must work to ensure that we provide opportunities to our students that give them the ability to succeed in light of their circumstances regardless of outside factors. This includes turning our focus to our most vulnerable youth at a young age to ensure they are keeping up with their peers. As a Senior in high school I aided in a tenth grade on-grade-level English class and witnessed first-hand vast injustice of our school system under-serving and ultimately failing many students, particularly students of color and students with disabilities. The enormous gap present between AP/GT courses and on-grade-level courses was shocking. Since that year, equity has been and will continue to be in the forefront of my mind. Ensuring equitable opportunity for all students will require HCPSS to engage communities that have been historically underserved by the education system, come to terms with those failures, and provide a concrete and earnest effort to presume competence and close the achievement gap. This will require better collection, analysis, and use of data. It will also require programmatic differences between our higher and lower achieving schools; members of the Board of Education must be fierce advocates for defending equity.","Maryland is one of the only, if not the only, state that does not grant local boards of education the authority to terminate their superintendents for cause. This law must be changed in Annapolis in order to ensure no county is placed in the position in which Howard County found itself in early 2017. Due to current law buying Dr. Foose out of her contract was the only option available. Reaching the agreement that led to Dr. Foose's resignation was absolutely necessary. The Howard County Public School System was in desperate need of more transparent, community-oriented leadership. Dr. Foose's departure triggered an immediate release in funding from the State government that was previously being held due to suspected financial mismanagement under Dr. Foose. Further, Dr. Foose's departure has allowed a more responsible Board of Education to address funding problems that were perpetuated under the previous administration. In order to ensure HCPSS has a strong future the new Board of Education must identify ways that our previous administration exploited policy to debase trust between the school system and the community and close loopholes in policy, codifying safeguards to avoid the mistakes of our past. The community must come together to move past what has happened and focus on our collective future. While remaining conscious of our past is important, focusing on the future with optimism and inclusivity needs to remain at the forefront of all activities of the Howard County Public School System.","Dr. Martirano inherited the most difficult job in the County and has handled himself well. He has been proactive in restoring community trust and confronting the realities of our past. He is student-centered and enjoys visiting our schools. He is a strong leader, but this trait is as much an asset as it is a trait that requires attention. I would like to see Dr. Martirano improve his communication with the Board of Education. During large decision making processes, specifically redistricting, Dr. Martirano has a tendency to take an executive-level course of action and propose plans to the public without proper consultation with the Board of Education. This creates more difficulty navigating complex issues as the Superintendent's proposals can leave the Board of Education to deal with difficult realities not addressed by preliminary plans released by the Superintendent. This emphasizes the importance of the check-and-balance relationship that is required between the Board of Education and the Superintendent. The restructuring of Central Office has shown some promise but concerns over high Central Office salaries persist and additional effort will be necessary to drive cultural change within Central Office. Dr. Martirano is off to an excellent start. With more clear communication of expectations between the Board of Education and the Superintendent I believe he will find great success in turning HCPSS into an even stronger institution of integrity. I look forward to the opportunity to work with him in the coming years.","With rising concern over school safety, should county police officers or sheriff's deputies be assigned to all public schools, along with additional screening methods, such as metal detectors, student pat-downs and clear backpacks?","Is the county school system's program to reduce crowded schools through redistricting an effective method given projected shifts in population growth, housing development plans?","Superintendent Michael Martirano has shifted budget priorities and is proposing to eliminate a world language program that's in place at eight (of 41) Howard County elementary schools and his budget might require increasing class sizes, by one student, in several middle and high schools.

We need to tighten the physical security of our school buildings with known workable, non-intrusive deterrents like locks, buzzers, open door sensors, classrooms that can lock from the inside, and conversion of our portables to brick and mortar secured facilities. At the same time, we need to avoid turning our schools into jails with metal detectors and student pat-downs. I believe HCPSS and Howard County Police need to ensure that there is a common understanding on the role of police officers in our schools. Our police provide critical security support to HCPSS – to include the existing School Resource Officers (SROs) – but we need to ensure that HCPSS provides a welcoming and supportive learning environment in which youthful misbehavior is not criminalized. Moreover, the cost of adding a police officer to over 60 additional schools is simply not the best use of tax payer dollars when we cannot even afford to buy new textbooks. Furthermore, some of the most effective dollars that we can spend to enhance school safety are in mental health and social-emotional programs. We can have the greatest impact on school safety when we build in mental health and community building into the curriculum and hire social workers to provide needed interventions as early as elementary school. We need to build our community up not lock it down with armed guards patrolling the hallways.","In order to reduce crowded schools, we will need a solution that includes both redistricting and the construction of new facilities. Given the existing growth rate of HCPSS, the existing facilities are simply not sufficient. You cannot add the equivalent of a new school worth of students every year without actually building facilities to house them. At the same time, we would not be good stewards of taxpayer dollars if we simply proposed new facilities while many of our existing facilities are below 90% capacity. In terms of redistricting or school assignment, it can either be done on a voluntary basis or through changes to attendance areas. Dr. Martirano and the Board attempted to leverage voluntary student movement under the Jump Start program of dual high school and college enrollment. This program, while having value as an educational initiative, looks to be insufficient to reduce overcrowding at the three targeted high schools and certainly does nothing to address over crowding at elementary and middle schools. Moreover, the additional transportation costs stress an already insufficient operating budget. The most equitable solution to solve overcrowding system-wide is to do a comprehensive phased-in redistricting. With the development of long-range plans that include accurate housing development and population projections; smart, sensible, effective plans can be drawn up with an eye towards an equitable education experience for all with optimized facilities usage. Sensible redistricting must be part of the solution.","These are unfortunate but likely necessary choices given the financial situation. At the same time, I believe we need to develop a comprehensive multi-year plan that will enable us to reverse some of the trends – in particular, a plan that will reverse the increase in class sizes. I don't believe any member of the Board or the Administration is comfortable with the class size increase – and it will take hard work by all of us to look at multi-year strategies to return class sizes back to where they need to be. As one who appreciates the importance of World Language instruction – especially in the early grades – I had hoped the pilot activity conducted by HCPSS would yield a model that could be expanded to all our schools. Unfortunately, one of the lessons learned was that such an expansion would have been cost prohibitive. The Board and Administration again made the difficult but correct decision to end this program. Additionally, it would be wonderful if we could add more than three social workers per year, but with the current budget crisis, it needs to be incremental. We need to target services for our most at-risk students and intervene with them to provide supports and services early in their education.","These are two distinct problems. One is addressing the past—with fixing the deficit and financial mismanagement of the health fund and the other addressing the future—with rising costs for health care. In terms of the budget deficit, the school system and the Board of Education will need to work with the County Executive, County Council, and local legislators to develop a multi-year financing plan to repay it. This problem was not created in one year and is unlikely to be solved in one year. As such, a long-term strategic operating budget needs to be developed. We must stop treating each year as a separate budget crisis, and instead develop a long-term plan similar to what we currently do with the capital budget. If we took the approach of developing a multi-year operations budget with consistent and competent financial modelling, then we could align our budget to our educational priorities rather than just putting out fires. In terms of addressing the future, we need to ensure that compensation – which includes healthcare – is competitive so that we can continue to attract and retain the high-quality teachers and staff that we currently do.","We need to begin by reversing the trend of increasing class sizes. This is one of the key ways that HCPSS historically has tried to give personalized, directed instruction that helps struggling learners. In the past four budget cycles, class sizes have been increased three times. The achievement gap will widen if we do nothing to protect smaller class sizes. As a Board of Education, we need to commit to continue to fully fund successful achievement gap reducing programs like the Black Student Achievement Program, Saturday Math Academy, Hispanic Liaisons, the International Parent Leadership Program, and more. As a school system, we also need to look at the overrepresentation of African Americans, boys, and special education students in suspensions and other discipline measures. We need to examine the structural hurdles to our students for athletics and activities where we currently have a policy that reduces student engagement. Once we identify the root causes, then we need to take active steps to fix bias in the system. We need to enact the 52 recommendations from the Committee for Diversity and Inclusion. We also need to hire a diverse work force that reflects the demographic diversity of the student body because all our students need role models and teachers that look like them and advocate for them.",Yes. I believe the Board and County Executive negotiated an agreement that in the end was best for the community.,"Dr. Martirano deserves high marks for his efforts to rebuild morale and community relationships. He has demonstrated a strong commitment to engaging with students, staff and families. His reorganization of the central office has been purposeful with an eye toward more effective administration.

Previously, I have been an adjunct professor at Howard Community College, and I have directed summer band camps though HCC and our Department of Recreation and Parks.",(410) 227-8445,miller4boe@gmail.com,http://www.miller4boe.org,Miller4BoE,RMiller4boe,http://surveygizmoresponseuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/fileuploads/296249/4299900/253-1e5e1ca4711bd6a1d513bfbf8e8d388a_Roberts_Campaign_Photo_copy.jpg,"No, because unfortunately it is doubtful that these types of practices would have prevented the tragedies that occurred. We should only add to our present security measures if we have proof that they are effective. We must differentiate between an appearance of security and actual security. As Tricia Bishop stated in her 3/1/18 column in the Baltimore Sun, ""If someone is bent on doing damage at a school, there are myriad ways to go about it even with the tightest of access procedures in place and an armed guard posted at the main entrance. When Adam Lanza ran into a locked door at Sandy Hook Elementary in 2012, he shot his way in through a window."" Preventative measures such as increasing police familiarity with HCPSS facilities would be worthwhile, as would increasing the number of school social workers, using restorative justice practices, and implementing some types of technology and equipment that have been found to be effective. We should use our funds judiciously, though; sadly, nothing can guarantee safety, and difficult choices must be made with limited funds. We should focus on keeping our students safe outside of school, too. Meanwhile, an examination of accurate relevant statistics would show that our schools are still relatively safe places. Our students should not have to attend school in a prison-like atmosphere. We all wish we could solve this problem, but there is no easy solution. We should focus our efforts on what has best been proven to work.","Given our present structure, redistricting is the most effective way to reduce crowded schools. There are other initiatives that could be helpful, such as dual-enrollment programs like JumpStart, career and technical education programs, and/or world language immersion magnet programs. Other types of ""magnet school"" arrangements could be options, but though they can look appealing on the surface, they can carry with them a number of liabilities, such as issues related to transportation, feeder schools, community stability, after-school activities, lotteries, overspecialization, etc. Furthermore, they can result in non-magnet schools becoming ""repel schools."" Redistricting can reduce crowded schools and, if done judiciously, could also help to equalize demographics and promote diversity while keeping feeder systems and communities reasonably intact. That said, in order to minimize disruption, we should enhance public awareness that the quality of a school, and the suitability of a school for an individual student, cannot and should not be determined by test scores, and that highly successful students graduate every year from every Howard County school. After 34 years of teaching in our school system, I have experienced several instances of redistricting, and I have found that for the great majority of students who are redistricted, after three weeks of school if they were offered the choice of going back or remaining, they would remain at their ""new"" school (though publicized options should exist for very special circumstances). Though redistricting can be challenging, it should remain our primary way of addressing overcrowding.","Eliminating the elementary school world language program as it was implemented was prudent. The program was poorly designed. Only one language, Spanish, was offered, and the program did not exist in 4/5 of our elementary schools. There was inadequate follow-through in middle and high schools due to the limited number of schools in which it existed, and the ability to expand the program was very much in doubt for financial and staffing reasons. Students with various numbers of years of experience from elementary school were put in 6th grade classes with beginners. Students who received 30 minutes of instruction 5 days a week from K-5 and then took Spanish in middle school could still only start 9th grade in Level 2, along with students who started in 6th or 7th grade. Students who moved into these elementary schools faced obvious challenges upon entering this program. We should be considering better options for implementing elementary school world language. The increase in class size is very troubling, but possibly prudent considering our budget challenges; hopefully the county can provide funds to prevent this from occurring. Adding social workers was prudent, as the expenditure would barely make a dent in class size this year, but would add to a program that could help improve student safety as well as educational outcomes. Thus, given today's (4/11/18) big budget picture, overall Dr. Martirano made reasonably prudent decisions, though I hope that an increase in class size won't be needed.","It is important to differentiate the deficit issue from the health care issue. The deficit was primarily caused by insufficient funding of the health care fund by previous school system leadership; money that should have gone into the fund was used instead for other initiatives in the operating budget. The present challenge is restoring the fund to where it should have been if it was responsibly funded, and I do not believe that our educators should be asked to bear this unfortunate burden any more than other taxpayers. That said, the annual increase of our educators' health care claims averages about 3%; not much more than the increase in cost of living. Continued efforts to contain costs and elicit savings should continue to keep these costs manageable. Furthermore, our educators' health care plans are similar to those in other local jurisdictions, and it is important that we remain competitive in what we offer, especially given the challenges of finding highly-qualified educators in the present environment. Therefore, though it is distressing that this situation was permitted to occur, I believe this solution should involve a two-pronged approach. First, our county government should use available funds to help reduce the deficit, in combination with our school system prioritizing funds for use toward the elimination of the deficit. Second, the health and dental fund should be maintained in a responsible way, enabling educators' health care plans to continue to be competitive with those of other local jurisdictions.","Though some good attempts have been made, overall HCPSS's efforts have been insufficient. Some examples of more that can be done would be to: -Provide more staffing, equipment, etc., when needed at schools with student populations that face extra challenges -Prioritize one-on-one assistance for students struggling with basic skills; refusing to accept non-mastery -Reduce the time teachers spend dealing with standardized tests and educational fads, poorly designed and inefficient teacher and administrator evaluation systems, and paperwork and procedures, thus enabling increased teaching and learning time, including time for on-on-one assistance -Prioritize hierarchical skill mastery over information attainment when necessary to provide one-on-one assistance -Provide opportunities for enrichment by making available scholarships, funded by community organizations, foundation grants, individuals, businesses, and HCPSS, to be used for enrichment, tutoring, etc. -Enable volunteer, service, and internship opportunities for high school students to provide enrichment, tutoring, etc., to younger or less experienced students -Ensure to the extent possible that basic needs (food, shelter, clothing) are met and wrap-around services exist for students who need them -Ensure to the extent possible that educational needs are met for all students (computers/tablets, internet access, school supplies) -Provide appropriate instruction and supports to special education students -Provide quality training for staff members that will enhance their abilities to support students with challenges -Increase workforce diversity -Ensure transportation is provided so outside-of-the-school-day activities are available to all -Prioritize meeting the individual needs of each student.","Considering the big picture, though it was painful, yes. The loss of funding that was occurring because of a distrust of her and some in her administration by authorities ranging from our county government to our governor, appeared to be causing our school system to lose much more money than her (very large) payout. Also, irresponsible financial management was occurring, as exemplified by the tremendously underfunded and poorly planned Teachers for Tomorrow program and, to a much greater fiscal extent, the health and dental fund. The elementary school model world language program was an expensive initiative that was not well planned, thus it was unlikely to perpetuate. Programs of questionable value, fiscally and otherwise, were implemented, such as the Gallup Strengths initiative. Furthermore, under Dr. Foose, the Howard County Education Association job satisfaction survey item, ""I have confidence in the leadership exhibited by the HCPSS Superintendent,"" had only 10.8% agreement; the cost, financial and otherwise, to the school system from this lack of confidence was probably quite significant. She also lost the confidence and support of the community, exemplified by the 2016 elections when the three Board of Education members who supported her were voted out. The constant discord between Dr. Foose and the new Board appeared to prevent much meaningful progress from occurring, and the consequences of three additional years of dysfunction would have likely resulted in a significant cost to the county both financially, from legal costs and lost revenues as described above, and educationally.","I would give Dr. Martirano's performance an ""A-"". I don't feel that I can give his reorganization of the central office a grade yet, as it still appears to be in the works; presently (4/11/18) the HCPSS website states: ""The Superintendent's recommended budget had incorporated significant reductions in central office staff, particularly the elimination or repurposing of 29 central office positions…"" Also, I would want to see his reorganization in operation before giving it a grade. I think that most of the changes he has made so far have been effective, though I think that the central office could be set up more efficiently; I am expecting that his proposed reductions will address this, and are probably at least a positive step. The ""A-"" grade for Dr. Martirano' performance might be a bit conservative. I refrained from an ""A"" because of occasional concerns; for example, with our budget challenges among the reasons, I did not think that an interscholastic middle school basketball program was a suitable proposal. Overall, though, I feel at this point that Dr. Martirano has faced great challenges and addressed them in ways I consider to have been intelligent, thoughtful, and considerate. He has generally been open to listening and considering the thoughts of others. He seems to sincerely be very student-oriented. His nature has been very cooperative, transparent, and respectful, yet he has demonstrated courage and decisiveness when appropriate. I believe that his leadership style, work ethic, and enthusiasm also add to his effectiveness.","With rising concern over school safety, should county police officers or sheriff's deputies be assigned to all public schools, along with additional screening methods, such as metal detectors, student pat-downs and clear backpacks?","Is the county school system's program to reduce crowded schools through redistricting an effective method given projected shifts in population growth, housing development plans?","Superintendent Michael Martirano has shifted budget priorities and is proposing to eliminate a world language program that's in place at eight (of 41) Howard County elementary schools and his budget might require increasing class sizes, by one student, in several middle and high schools.

Are these prudent choices?",The system's health fund has been in the red for several years — the deficit projected at $50 million by this summer — and Mr. Martirano has requested one-time funds from the county to start to pay down the deficit.

A tenured full professor and Coordinator of Professional Development and Communication at Morgan State University, I earned my doctorate in applied linguistics (with a specialization in literacy) from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, as well as my second M.A. degree (in sociolinguistics). My first M.A. is in TESOL, from Chicago. I started out as a tenure-track Asst. Professor at The University of Memphis in 1997, and took an early year-long sabbatical to work as the Lead Ontologist/ Knowledge Engineer for a research group that contracted with tech giant HP in Silicon Valley. I have also taught at George Mason University, Salisbury University, and the College of Education in Azare, Northern Nigeria. From 2014-2016, I had the honor of serving as one of 10 global Ambassadors for Childhood selected by the Association for Childhood Education International and the Alliance for Childhood. I am currently ACEI's U.S. Liaison. I just finished serving on the Board of the National Association for Bilingual Education and am Education Advisor to The Unforgotten (www.unforgotten.org). My father taught geography all over the world, so I completed my elementary and high school education, as well as my first degree abroad. I picked up Hindi, English, Yoruba, Hausa, and Nigerian Pidgin in my childhood, and learned French and Spanish as a teenager--primarily from children, as documented in my first book, The Child Language Teacher: Intergenerational Language and Literary Enhancement (2010, Mysore: CIIL). It chronicles how I taught my mother English when I was in second grade, and how this transformed my academic and social skills. I learned Spanish from a 5-year-old and I am convinced that children and young adults have the potential to be some of our best teachers. Enhancing student, parent and community engagement is one of my top objectives. I would like us to give our students, their families, and interested residents (e.g., retired seniors) an opportunity to share their talents and skills through cross-age and cross-language camps. My building-blocks cultural competency model won me the inaugural Diversity and Inclusion award from the Association for Business Communication International. I was invited to deliver a (luncheon) plenary address at the 82nd Annual Conference in Dublin, Ireland (October, 2017). I am helped start the Howard County African American History Project (HCAAHP; http://hchsmd.org/hc-african-american-history-pr/), a subcommittee of the Howard County Historical Society, and have been serving as Director. We began recording the educational experiences and of the earliest residents on Fels Lane (Ms. Sophie Pollock who turned 99 on Jan. 17, 2018—attended the historic Colored School). I also Co-Directed (with Tyrone Tyler) The Fire Next Door, a mini documentary on the 1965 fire on Main Street in Ellicott City, MD (near the Fire Station) that killed an African-American mother and four of her children. As an expert in reading and early childhood, I was invited to serve on the Validation Focus Group for MD-HSSCO Needs Assessment Project in 2013, and I've served on PTA sub-committees and even taught ESL as a volunteer in Howard County for over 15 years.","I have been teaching for 28 years, and the last 17 have been dedicated to teacher education. I'm a proud parent of two HCPSS students, a trained educator, and a teacher educator. I have also been actively involved in the educational policy realm, particularly through my advocacy on behalf of a number of international and national children's and young adult organizations. These include the ACEI, the NAEYC, CAEP (the largest accrediting body), NCLR, ACTFL, NABE, TESOL, ABC (Association for Business Communication International), AAAL (the American Association of Applied Linguistics), IAWE (the International Association for World Englishes), as well as NGOs like the Unforgotten (www.unforgotten.org).

I was an invited Speaker at the U.S. House of Representatives Briefing on the P-12 Language Pipeline hosted by U.S. Representatives Don Young and David Price on Dec. 6, 2016, and have provided testimony on education (and one other House bill) in Annapolis on more than one occasion.",(443) 422-5923,anitapandey4boe@gmail.com,http://www.anitapandeyboe.org,AnitaPandeyforBOE,Pandey4BOE,,"SROs have already been assigned to HC schools, yet there is the potential that the racial and socio-cultural differences between SROs and minorities, particularly black males, could facilitate the school-to-prison pipeline that research shows to have such a reach. Our schools should not feel and look like prisons. They must be welcoming places--a home away from home. While I understand the rationale behind additional screening methods employed at airports, when we implement these at school, including metal detectors and student pat-downs, and when we require the use of only clear backpacks, we send the message that we don't trust our students and we potentially exacerbate student and parent stress related to safety. These measures alone will unlikely prevent school violence, particularly when schools have multiple entry points (as they should) and portables or annexes, as do many HoCo schools. Locking all front doors and screening access can only go so far. There are times when doors have to be open to ensure efficiency, as when students enter and exit buildings. We must build trust and bridge divides. We should invest in mental health identification and intervention, and happiness-enhancement for all, including teachers and staff. Wellness sessions such as yoga, healthier, culturally diverse and hot meal options, conflict mediation and mood-enhancing sessions would go a long way. Following the example of Bhutan, students and teachers could be invited to rate their own and peers' PH (personal happiness), FH (family happiness), and SH (school happiness) on any given day and time.","Given the need for physical space and the fact that renovations are still in the works (e.g., for Hammond) and new schools are not ready to house students, redistricting is the most viable method available to the Board. Once High School 13 is ready, we should be able to brainstorm other options, such as building upwards at existing school sites, reducing housing development projects or reserving specific housing projects and making them affordable for teachers, so that all HoCo teachers can have the opportunity to reside in HoCo.","There are ways to address the budget shortfall without eliminating world languages in the early years--when children are naturally disposed to acquire multiple languages with little to no effort--and without increasing class size. As a linguist, parent, and policy advocate, I can vouch for the value of more than a single language in accelerating our students' social skills and overall academic performance across the board, from reading to math and science. We must aim to add WLs to all P-3 programs and offer (two-way) dual language in HCPSS, to further enhance our students' success on the global stage, as do schools in multiple states (e.g., Utah). We can address mental health issues --not just of students, it should be noted--using measures that add little to nothing to our budget. There is little research to back the claim that the presence of social workers, and of a specific number of social workers and/or school counselors, for that matter, correlates to reductions in mental health issues. On the contrary, some incidents might have been catalyzed by what was perceived by the wrong-doer as non-responsiveness on the part of a school counselor. A school watch program akin to a neighborhood watch program which simultaneously empowers and enlists the help of all parties--students, parents, teachers, staff, and residents--is likely to build trust, bridge divides, and yield enhanced outcomes. Cultural competency-enhancing sessions such as ""restorative justice practices"" aim to achieve exactly this, and with little to no added expenditure involved.","In my view, there is no simple nor single solution to this ""problem."" I would propose returning to the days when the State (legislature) paid teacher's retirement and health benefits, instead of the School Board (e.g., in the 80s). In the interim, possible measures we could explore include the following: • Teachers could be invited to pay more into the plan • Deductibles or copays could be increased (with teachers' knowledge and consent, of course), and/or • Health care and dental insurance providers could be urged to agree to a fixed amount for a set number of years (like multi-year contracts) and/or or to minimize increases in health care premiums for teachers and other School Board employees. The Board might consider conducting a utilization study to determine which health and/or dental services are most utilized, and based on the findings, make some budget re-allocations that are proportionate to the needs and/or utilization practices. In short, the Board could transition to paying more for the most utilized services and less for less- or minimally utilized services, for instance. Taking a close look at the budget might also yield some cost savings, and last but not the least, we must ensure that the Board has flexibility to transfer funds from one budget category to another. It should be noted that County Executives who disallow line-item budget transfers make it harder for our School Board to balance the budget.","HCPS' efforts to reduce the ""achievement gaps"" are promising, yet more CAN and MUST be done in this area. We must begin by ensuring that low-income and special needs students, among others that are identified as at-risk (socially and otherwise) and/or underachieving have additional and sustained supports in place at school, as well as outside school--through mentoring programs, reading, writing, financial and other kinds of literacy, and family and community engagement, for example. Diversifying our workforce and curricular diversification are also in order. In many ways the gap in test scores is much like the ""word gap"" (VocabCultBiasTCRecordPandey.pdf). Multilingual messaging in front offices and throughout our schools will send a clear message of inclusion. When we show that we care and can relate to every student, then we all succeed.Howard County's diversity is one of the top reasons for our high residential ratings. We must begin by identifying the roots of the ""achievement gap"" and comb through the data carefully because we might find that, while blacks as a whole score fewer points than their Caucasian and Asian counterparts, black females actually perform quite similarly to the comparison/control groups. We must utilize more qualitative data and not just quantitative data. I would argue that most of the tests employed are culturally exclusive, as is the practice of ""testing"" per se (evidencing a competition-oriented culture of comparisons and contrast), which is why the use of non-intrusive (time-and otherwise), culturally inclusive alternative assessments, such as student portfolios is essential.","We cannot turn back the clock, so instead of evaluating the decision to pay the former Superintendent, we should work towards ensuring that local Boards of Education should have the right to terminate a Superintendent for cause. At the time, members of the Board thought it best to employ this strategy to remove from office an individual whose leadership could potentially have yielded negative outcomes. In my view, the use of monetary payouts as a retirement incentive should be avoided. I can understand why some states have put a cap on Superintendents' pay--to manage expenditure and prevent misuse of funds.","The renewal of Dr. Martirano's contract evidences his efficient leadership to date. From what I have seen and read, he is dedicated, professional and transparent, so I would rate his performance as ""very good."" His reorganization of Central Office has yielded greater efficiency, accountability, and multidirectional collaboration (personal communication). He is for ""open meetings"" (personal communication) and welcomes input from all stakeholders at Town Hall meetings. He clearly prizes inclusion, as evidenced by the three-part series offered this spring on ""restorative practices."" The successful creation and ready-to-roll-out community-wide interaction-enhancing program Talk with Me, Howard County, spear-headed by former HCPSS employee Bonnie Bricker, speaks to his community focus. At Town Hall meetings and through e-communication that he sends out, he invites community input, so his collaborative, student-focused (http://storystrong.hcpss.org/stories/), and community-engaged leadership is evident and appreciated. We must continue to support him and others on the Board and at Central Office—as well as community partners (current and future) to provide all Howard County teachers, staff, and students with safe and motivating learning spaces (e.g., by increasing access to pre-school) and utilize our diversity as a resource. We could, for instance, offer Classical languages and languages of national interest, such as Korean; and pilot cross-age English language programs to our large and growing ""ESL"" student population and their families—to bridge age, cultural, generational, and language divides, among other reasons. We should also pilot language camps for additional languages (e.g., Chinese, Hebrew, Urdu) run by students and their families.","With rising concern over school safety, should county police officers or sheriff's deputies be assigned to all public schools, along with additional screening methods, such as metal detectors, student pat-downs and clear backpacks?","Is the county school system's program to reduce crowded schools through redistricting an effective method given projected shifts in population growth, housing development plans?","Superintendent Michael Martirano has shifted budget priorities and is proposing to eliminate a world language program that's in place at eight (of 41) Howard County elementary schools and his budget might require increasing class sizes, by one student, in several middle and high schools.

I am against the use of metal detectors in schools. It gives a false sense of security to parents while making the children feel as though the schools are not safe. For metal detectors to be effective access to schools must be tightly controlled and always monitored, day and night, otherwise weapons can be brought in, hidden and used at a later time. Clear backpacks do nothing to prevent violence. Someone who wanted to bring in a weapon could still do it by wrapping it in something. Gym bags or sports bags are a larger and thus easier to hide a large weapon in.  Regarding officers in the schools, the focus should be developing positive relationships with students not simply policing the halls. I would like to see a highly selective screening process and extensive training prior to officers being placed in the schools. This has the potential to build more positive community relations with law enforcement but only if carefully initiated. It is difficult to help a child get past the fact that they may have had bad experiences with the police in the past. To achieve it we must have officers who take a different approach to student interaction. I would like to see the race any officers assigned to a school be reflective of the student population. We need common sense measure such as securing the schools but as we know there are always way around the most sophisticated security plan.","Last year, rather than make the difficult decision to redistrict several overcrowded high schools, the decision was made to use a form of open enrollment to address the problem. While the Jump Start program provided relief at one high school, others are still dangerously overcrowded. The decision not to redistrict also forced the choice as to the location of the new high school. Redistricting would have provided more time to identify a location closer to the over crowded area.  Poorly designed schools districts have made redistricting a nightmare. We are faced with a variety of issues. People tend to dislike redistricting, it is stressful and disruptive. Schools are often set at the edge of their district rather than being central to the district.The cost of new school construction continues to rise. We also have multiple schools that are under enrolled which leads few sections of classes being offered and larger class sizes. When we have schools that are overcrowded adjacent to under enrolled schools, we must redistrict. It is the only financially responsible decision. New school construction should be used when the entire region is facing over crowded school. We also need to evaluate districts regarding the socioeconomic and racial composition. All students can benefit from a diverse school population. We should never have school be segregated at any level. Our children should be in brick and mortar schools, not portables. If we don't redistrict our children will continue to be educated in trailers..","I believe strongly in equity for our students. That is why I would have liked to see the World Language program in our Title 1 schools continue. But this program, while it is certainly worthwhile for our students, lacked a secure funding source. There are many excellent programs that could be added to our schools, but they must have funding. So if the funding does not increase we must decrease an area of spending. What other programs would be cut? By increasing class sizes, we are impacting all students in the county in a negative manner. We also must evaluate how this affects the county's ability to secure funding for new school construction from the state.  There is a need in our schools in increase mental health services. Our schools are the front lines for addressing these issues with our children. But it is wrong to place the entire burden of this on our schools. We need to be working with our already established community resources to address these problems and the funding should not come at the expense of our educational programs. Mental health is not just an issue for the schools, and the schools can't fix the problem without support from and for the families and communities. The county and state need to increase funding specific to this issue. The question is are these decisions prudent. In light of a deficit of $50 million, the options were few and the decisions are difficult but had to be made.","The county needs to assist with fixing this problem for the good of the school system and the entire county. The county has the rainy day fund and this may be the time to use it. The problem is serious and can not be allowed to drag down the school system. Good faith negotiations with the teachers' unions must continue. Teachers should not be paying for the past deficit, however there may need to be adjustments to what the will pay in the future for the health care as those cost rise for all.","HCPSS has shown mixed results when it comes to reducing the achievement gap for our students of color and economically disadvantaged. Many schools struggle with this, but one school, Hammond High has excelled. Hammond is a diverse schools in the county both racially and socioeconomically. Named as a ""School of Opportunity"" for 2017,it has increased graduation rates significantly for minority students and special needs students. The school encourages students to take more challenging courses including AP classes and provides various supports to help students achieve more. They use restorative practices and the culture between staff and students at the school was described as the best the reviewers have ever seen.  HCPSS is looking to increase the use of restorative practices in the county which I fully support. To succeed this will take time and training. It will require that not only do the administrators and staff have to believe in what they are doing but the community also need to buy into the system. For some communities, this will be a challenge. Many want to continue the with the punitive form of discipline, however that only lead to a greater inequity of discipline for students of color, special needs students and those of lower income. What we have been doing doesn't work, what we have been doing fuels the school to prison pipeline. To break it we need to examine what schools like Hammond are doing well and start to institute it at other schools.","The school board can hire a superintendent but they are not able to fire them, that must be done through the state. The situation between the Board and Dr. Foose was preventing work from being accomplished for the school system and the good of the students. I feel it was inappropriate the board renewed her contract in spite of the concerns raised by the public. While she did not deserve the payment and benefits she received, having her agree to resign was worth it in the end. Had her leadership continued the school system would have its leadership stuck in a persistent battle that would have only damaged HCPSS and our students.","One of the most important things that Dr. Martirano has brought to the county is a sense of hope to our school staff. Under Dr. Foose's leadership, there was fear, staff did not feel that they could speak their mind or they may face retribution. So Dr. Martirano is rebuilding that trust with our teachers that is so important. While his idea to use Jump Start rather than the unpopular idea of redistricting high schools showed he was thinking outside of the box, it came at a time when he was seeking to become the permanent superintendent and may not have been the right decision for our students. He built a strong leadership team, something that was lacking previously by creating the Community Superintendents and adding a Director of Diversity.

I think such policies are a knee jerk reaction with little evidence supporting their effectiveness. I do, however, support the presence of school resource officers. School resource officers are different from police officers because they are better trained to work with and around school children and for dealing with the situations that arise in schools. I believe they're essential for enhancing school safety and for building productive relationships with students. They can be trained and utilized as instructors in Criminal Justice and related fields, where they can develop positive relationships with students. From there, they can provide more meaningful interventions if needed. As far as additional measures, I do support some of the immediate measures we can take: screening process for all visitors, locked facilities, and so on. However, I want to ensure that we provide a comfortable learning environment for students. They shouldn't feel like they're entering a prison with metal detectors and pat-downs. This includes the radical and poorly thought idea of arming teachers. Some believe we should arm classroom teachers so they can defend the classroom from violent intruders. I am against this completely and strongly believe that teachers should not take on additional responsibilities like security. That must be left to the trained personal like school resource officers.","Ultimately, the County Council controls the decision as to where the new development gets approved. Moving forward, there must be collaboration between them and the Board of Education (BOE) on these decisions. Unfortunately, we've avoided making tough decisions at BOE level because of lack of leadership. Every year, the Board receives a feasibility study that provides population growth projections, among other things. Despite these reports showing trends that implied possible overcrowding, the board failed to make the necessary decisions. They failed to start the process to ensure a new high school was built when needed. They failed to redistrict to ensure that some of the schools didn't reach a point of unhealthy utilization (140%). As a result, students don't receive all the necessary resources they need due to overcrowding. Until HS#13 in Jessup is opened, it is essential that we redistrict in order to eliminate the overcrowding at some schools. Students in 8th or 9th grade today do not benefit from the Jessup decision, and we deny them the best possible education when we continue to push them through overcrowded schools. The school board needs to make planning for high school #14 a priority TODAY. By the time high school #13 in Jessup welcomes its first students in 2023, we will be long past the necessary time for a fourteenth high school. Looking ahead, we should plan so that we avoid redistricting, or at least have a long-term strategic redistricting plan when new schools come online.","I agree with the increase of social workers to tackle mental health issues but that's where the agreement ends. I don't agree with the Superintendent's budget priorities as I don't think they are in line with students' best interest. I don't agree with increases in class size because I think it negatively affects teachers' ability to commit full attention to each student. Our inability to adequately plan for student population increases has led us to depend on portable classrooms which I think at minimum are depriving our children of a healthy school experience. At worst, they are a security risk. I think the current status quo endorses too many top-heavy administrative policies and the budget is suffering. We can accomplish a great amount by prioritizing student first policies. We should hire teachers before hiring administrative staff. Right now, we leave too much money on the table with our current policies of sole sourcing, non-competitive bids and preferred vendor awards where we do not receive the best pricing. The policies in place today are the same ones we've for years. I think it's time for a change. I think we can make better policies that don't eliminate competition and any potential savings. We desperately need a modern, transparent procurement process.","Teachers should not be penalized for the mistakes of the past administration. Howard County Public Schools needs to right their fiscal ship. We can do this by tightening our procurement processes, making sure the right priorities are properly budgeted and working with the County Council and County Executive to eliminate this hopefully one-time issue. We have to abandon the policies of the status quo. Right now, we lack transparency and a Board that has the procurement and financial experience and expertise to approve a fiscally-sound budget. It's extremely important that we elect the people who have proven expertise and experience in these areas so this never happens again.","Given achievement gaps between students of different races, I think it's obvious that lot more still needs to be done. I think HCPSS tries hard to reduce these gaps, it's just that we've been unsuccessful. We can't expect a policy change to have an impact overnight. Today, high school students of different achievement levels are a result of the less-equitable policies of their elementary and middle school education. The policy we enact today won't be seen in entirety until years from now. So the key to solving this important issue is constant vigilance and constantly re-evaluating our policies. We have to think outside of the box. Implicit bias no doubt contributes to the achievement gap, but there are other factors as well. Due to a continued legacy of racism in this country, there are other ""gaps"" between racial groups (income, home life, etc.) and it affects the psychology of each students accordingly. Some policies we see as completely normal may impact students differently given these differences and they may be more pronounced on racial lines. There are multiple issues that I don't think we've looked at from the lens of equity. Class sizes, equal access to quality facilities, access and use of uniform technology, longer lunches are a few that come to mind. There are policies that are subtle that influence student outcomes and we have to look at the patterns in the system as a whole.","The entire Renee Foose situation was unfortunate for everyone involved. We would not have been in that situation had there been more transparency on the Board and the superintendent. In the past, too many superintendents have shown little regard for community collaboration. That needs to change. We need to know how taxpayer money is being spent and that's going to require transparency and open communication by both the Board and the superintendent.. We need to make the right reforms where the county isn't put into an impossible situation. We're in a bad place when we need to spend over a million dollars to prevent long-term harm to our schools that could be worth tens of millions of dollars more at minimum. The biggest concern isn't the money, it's the possibility of ruining our children's future with bad education policies. I recognize that it was a tough decision by the board, but I would have made the same choice. $1.6 million is a lot of money, but the price tag for keeping Renee Foose around would have been much higher. To me, this is an example of a systemic problem in Maryland state schools. A Board can hire the superintendent, their only employee but cannot fire them for not performing their duty. This type of rules fails to deter negligence and it's ultimately the taxpayers and the students who foot the bill of the superintendent. This needs to change.","Overall, I believe Mr. Martiano is very engaged, has a grasp of the fundamental issues and is taking the leadership role needed for his position. In terms of his reorganization, I favor a flat organization where management is more connected with the staff, the school and community. Therefore, I do not agree with many of his policies where he is adding additional administrative staff from community supervisors to some additional new positions that carry a hefty price tag as we are paying above market rate for some of these positions. With a $50 million budget deficit, where he is recommending cuts in programs, increasing class sizes, increasing portable instead of looking for brick and mortar solutions, I am baffled at the budget priorities and how these are getting passed by the board. I think it's more important than ever that our current superintendent ensures every decision made is carefully evaluated to ensure that it is student focused. I also don't agree with the process where he announced the new security measures. He failed to discuss these measures with his employers, the Board of Education, and the community. A decision that directly affects every child within the school system should have been made transparently with the Board and the community should have been allowed to voice their input. So, his intentions were good and I still believe in his ability to work effectively with the board and community, but he does not receive a passing grade on how this was handled.","With rising concern over school safety, should county police officers or sheriff's deputies be assigned to all public schools, along with additional screening methods, such as metal detectors, student pat-downs and clear backpacks?","Is the county school system's program to reduce crowded schools through redistricting an effective method given projected shifts in population growth, housing development plans?","Superintendent Michael Martirano has shifted budget priorities and is proposing to eliminate a world language program that's in place at eight (of 41) Howard County elementary schools and his budget might require increasing class sizes, by one student, in several middle and high schools.

To that end, I am only speaking about Howard County Public Schools. Our safety and risk needs have internal (i.e., providing adequate support and mediation for students and enhancing the role of SROs, enhance background investigations for Substitute Teachers, etc.) and external (access to school buildings) considerations to be explored. I do not support having sheriff's deputies, metal detectors or student pat-downs in our schools. The climate of a school directly contributes to the level of risk, and there is still too much that we have yet to consider/implement to support troubled students, before creating a quasi-criminal culture that will disproportionately criminalize special education and minority students.","HCPSS' only immediate option to reduce overcrowding at the most negatively impacted schools is redistricting, to ensure that the thousands of students affected receive an equitable education. However, we must remember that the severe overcrowding didn't begin with HCPSS, but is a product of County-level development decisions. Therefore, to continue to depend upon redistricting is unreasonable and unsustainable. Going forward the County must implement and show commitment to smart growth, through developer limitations, improved APFO regulations and putting the community ahead of special interests. Growth at the expense of the quality of life and the quality of education that makes HoCo a community of choice will backfire.","I have served as the Community Advisory Council (CAC) representative on the Operating Budget Review Committee for the Board of Education and Superintendent 2-years, and I know the details of the budget and the student performance outcomes for the Elementary School Model and the aforementioned world language program. So, while it was not the popular choice to dismantle, it was the wise and most equitable choice. I vehemently oppose increasing class size for ANY reason, because there isn't any reliable national research that does not indicate a direct and negative impact on students and teachers when class sizes are increased. Regarding the increased staffing of social workers, I agree with the idea, because HoCo schools are experiencing mental-health and trauma induced needs across all student groups. However, social work is only a one-dimensional aspect of addressing the needs. Therefore, I will and have been advocating for performance measures and data-driven staffing plans to address the need for additional Certified Special Education Teachers, Behavioral Specialists, Trauma-Care Specialists, and Psychologists in addition to Social Workers.","The union(s) and school system are still in negotiations. As a Human Resources professional, who held the Senior Professional Human Resources (SPHR) designation for sixteen-years, I consider public ridicule and backseat driving that is based upon rumor detrimental to on-going negotiations. The bottom line is that absent each side conceding in something, our children and staff will be the ones dealing with the negative impact of the current and growing deficit. The current deficit is now publicly known to have been largely caused by wasteful spending in the past (before Dr. Martirano). As your Board of Education member, I will focus on 1) pursuing legislative funding remedies to address the rapidly increasing and diverse student enrollment of HCPSS, 2) working with the Superintendent to implement industry recognized best practices for spending oversight and resource allocation, and 3) seeking organizational efficiencies - not arbitrary cuts, that ensure that our bidding, contracts and procurement on the Operation and Capital budgets are not used as proverbial jackpots of gold by all entities doing business with HCPSS.","More work absolutely needs to be done, because HCPSS' PARCC outcomes have consistently shown that a full 45% - 55% of our students are not meeting expectations in Math and English proficiency. I will evaluate each program's effectiveness by its measurable impact relevant to each student group. I will support funding for programs only if the performance measures/student outcomes show improvements. I also believe that the BOE has to effectively address the unique needs of immigrant, FARMS and Special Education students and consider national models of success for these student groups. Finally, where parents are not involved, I would like to see specific focus on community integration programs/models that engender parent/school partnerships and that support parents who want their children to succeed, but need a little mentoring to do so. If we continue to do things the way that we always have, the gap will increase and the negative results on our community and economy (regardless of socio-economic level or zip code) will be severe.","Unfortunately, yes because to not do so would have cost HCPSS more in litigation. However, this goes back to addressing employment contract terms at the onset and having the courage and legal basis/language to cancel employment contracts. If termination terms/definitions ""for cause"" covering the performance and leadership issues that have been publicly debated regarding Dr. Foose were included, our community could have avoided the $1.6million loss to the Operating Budget. My recommendation is not limited to Dr. Foose, but in every Superintendent contract situation, it is the Board's responsibility to ensure that poor performance and/or issues of cause are not rewarded with contract buy-outs. Moreover, despite the very real concerns expressed and growing in the community, Dr. Foose's contract was renewed. As a Board Member I will not be opposed to having some oversight/accountability before a Board is able to renew a contract if a similar situation occurs in the future.","It is too soon and unfair to grade, because I will consider Dr. Martirano's performance based upon data/outcomes and any measurable student impact(s), in direct relation to the reassignments and the corresponding costs associated with the Administration Teams salaries.","With rising concern over school safety, should county police officers or sheriff's deputies be assigned to all public schools, along with additional screening methods, such as metal detectors, student pat-downs and clear backpacks?","Is the county school system's program to reduce crowded schools through redistricting an effective method given projected shifts in population growth, housing development plans?","Superintendent Michael Martirano has shifted budget priorities and is proposing to eliminate a world language program that's in place at eight (of 41) Howard County elementary schools and his budget might require increasing class sizes, by one student, in several middle and high schools.

The public understandably seeks quick, visible measures such as the ones mentioned above. Unfortunately, the data does not point to the efficacy of these solutions. Instead, we should take a measured approach rooted in research to implement solutions that actually create safer schools, rather than feel-good measures that leave the community with a false sense of security. Soon after Parkland, experts gathered to outline recommendations for increasing school safety. Recommended responses included the following: 1) make it harder to acquire guns by implementing universal background checks, banning assault-style weapons, and adopting sensible gun-control measures; 2) invest in efforts to provide social and emotional services for students; 3) focus on a relationship-based model where students are encouraged to report concerns to an adult. (A staggering one-in-four middle and high school kids report seeing a weapon at least once a year, and in a majority of cases a shooter will communicate their intentions in some form to a peer;) 4) address the racial biases in disciplinary action so as to reduce suspensions through staff and student training; and 5) have a clear plan in place for assessing a situation when a student is identified as having a weapon or making threatening remarks. ""Triage"" teams should include key administrators, a trained psychologist, and an adequately trained school resource officer (SRO), where appropriate.","Yes. Redistricting to alleviate overcrowded schools seems like a necessary course of action. Though Dr. Martirano has taken temporary steps to alleviate overcrowding, a long-term solution is needed and redistricting will likely be part of it. Noting this, the most effective, least disruptive way to address overcrowding is to build more schools. Now that high school #13 has been chosen, the Board should set its sights on getting the school built while expediting the selection of high school #14. Simultaneously, the Board should seek to learn about efforts that have worked in other parts of the country to address overcrowding. For example, me might consider developing specialized academies in schools with excess capacity—e.g., around STEM, the arts, or coding—to draw interested students from overcrowded schools. I would also advocate for the Board to conduct a community-wide survey of parents to assess the extent to which solutions identified by the Board are likely to be embraced by the community.","Given the increased rates of mental illness in student populations and the benefits to be gained from building a relationship-based model for school safety, the addition of social workers will pay dividends on a number of fronts. I would like to see this happen at a faster pace but recognize the budgetary constraints that make this challenging. I am not in favor of increasing class sizes as research overwhelming suggests that small-class size is arguably the best method for improving student academic achievement and increasing teacher retention. This is particularly relevant given the need to close the achievement gap for the system's most vulnerable students. I believe Dr. Martirano and the county should do more to protect class size. I was particularly disheartened when Dr. Altwerger's proposal to exempt Title 1 schools from the class size increase was voted down; it seemed to me a short-sighted decision whose effects will largely fall on the backs of those most in need of additional attention. When the world language program was being implemented at some of our more vulnerable schools, the community was supportive of the program for the value it provided in building relationships. A cohort of teachers strongly advocated for the continuation of the program and in my view made a case for its value. Rather than drop the program as an expedient budget-saving measure, I would have recommended first assessing the benefits in relation to the cost.","The education system is the bedrock of our community and serves as a key economic driver for the county. The county needs to fund it as such. The U.S. has a shortage of teachers as the country experienced a 35% reduction in the teacher pipeline from 2009 to 2014. Maryland is an ""import state,"" which means our need for teachers exceeds the number of teachers in the Maryland pipeline. In addition, we continue to have an 8% attrition rate annually. (For teachers of color these figures are even higher.) The county and state need to do more to keep teachers teaching and to find ways to incent individuals to join the educator ranks. Reducing educator benefits may reduce budget outlays in the short-term but end up costing the county in the long-term if the teacher shortage worsens. The county should also support HB1180/CH0140, which provides loan repayment assistance to teachers. As an active member of the OBRC and a firm believer in revenue-based budgeting, I'm keenly aware that the system is operating at a deficit and choices need to be made. HCPSS must do all in its power to create a responsible budget while trying to minimize the damage to student success. The board should continue to look for savings in non-personnel costs like purchasing, equipment, and supplies. Dr. Martirano and the Board are trying to do their part. Now it's up to the county to do its part by fully funding the budget.","HCPSS has made progress in reducing the achievement gap but work remains. We know this gap leads to higher dropout rates, lower post-education wages, increased poverty, un-/under-employment, and social/emotional risks. A number of data-driven interventions with proven success could help break this cycle. These include: 1) Pre-K - based on 22 studies, children under five who participated in classroom-based early childhood education programs were less likely to be placed in special education, less likely to be held back a grade, and more likely to graduate from high school compared to peers who were not in such programs; 2) educator diversification - research shows that when students of color have a teacher of color, attendance, academic achievement, enrollment in GT courses, and lower disciplinary action result. Teachers of color also tend to stay longer in high-needs schools, which brings more stability to the school; 3) Implicit bias training - African American, Native American, Latinx, and special education children are disciplined at much higher rates than normal. Training will help correct these inequitable rates of suspension; 4) engaged, reflective curriculum - students do better when they are able to see themselves and their cultures in the curriculum. As a professor, I've seen firsthand how transformative this relatively simple effort can be in awakening a student's curiosity, engagement, and academic success.","Given that educator support for Superintendent Foose plummeted to 10% based on a 3,000 person survey administered by the Howard County Education Association; that nearly 900 people signed a petition to have her removed; and that the system's legal bills were mounting, I believe it was a sound decision in order to move the community to a place of healing. The decision was made behind closed doors and thus I don't have enough information to say whether this was a ""good"" or a ""bad"" decision but I believe it was right to take action. Going forward, the Board should set clear expectations and guidelines for its engagement with the superintendent so that the situation does not repeat itself in the future. The most successful relationship between a board and superintendent is one where you have a strong collaboration based on trust, transparency, and open communication. Such a relationship recognizes that student achievement is the primary goal. The superintendent is charged with oversight of the school district, the Board with representing the community, setting policies, and evaluating the success of the district's operations. The Board can best be held accountable to the community by ensuring that the superintendent meets mutually agreed upon goals for the district. I encourage the Board and Dr. Martirano to have trust-building exercises incorporated into a formal written policy that outlines the responsibilities of both parties to each other and the community.","In my view, Dr. Martirano has done a solid job. I've enjoyed working with him as an advocate and would look forward to working with him on the Board. He came into a system that had experienced considerable turmoil and rolled up his sleeves to begin to right the ship. He has begun to rebuild trust by being open to community engagement and his approach seems rooted in transparency, honesty and open dialogue. He seems to care about the welfare of the student body, his staff, and the community. The changes he's made to the central office thus far seem sensible. The costs associated with this office are not insignificant and thus it is critical that staff be properly deployed. I like that he has actively sought to diversify his leadership team, though I'd like to see more women join the team. I was pleased that he hired Dr. Kevin Gilbert and made this a position reporting directly to him. However, the jury for me is still out on: 1) whether he will make the hard but good decisions to position the school system for future success; 2) whether he will follow through on his stated desire to consult with the community before making key decisions; and 3) whether he will back his words around ensuring fairness and equity for all HCPSS students with sufficient resources to make this happen. Words only carry weight when they are supported with actions and resources.","With rising concern over school safety, should county police officers or sheriff's deputies be assigned to all public schools, along with additional screening methods, such as metal detectors, student pat-downs and clear backpacks?","Is the county school system's program to reduce crowded schools through redistricting an effective method given projected shifts in population growth, housing development plans?","Superintendent Michael Martirano has shifted budget priorities and is proposing to eliminate a world language program that's in place at eight (of 41) Howard County elementary schools and his budget might require increasing class sizes, by one student, in several middle and high schools.

We also need make sure our police force should have enough special dedicated training because they are working with schools and students with very diverse background. They should have culture competency and diversity awareness training. I be",I don't want to massive school redistricting for our students. I believe we should build more schools at the right location where we see student population grows. Redistricting is only a temporary solution to solve this over-development issue in the county. Working with the county to improve APFO is another important aspect in this dialogue. Overcrowding is also a safety concern we should always keep in mind and try to address and portable classroom number should go down gradually.,"This is a difficult choice for superintendent Martirano and the current board. The problem was caused by previous board. We should first make sure this same mistakes made by previous boards and previous superintendent will not repeat. The BOE should look both inside and outside. Inside the school system, we should make any school programs accountable to reduce waste, improve efficiency and reduce cost. Outside the school system, we should advocate for more funding from county government, state government and other possible funding resources. We should also communicate these difficulties to the parents. We may need to cut programs and service which will negatively impact some students. With their help and understanding, it is easier for the school system to move forward. The board should have a clear vision and direction how we can get out of the mounting deficit in an orderly manner. If BOE has to cut programs, I will make sure the school funds all programs which are legally required by the law. Anything outside the scope should be reevaluated based on the purpose, past performance, cost efficiency, return of investment and many more factors. When cut needs to happen, all status-quo or establishment forces will come out against the cut. As a board member, I will make sure objective opinions prevail.","I believe the county government should find ways to fund this one-time fund to pay down the deficit. The county government, county council, teacher union and HCPSS should work together to address this serious fiscal problem and have a clear plan to solve this deficit problem as soon as possible. It will not go away automatically and it means we should expect compromises from all stakeholders, although it was created by the current stakeholders unfortunately.","We definitely need do more to help our students to succeed. We should focus on each individual student, understand the struggle, create a success plan for each of them, and work with their teachers, families and communities. We should promote more vocational and technological training in HCPSS as an alternative career path. This will give our students and families more choices and freedom to plan for their future. It will not be an easy job. It may take very long time and dedicated effort to make sure all of students, regarding races and social-economical background will succeed.","This is an unfortunate choice for the board. However, this is better than the situation that the former superintendent Renee Foose was sticking around and fighting ugly with the school board.","I grade Dr. Martirano's performance ""A"". He communicates with the community well and seeks common ground while making important decisions.","With rising concern over school safety, should county police officers or sheriff's deputies be assigned to all public schools, along with additional screening methods, such as metal detectors, student pat-downs and clear backpacks?","Is the county school system's program to reduce crowded schools through redistricting an effective method given projected shifts in population growth, housing development plans?","Superintendent Michael Martirano has shifted budget priorities and is proposing to eliminate a world language program that's in place at eight (of 41) Howard County elementary schools and his budget might require increasing class sizes, by one student, in several middle and high schools. He would like to increase the number of social workers — at a pace of three per year — to help students struggling with mental health issues. Are these prudent choices?",The system's health fund has been in the red for several years — the deficit projected at $50 million by this summer — and Mr. Martirano has requested one-time funds from the county to start to pay down the deficit. But higher health insurance rates are also in the cards; this is one apparent sticking point in the ongoing union contract talks. How do you believe this problem should be addressed?,How would you evaluate HCPS' efforts to reduce achievement gaps between students of different races and backgrounds? Does more need to be done?,Did the school board act appropriately in agreeing to pay former superintendent Renee Foose more than $1.6 million in salary and benefits to persuade her to resign?,How would you grade Mr. Martirano's performance and his reorganization of the central office?,School safety,Crowding,Budget,Health care costs,Achievement gap,Foose,Martirano
