I prefer to use taxpayer money on schools than to provide corporate welfare.  From the beginning, the TIF was a mistake. Proponents of the TIF say that growth in Downtown Columbia is inevitable but it would take more than 25 years without the additional incentive. Like taking steroids to accelerate muscle growth, proponents want to accelerate growth by using the TIF and bring about the inevitable sooner.  This is a bad deal for tax-payers, for our students and teachers as it takes money away from essential needs. It will put additional burdens on our citizens as the County will be forced to raise more debt to deal with the negative consequences of accelerated growth. It risks the County's AAA credit rating.  This is especially egregious since Howard Hughes is exempt from the county's APFO policy. TIF's can lead to abuse of county taxpayer money and gentrification of neighborhoods.","The debate surrounding school safety is just another example of special interest influence gone awry. Instead of discussing ways to increase gun safety and reducing access to weapons of mass murder, vulnerable populations with mental health needs are scapegoated and half-measures are proposed that seek to only militarize our schools.  We have reached an inflection point in our society where the adults have lost the ability to take sensible decisions that are based on facts and data. Our democracy has been hijacked by interest groups who have bastardized the values of freedom and our rights enshrined in the Constitution just to sell weapons of mass murder that are being used to mow down children in the halls of learning.  If we are to prevent gun violence and increase school safety, we need to take on the special interests and pass common sense gun reforms – universal background checks, taking guns away from domestic abusers, allowing the CDC and NIH to study gun violence as a public health issue, banning assault weapons – these are solutions favored by an overwhelming majority of citizens.","I reject the premise embedded in the question that privatizing services saves money and improves efficiency. Any institution requires strict oversight and it is as effective as the individuals in charge.   One of the areas of my campaign platform is to improve accountability by increasing the county's audit function, increased oversight in county departments, and eliminating the revolving door that currently sets a one year period before which a former member of the County Council is allowed to represent special interests whose matter is ""subject to legislative action"".","I reject the premise embedded in the question. There is NO building moratorium in place.   The ""affordable housing"" loophole of APFO is just another cynical ploy used by developers to weaken growth management tools of the county. For many years, developers have weakened the affordable housing standards by requesting exemptions and paying below market fees-in-lieu.  In its second annual report published in March 2014, the Columbia Downtown Housing Corporation (CDHC) said it is facing ""major structural impediments to achieving [its] affordable housing goal"". One of them was ""Developers do not have any legal or financial incentive to participate in helping us achieve our goal"".  The most effective way to provide affordable housing is to not provide exemptions to developers.","Local law enforcement should be in the business of enforcing local law.  From an economic standpoint, I do not want local taxpayer money to be used for immigration enforcement. I am running to be a steward of tax-payer money. We pay federal taxes to fund ICE.  From a public safety standpoint, I want local law enforcement to be engaged in community policing. Furthermore, to the extent that our adequate public facilities ordinance (APFO) does not have a way of measuring impact of growth on law enforcement, it is onerous to add scope to the duties of our local law enforcement. Communities are safer when they can feel safe to call the police without fear of attendant consequences.  Lastly, I'm an immigrant. I am alarmed at the current anti-immigrant climate and the many untrue assertions about people like me.","Ellicott City is an example of what happens when out-of-control, unmitigated growth meets environmentally sensitivity and geographically challenging terrain.   With growth, proper storm water management systems were not implemented. Now the taxpayer will cover the cost of improvements that developers should have paid. We need to do everything we can prevent floods in Ellicott City.","I think every discussion about the opioid epidemic should start with a discussion about the crack-cocaine epidemic and how the response destroyed many African Americans over the years. It was a criminal justice response rather than the more compassionate health crisis response.   Not only should we have an in-patient treatment center, we need to expand community training programs as well to help parents and family members cope with this crisis and give them the tools to identity symptoms and ideally prevention.","No. For many years, the county's priority has been providing unrestrained growth without collecting necessary mitigation impact fees for schools and roads. The tangible and intangible economic impacts of irresponsible growth has led to financial constraints.   If we are to invest in important infrastructure such as public transportation that becomes the preferred choice for many, we need to reverse course and charge developers the market-rate impact fees needed. This way, we don't use taxpayer money to service bonds and other expenses that developers should have paid for in the first place.",The constant yield property tax rate provision sets off a public hearing process if the local authority decides to raise the tax rate beyond the constant yield amount. Any effort to improve transparency of government action helps the county.   There are some areas where zero-based budgeting is optimal and others where it is not.

Port Covington n Baltimore is a good example of where a TIF was a useful tool to spur development. I would be open to looking at the possibility of utilizing TIF's for some of certain of our struggling village centers, as well as the Laurel Park Station project that has languished in North Laurel.","As a parent of two children in our public school system, there are few items more important to me than the safety of the children in our schools. I applaud our HCPSS Superintendent for looking to immediately improve security at high schools in the aftermath of the Parkland shootings, as well as collaborating with the County Administration and Police Department to improve safety across all schools. However, we need to strike a balance between security and maintaining a healthy educational environment, which is why I'm opposed, for example, to arming teachers. There should also be a wider community conversation involving the Board of Education, County Council and other stakeholders before implementing something as critical as this. In terms of utilizing law enforcement, I believe we should leverage those resources to augment our trained Security Resource Officers (or SRO's), rather than serve as a substitute to them. This is of special concern to students of color, as well as our immigrant student population. I also feel that we should, in addition to making sure we have SRO's at all of our schools, make better use of technology to enhance SRO's, and other safety protocols, as opposed to traditional screening methods like metal detectors and student pat-downs.","I think there are certain ""back-office"" functions where outsourcing could allow the county to operate more efficiently, and in a more cost-effective manner. Facilities management and operations would be an example of this. However, this should be limited to non-critical functions, departments, etc.  More importantly, I believe we should look to engage in public-private partnerships in the construction of new buildings. As a member of the Spending Affordability Committee, I was involved in the review process of the construction of our new courthouse, and found that we gain a good amount of efficiencies throughout that building's lifecycle, both construction completion ahead of traditional government procurement methods, as well as building operations and maintenance. We should look to leverage partnerships in the future for our correctional facility and other government buildings, including schools.","While I support the idea of increasing the amount of available affordable housing in our county, and appreciate that this allowance is subject to County Council review for each project, I don't believe the amendment passed was overall a responsible approach. Under the provision, it does not stop at the construction of affordable housing; rather, it allows for a full range of residential units to be built, provided the project includes the required amount of affordable housing. This opens the door to further impacting schools, roads and other infrastructure in areas that are already stressed; a better approach would be to allow APFO constraints to kick in, allowing infrastructure in those areas impacted to catch up with development that has already occurred. I believe we should have a larger conversation to address our growing need – and current shortage – of affordable housing, but I don't believe this is the solution.","I don't believe we need to have that designation in Howard County, as we already operating as such. As a result of discussions surround Council Bill 9, an agreement was negotiated between FIRM, Councilman Weinstein, County Administration and the Howard County Police Department that codified existing police policy where they do not enter into 287(g) agreements, or otherwise participate in mass deportation activities. I believe this agreement provides certainty to the county as well as our immigrant communities; however, should I find that the policy that came from the agreement is being violated, I would work to put in place corrective measures, up to and including the reintroduction of sanctuary legislation.  I do believe, however, that the county police should not be prohibited from reporting those that have committed crimes – especially violent crimes – to federal authorities, as any protections should apply to those that are obeying the laws of our county, state and country.","I believe we should continue to implement the recommendations presented in the Ellicott City Watershed Master Plan. This includes addressing conveyance systems, in conjunction with other means such as retention basins and prevention of additional runoff. We also need to be mindful of the effect of any new development in and around Ellicott City, requiring that any development mimics runoff capacity of ""woods in good condition"". In terms of tax dollars, implementation of the Plan will take a number of years, if not, decades, so I don't see why we can allocate funds accordingly, including the use of bond financing as necessary for certain construction projects necessary to achieve proper stormwater management.","I believe the opioid epidemic is not only a health crisis, but one of public safety. We are already on pace to break last year's record of overdoses and deaths, which broke the previous year's mark. In responding to this, we should take into consideration that this epidemic involves those engaged in criminal activities, as well as those that are victims, and any affected communities. In terms of the criminal aspects of this growing crisis, I would fully support the necessary funding to give our police department the tools to get distributors and other criminals off of the streets of our county, and the State Attorney's Office in prosecuting any and all perpetrators. I would, however, also look support those victims of this growing epidemic, including the construction of an in-patient drug treatment center (similar to the resource center we built in response to the chronic homelessness we have in our county).","As a county, we definitely need to increase our investment in all elements of public transportation. With respect to public transportation, we should go beyond making it something that certain segments of our population have to use, but something that all segments want to use. We should work harder with our partners at the RTA to make it a true regional network, and should require that any major development includes a traffic plan that addresses how public transportation will be incorporated.  We should also increase funding to accelerate the construction of the BikeHoward network. Walking and biking will never be viable forms of transportation in our county unless there are safe means by which to do so. This is especially true of areas like the Route 1 corridor where I live, it is dangerous right now to walk or bike along that roadway to the point where it unusable to anything other than travel by motor vehicle.","I do not support the recommendation of reducing the tax rate at this time. While it would be nice to be able to reduce taxes, we are already facing budgetary issues in Howard County, which will be exacerbated by the recently passed federal tax cut package. In fact, I would recommend that we as a county to a comprehensive view of our fiscal situation, both in terms of revenues and expenditures, to see how we can continue to deliver the services that contribute to the quality of life that we enjoy here, but in a fiscally responsible manner.  As part of our review, I would be open to exploring the possibility of adopting zero-based budgeting, as all indications are that it allows organizations to build a more structured approach to cost management, governance and accountability. Again, we need to be more fiscally responsible going forward, so we need to be open to any and all tools that facilitate that behavior.","What are your views on the use of tax-increment financing as an incentive for private building and redevelopment projects, including remodeling blighted village centers in Columbia?","With rising concern over school safety, should county police officers or sheriff’s deputies be assigned to all public schools, along with additional screening methods, such as metal detectors, student pat-downs and clear backpacks?",Are there any county government services that should be privatized to save money and improve efficiency?,Is a provision in the county’s recently adopted Adequate Public Facilities Ordinance that allows developers to build affordable housing in areas where a building moratorium is in place a responsible approach?,Is it appropriate for Howard to be a “sanctuary county” and prohibit county police from reporting detainees in the county detention center to federal authorities?,"What efforts, if any, should Howard County take to install more flood-control systems in and around Ellicott City, and how many tax dollars should be involved?",How would you respond to the opiod overdose epidemic?

As a current prosecutor, former legislative aide in Annapolis, and longtime Democratic activist, I have the experience necessary to achieve meaningful legislative action on the County Council. Working in juvenile justice in Baltimore City, I have seen countless shattered lives. I have witnessed young men and women who grew up with multiple generations of family members whose lives were predominated by periods of unemployment and incarceration, or punctuated by untimely deaths. These experiences have helped shape my desire for criminal justice reform. Elected to the Howard County Democratic Central Committee in 2014, I have partnered with others to help support real change to our community, including fighting to bring public financing to elections. As a member of the committee, I have voted in support of legislation banning conversion therapy. During my tenure as a legislative aide in Annapolis, I have had responsibility over a diverse legislative portfolio, from beginning the process of implementing phased retirement to reducing exposure to lead. If selected to serve on the Howard County Council, my experience shepherding legislation, working with stakeholders, bill drafters, and members of the community will help make me ready to serve on day one.",,Jenningsforhowardcounty,GregBJennings,http://surveygizmoresponseuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/fileuploads/296249/4299893/179-f6dda0fed08f93a822b32a5565779356_Headshot.jpg,"First, I have strong reservations about County Executive Kittleman's implementation of the Columbia TIF. Rather than seek approval from the County Council, he chose to divert pre-approved funds and abandon public ownership of the parking garage, all without a single public hearing. I do not support his unilateral change. Second, the Columbia TIF will create an increased need for school construction funding. The legislation will increase housing density in the area, resulting in approximately 6,400 housing units, exceeding the original Downtown Columbia Plan.  The surrounding schools will need to handle these additional pupils. I am concerned that insufficient resources have been allocated to compensate. Having a thriving downtown helps us all, but we do need to ensure that we develop the extra capacity required to absorb the new residents, employees, and children that change will bring without sacrificing the school system and surrounding services that made Howard County attractive to so many people.   Despite these reservations, I believe that TIFs can be a powerful tool. Other jurisdictions like Chicago have had success with their implementation, and they have used their excess revenue from their TIFs to fund public education. Howard County should do the same. I would examine each proposed new TIF, taking an honest look at the cost-benefit analysis, and making sure that it is beneficial to the long-term health of the community, not just the developer. Both the older village centers as well as Route 1 need investments, and TIFs may be part of the solution.","No parent should have to worry if they are sending their child to a school that isn't safe. On the Council, I will work to support common sense gun reform to ensure safety. As a current prosecutor in Baltimore City, I have seen firsthand the dangers of firearms and I have worked to secure convictions of those who would possess these dangerous weapons illegally. While serving as a legislative director, I worked on legislation banning assault weapons. I support comprehensive, common sense gun control, and I will do everything I can as an elected official and as an advocate to ensure that happens.  I support hiring more counselors and school resource officers (SROs), who are police officers trained to work with children. Well-trained SROs often forge a connection with the students and community.  Working on site, they can respond quickly if the situation necessitates. I also support efforts to make it easier for law enforcement to access video surveillance from a school system. By providing our first responders with better information, they will be better prepared to resolve these situations.   While I support several reforms to help make our students safe, I unequivocally do not support arming teachers. Many of my friends and family who became teachers did so because they wanted to change lives, not be faced with the possibility of ending them.  I generally do not support making schools feel more like jails, and I would be reluctant, absent additional information, to enact the other listed reforms.","While any government expenditure should be done in the most cost-efficient manner, privatization is not a panacea. I believe that our community benefits when government employees are trained, and we rely less on contractors to function. While contracting out may be necessary, excessive outsourcing of essential government services is not advantageous in the long run.   I do support procurement reform to ensure that government expenditures reflect our values and that services are delivered on time and on budget. I also believe that our tax dollars should go to companies that support their workers and pay their fair share. As Chief of Staff for Senator Victor Ramirez in 2014, I worked to help pass legislation which allowed the State to consider bidders' past labor and tax violations when awarding a State contract. I would support such legislation in Howard County.","I support a smart growth approach to development, which creates communities where everyone can live affordably, securely, and in harmony with nature. I oppose irresponsible sprawl development, and the lasting damage it does to our environment, the gridlock it creates, and the burden it places on our first responders. We need to make sure that we are building a community that works for working families through our development policies.  To properly serve as stewards of Howard County, we must make an investment in our public infrastructure. The profit motives of developers cannot be prioritized above the common good. To ensure the county's public infrastructure resources, I have supported including high schools in the school capacity tests, support efforts to impose reasonable utilization tests for elementary and middle schools, and support efforts to increase studying intersections and other traffic needs as part of the legislative solution. Additionally, I support a more regular and orderly process in the future. I support efforts by Councilmembers Terrasa, Ball, and Weinstein to revisit APFO following the County's comprehensive general plan revision. When the current round of revisions began three years ago, it had been over a decade since such an examination had taken place.  Howard County does need more affordable housing, especially for seniors and younger workers. While I do not want to undercut the reforms on APFO that have been achieved this year, I believe the flexibility provided by the exception is warranted.","I support Law Enforcement TRUST Acts. I believe that local police should be focused on enforcing the laws of our state and community, rather than responding to an unfunded federal obligation. I have worked on this issue on both a state and local level. As a member of the Democratic Central Committee, I fought for a resolution supporting TRUST legislation in Howard County, even when Democratic elected officials were on the fence or in opposition.  I know that many people are concerned that enacting such changes will make our communities unsafe. My experience as a prosecutor has confirmed to me that this will not happen. As a prosecutor, I have secured convictions against violent offenders who may now face possible deportation as a collateral consequence. Enacting Law Enforcement TRUST Acts, either statewide or in Howard County, will not prevent dangerous, violent criminals from facing the consequences of their actions.  Our immigrant communities, however, will not live in fear. They will be more likely to report crimes, more likely to come forward to testify, and more likely to feel part of the wonderful welcoming community that we want Howard County to be.","The Ellicott City Master Plan, implemented following the catastrophic flooding in 2016, sought to combat flooding. While this was a good first step, there are still flaws within the plan, leading some residents to lose faith that effective water management practices will ever be enacted.  Creating stormwater retention ponds, underground conveyances, and pipe farms are critical in combating flooding in Ellicott City. I would support efforts to this end. Unfortunately, the Ellicott City Master Plan currently does not provide for any additional limitations on development of the western part of the county located upstream from the city. As a result, further development of this rural part of the county combined with a lack of additional runoff management solutions means many of the same risks remain. We need to act to fix these problems too.  I support effective stormwater management policies. It is among the most significant source of water pollution in the nation, and the continuing failure to properly control such erosion and stormwater runoff can have dire consequences, especially to the Chesapeake Bay. I support programs akin to Rainscapes, a tax credit program used in portions of Montgomery County, which encourages local property owners to retrofit their lands to better manage stormwater. By encouraging private actors to adopt conservation landscaping's principles and utilize rain gardens, rain barrels, and permeable pavement alternatives, Howard County can see a dramatic improvement in its water quality and a dramatic decrease in pollution.","As a prosecutor, I know the scope of the opioid epidemic is staggering. I strongly support strengthening our diversion and drug education programs. Additionally, I support the efforts that make Narcan, a drug that can reverse the effects of an opioid overdose, available in all county buildings, and the training programs provided to County residents on how to administer it. These programs will save lives, and as a councilman, I would look for ways to expand and support this initiative.   As a county councilman I would work towards improving rehabilitation efforts within the county, including support for an in-patient drug treatment center.  I would support building the facility as fast as our budget constraints permit.","As a councilman for Howard County, I believe long-term investment in mass transit is crucial to the viability of my county, my State, and my country. We need creative and innovative transportation, applying new technology to help interconnectivity and improve our quality of life.  Like many Howard County residents, I have fought through the increasing traffic on our roads. For many who moved to Howard County from other areas suffering from high congestion, they know our next Council must ensure that we come up with both near-term solutions to lessen current congestion and long-term plans that keep our County on the right path.  By building mass transit, we can create jobs, boost domestic production of transportation equipment, reduce carbon emissions, and enhance the options available for commuters. Howard County needs a mass-transit system that is comfortable and convenient. We need to attract riders to reduce congestion on our roads and to absorb future growth. I would support adding additional routes as indicated by data on ridership rates. I support a plurality of mass transit options, especially making improvements to our existing bus system which is currently inadequate to support the needs of our flourishing community.  Howard County has not invested enough to make our community walkable and bikeable. We invest a pittance compared to our neighboring counties. I would support efforts to increase funding for the Howard County Bicycle Master Plan, and I hope that we can fully fund the endeavor when fiscally appropriate.","The State offers counties flexibility in setting their own constant yield property tax rate. The proposed rate is a significant reduction from the current rate of 1.15%, and the lower revenue would pose a problem for serving the needs of our residents. As the county with the State's fasting growing school system, I do not believe we can undertake such an action. I would support keeping the current property tax rate to ensure that we have the revenue necessary to keep our commitment to Howard County's students and their parents.  I would not support adopting zero-based budgeting. Starting from scratch each year would simply be repeating the work of past Councils, wasting valuable time where the Council can tackle other problems. As an unabashed policy wonk who is always looking for new ideas, I believe zero-based budget would limit our ability to restore Howard County to being a hub for bold ideas.","What are your views on the use of tax-increment financing as an incentive for private building and redevelopment projects, including remodeling blighted village centers in Columbia?","With rising concern over school safety, should county police officers or sheriff’s deputies be assigned to all public schools, along with additional screening methods, such as metal detectors, student pat-downs and clear backpacks?",Are there any county government services that should be privatized to save money and improve efficiency?,Is a provision in the county’s recently adopted Adequate Public Facilities Ordinance that allows developers to build affordable housing in areas where a building moratorium is in place a responsible approach?,Is it appropriate for Howard to be a “sanctuary county” and prohibit county police from reporting detainees in the county detention center to federal authorities?,"What efforts, if any, should Howard County take to install more flood-control systems in and around Ellicott City, and how many tax dollars should be involved?",How would you respond to the opiod overdose epidemic?

While we need to grow our commercial tax base, I generally do not support this type of incentive in Howard County since it poses significant economic and financial risks, can be difficult to monitor, and has the effect of more deeply involving the County in development projects than I think is appropriate.  Howard County is a relatively affluent and attractive jurisdiction for business location.  To the extent necessary, I prefer more straightforward and traditional development incentives such as grants, loans, or Payment In Lieu Of Taxes (PILOT) agreements.    By issuing TIF bonds with debt service to be defrayed by the tax increment of increased assessments in a special taxing district, a jurisdiction is assuming downside risks if the economy slides or the redevelopment otherwise fails.  However, the jurisdiction is anticipating that, over time, the economy and project will remain strong and that it will receive tax revenue benefits at least as great as its debt service obligations for possible other general fund uses.  Nonetheless, that is a long-term variable out of its control.   I pledge to provide strong oversight over the existing TIF in Downtown Columbia to ensure fiscal accountability and transparency.  I do not support TIF as a tool for redevelopment of any Columbia village center.","I support trained school resource officers (county police) being assigned to all public schools. Such officers are currently serving in all county high schools and several middle schools with some police coverage of elementary schools.  I support additional capital and operational measures to provide controlled entry to schools, improved door locks and safe spaces, modifications of ""open space"" floor configurations to enhance safety, portables security, and increased training with emergency response protocols and communication awareness.  Adequate funding of behavioral mental health and school counseling resources also is key. The County should seek additional State capital and operating assistance under the School Safety law recently enacted by the General Assembly.  I do not support the routine use of the additional screening methods posed by the question given the large number of students involved.","I do not support privatizing core governmental functions because of concerns over the risk of failed performance (insufficient planning, cost overruns, and poor service) and the need for strong oversight and accountability.  Privatization also increases the potential for conflicts of interest. Core governmental functions include functions like management of the jail, law enforcement, conducting regulatory inspections, etc.   Out-sourcing may be appropriate, after a thorough cost-benefit analysis, to meet short-term needs particularly when non-core functions are involved and/or when the government lacks the expertise or personnel or financial capacity to undertake a function. Examples would be specialized technology or health and human services, such as the assistance provided to vulnerable populations through Grassroots and HopeWorks. There also may be low risk ancillary services with discreet objective metrics that are appropriate for competitive bid such as for currently contracted solid waste collection services. To the extent lower skilled functions are involved, I believe that any outsourcing vendor should be required to provide a living wage at a minimum, and reasonable health and other benefits, to the vendor's employees or subcontractors.  It is important that the County continue to invest in efficiency and productivity improvements and I support the recommendations of the Spending Affordability Committee affirming the desirability of moving forward on software improvements for County payroll and procurement operations.","I have testified in favor or a strengthened Adequate Public Facilities Ordinance (APFO). Such APFO restrictions on development can conflict with other desirable public policies such as affordable housing. In enacting the final bill, the County Council added a ""safety valve"" amendment to allow subsequent Councils, after public input, to exempt certain affordable housing projects from building restrictions. The amendment is imperfect since it does not provide a clear legal standard for Council action other than consideration of certain limited criteria. This language may well need to be clarified. If elected, I pledge to do everything possible to ensure that this does not become an egregious loophole and exacerbate school overcrowding.","While I supported Council Bill 9-17, at this time, I do not believe that Howard County needs to legislatively declare itself a sanctuary jurisdiction. Subsequent to the veto of that bill, the Police Department adopted policy OPS-10 which achieved many of the key objectives of the legislation, including a statement that it had no authority to enforce civil violations of federal immigration laws and prohibits criminal investigations and enforcement based solely upon an individual's citizenship or immigration status. This lays an important foundation for establishing trust in law enforcement within our immigrant community. However, if the immigrant community experiences instances where OPS-10 is not being observed by the police department, I would support a carefully drafted bill that protects the rights of our immigrant populations.  On the question of reporting detainees in the county detention center to federal authorities, consistent with the former Obama Administration Priority Enforcement Policy, the County should honor federal detainers when a criminal alien in our custody has been convicted (rather than just arrested) of a felony or serious or multiple misdemeanors.","I support County Executive Kittleman's proposed capital budget request for $17.1 million to mitigate flooding in the Tiber Hudson sub watershed and to better protect Ellicott City, including storm drain improvements and the continued design of stormwater retention facilities identified in the 2017 Hydrologic and Hydraulic Analysis.  It appears as if the new money allocated to the specific Ellicott City CIP project for FY  2019 is $4.9 million with total appropriations through 2028 estimated at approximately $56 million.  Because many existing structures in Ellicott City should be retrofitted, we need to look at the recommendations of the Commercial Stormwater Solutions Workgroup to incentivize property owners through tax credits, grants, and loans to make necessary stormwater management improvements. I would support funding for that purpose.  Acknowledging the tight topographical conditions, redevelopment should be subject to stringent stormwater management requirements.  For undeveloped and flood susceptible areas in the Tiber-Hudson sub watershed, additional land use limitations may need to be considered at least until a more comprehensive strategy is in place.   The recent flooding caused by the extreme microburst is symptomatic of the climate change we are experiencing and a vivid example of what can happen if we think narrowly about commerce with minimal concerns about the environment. The loss of retail and service jobs from the flood is an example of why we need to consider the economy and our environment as one.  It is critical that the Ellicott City plan contemplate the resiliency of this community in the future.","Opioid overdoses continued to climb in 2017 in Howard County.  According to WMAR, Howard County experienced 228 overdoses of which 57 were deadly last year.  I would continue to utilize a multifaceted approach of increasing public awareness, education, and overdose treatment training, including use of Naloxone. I support the recently created Opioid Community Council and the seven day per week walk-in screening and referral services program provided at the Grassroots Crisis Intervention Center. I would support additional funding for mental health services targeted to substance abusers and others at risk. To the extent reasonable, the County should expedite construction of an in-patient drug treatment center.  Facility siting will be key, however, and community buy-in will require an open process and opportunity for input.  Law enforcement efforts targeting drug dealers need to be aggressively pursued as part of this multifaceted strategy.","We need to invest more in public transportation projects.  As Columbia and Howard County have become significant employment centers with greater population density in the Town Center and other locations, it is more important than ever to increase our County's investment in transit, including the regional bus network, Bike Howard, mobility services, and pedestrian access. With regard to transit, I support the recommendations and implementation strategy set forth in the January,  2018 Central Maryland Transit Development Plan to guide public service improvements in the region over the next 5 years.   For transit in Howard County, the Plan proposes a variety of enhancements including basic performance and service improvements, route reconfigurations and expansions, and additional capital investment.  Specifically, I support the recommendations for Bus Rapid Transit to Silver Spring and expanded local service to and from Maple Lawn,  River Hill, and Downtown Columbia.  Improvements in demand-response mobility services may also be needed.   I also support the County Executive's recently proposed capital budget increases for bus shelter improvements and the Bike Howard program. However, bicycle usage would increase if more emphasis was placed on restricted (rather than shared use) bike lanes.  I also support better connections from Howard County to the rail systems in Baltimore and Washington with more frequent MARC service.   A balanced public transportation program includes roads and I support needed road resurfacing and planned projects for safety improvements and congestion relief in the MD 32, MD 175, MD 108, US 1 and US 40 corridors.","I do not support reducing the tax rate to the constant yield rate because, as reported by the Spending Affordability Committee, ""general fund revenues are expected to experience relatively weak growth in FY 2019 which will put additional pressure on the County to meet additional service needs and anticipated cost increases such as rising employee and retiree benefit costs"". The Committee adds that the County's service delivery capacity will be challenged by demographic trends such as an aging population and continued growth in school age population, as well as a shift in residential construction to multi-family housing.   At this time, I do not favor moving to Zero Based Budgeting (ZBB) and annually rebuilding the budget from scratch given its complexity and the time constraints of the budget cycle. I prefer the TRACK Howard approach which focuses on performance management with the goal of developing tight department missions, outcomes, and metrics. This should result in a budget that is better prioritized and aligned with programmatic and financial strategic plans - goals of ZBB. We are fortunate to have a strong Spending Affordability Committee process to provide advice on revenues and maintaining spending discipline for the operating and capital budgets. As a 30-year Howard County taxpayer, I understand the need for fiscal accountability, sound financial management, and a government that is constantly looking for ways to improve efficiency, workforce productivity, and program effectiveness.","What are your views on the use of tax-increment financing as an incentive for private building and redevelopment projects, including remodeling blighted village centers in Columbia?","With rising concern over school safety, should county police officers or sheriff’s deputies be assigned to all public schools, along with additional screening methods, such as metal detectors, student pat-downs and clear backpacks?",Are there any county government services that should be privatized to save money and improve efficiency?,Is a provision in the county’s recently adopted Adequate Public Facilities Ordinance that allows developers to build affordable housing in areas where a building moratorium is in place a responsible approach?,Is it appropriate for Howard to be a “sanctuary county” and prohibit county police from reporting detainees in the county detention center to federal authorities?,"What efforts, if any, should Howard County take to install more flood-control systems in and around Ellicott City, and how many tax dollars should be involved?",How would you respond to the opiod overdose epidemic?

A TIF is recommended if it can pass the ""but for"" test, i.e., ""But for this TIF, the land would not be developed"". I do not support the TIF for Downtown Columbia because it did not pass the ""but for"" test. Land in Downtown Columbia is highly sought after by developers and if Howard Hughes did not have the funds to develop their land then they should have sold it to a developer who did. Giving away $90 million dollars plus interest of taxpayer money to aid a developer who is having funding issues is not responsible representation of us or responsible stewardship of our tax dollars. We are now witnessing the issues that are surfacing surrounding this TIF (not being used for the parking garage and being used for roads) making it all the more obvious that this was the wrong thing to do. If the Village Centers can organically pass the ""but for"" test then I will be happy to review a TIF for them. Giving away tax dollars is not something I take lightly and all requests for funding will be thoroughly reviewed.","The safety of our children in school is the priority and the goal. For now, I support officers in schools to act as a deterrent and to be there for quick responses, if needed. I do not support pat-downs or clear back packs. I see the cost of metal detectors as a wasted expense as we can put that money to better use. Moving forward we need to use technology. We have ways to make our kids safer, and we have to do those things. I would like to see us employ some of the equipment used in what is praised as the safest school in America. Some of what they do is they have cameras with a direct feed to the police so the police know where the perpetrator is in the building, teachers wear panic buttons which sets off a school-wide alarm and notifies local law enforcement. Moreover, a device in each classroom allows for a teacher to tell law enforcement their classroom is safe or signal they need medical aid or ask for help if they've seen the perpetrator. Lastly, there are smoke cannons in hallways used to blind and disorient the perpetrator. The cost to implement these strategies in all Howard County schools is $40 million dollars. We have a $1.4 billion dollar budget and we can find $40 million dollars in that large budget. It will come down to priority.","Yes, there are ways we can save money on government services by furthering our partnerships with private sector non-profits and for-profit businesses.  There are over 200 different county and local government services that are privatized across the nation and if it is done right it can boost the efficiency and quality of remaining government activities, reduce taxes, and shrink the size of government.  I will explore our options for privatizing what makes sense for us to privatize here in Howard County as we have many places where we can use the money that will be saved.","No, it is not responsible. If the schools are overcrowded, they are overcrowded. If the services and roads are maxed out then the services and roads are maxed out. Whether or not new residents come from a market rate unit or a subsidized unit has no bearing on use of roads, services and schools. This is another game played by our elected officials against us in favor of developers.","Howard County is not a so-called ""sanctuary county"". This question fails to distinguish the difference between the role of the Howard County Police Department and the role of the Howard County Detention Center. The County Police has never reported illegal immigrants to the federal authorities and that is not their job. It is their job to respond to and investigate crimes or other calls for service regardless of the immigration status of the victim or suspects. The Detention Center's role is to house suspects that are charged with crimes or inmates sentenced for a crime. The Detention Center is not enrolled in the 287(g) program and does not actively report detainees to the federal authorities. However, they will abide by detainers lodged by the federal authorities for an inmate at the Detention Center. This strikes a balance between abiding by the laws of the federal government but also not actively seeking to have any inmate reported for immigration issues.","Since the flood great progress has been made.  94% of businesses have reopened, $1.5 million of grant funds have been distributed and 72% of displaced residents have returned.  An analysis of the flood yielded 18 recommended flood mitigation projects and 4 of the recommendations are being worked on currently.  They are the Tiber, New Cut Branch, Hudson Branch and the Frederick Road conveyance where the pipe will be enlarged and a sister pipe will be installed to move the water from the street.  There are 5 reasons why we had a flood.  1. Development and land stripping.  2. There are only 64 storm water ponds in the entire watershed. 3. There are pinch points in the streams where they hit culverts to go under the roads, at these pinch points the water jumped the streams and flowed down Main Street.  4. There was a failure at Burgess Mill where a sand trap blew out and the water flowed down the street.  5. Several inches of rain fell in a short time and mimicked a 100 year flood.  The objective for this variable is to use conveyances to take it down to a 10 year flood which is manageable and much less destructive.  The fixes must be a priority and we must pay close attention to approving development moving forward.  Additionally, we have to get every single federal grant and state grant we can for these mitigation projects and look to prioritizing our budget to ensure these projects get done.","Yes, we need to expedite a cutting edge treatment facility and we need to get funding from big pharma. Big pharma and their over prescribing doctors are the cause of this second heroin epidemic and they need to pay for it. Whatever it takes to make it happen and I will task our county attorneys to get to work on it. There will understandably be push back from certain communities about having these inpatient treatment facilities ""in their backyard"" but there are numerous areas throughout Howard County where an appropriate facility can be placed without interference with residential neighborhoods.","We have invested enough for the goals we set for ourselves some time ago however, the needs are changing and the goals need to change as well. We need bus lines that go within and throughout the entire county enabling all of our residents to reach all areas inside Howard County. We can ensure county residents are able to work at county businesses if they can reach their areas of employment by public transportation. The bus lines will need to run in a more timely fashion. Right now residents can wait up to an hour for a bus and cutting that down to 30 minutes or even 15 minutes between buses will be helpful and make using public transportation less cumbersome and useful on a daily basis. Waiting for an hour or more for a bus to arrive is not an efficient method of transportation on a daily basis for work.  The County Executive has begun to explore shorter wait times.  We can look to cities that have successful public transportation for ideas so we are not wasting time reinventing the wheel. Once we have a bus system that truly serves our needs and is inclusive of the entire county I think we will see better use of, more use of and the desired use of the BikeHoward program. As it stands now, many of us have to drive our cars to the bike stations.",I wholeheartedly support zero-based budgeting as I do not support the concept of growing government costs for the sake of growing government costs. Zero-based budgeting formulates a budget from scratch each year instead of basing it on what happened the previous year.  Right now we just continuously add year after year and never make cuts.  This will help us to lessen government waste as department heads will not have to adhere to the attitude of use it or lose it.  The constant yield tax rate will aid the state in reducing government cost as the revenue will remain constant and will force the state to prioritize spending while adhering to cost saving measures.,"What are your views on the use of tax-increment financing as an incentive for private building and redevelopment projects, including remodeling blighted village centers in Columbia?","With rising concern over school safety, should county police officers or sheriff’s deputies be assigned to all public schools, along with additional screening methods, such as metal detectors, student pat-downs and clear backpacks?",Are there any county government services that should be privatized to save money and improve efficiency?,Is a provision in the county’s recently adopted Adequate Public Facilities Ordinance that allows developers to build affordable housing in areas where a building moratorium is in place a responsible approach?,Is it appropriate for Howard to be a “sanctuary county” and prohibit county police from reporting detainees in the county detention center to federal authorities?,"What efforts, if any, should Howard County take to install more flood-control systems in and around Ellicott City, and how many tax dollars should be involved?",How would you respond to the opiod overdose epidemic?

There are a number of areas that have been particularly impacted by flooding, including Ellicott City, but also parts of Allview and others as well.

YES,SUSPENDED,howard-county/county-council,3,Gene Ryan,Ryan,05/16/1973,Columbia,Unaffiliated,In 1999 I received a MPH in Urban Health Administration from the University of Medicine and Dentistry of NJ where I also completed my training in the Advanced Life Support Practitioner Program. I then went on to complete an Advanced Trauma Management and Flight Medicine Subspecialty Fellowship at the New York Medical College- Westchester Medical Center. I am currently a Disaster Epidemiology Ph.D. candidate at the Naval Postgraduate School.,"As a public safety professional, I have served in many capacities. During college, while working for a police agency, I helped to negotiate the surrender of an armed hostage taker. I later managed a regional 911 communications center where I directed the emergency response to an attempted airliner bombing. During my tenure, I was awarded a Gubernatorial citation for my perseverance in uncovering a plan for mass poisoning. Currently, I work as a Sergeant for the Washington DC Fire and EMS Department with my four-legged german shepherd partner Kylie. Trained in explosive and human remains detection, Kylie works alongside me during natural and man-made disasters. Before my current role, I was responsible for evaluating and improving the provision of emergency medical services system-wide. As an elected member of my local board of education, I was responsible for managing millions of dollars in taxpayer revenue while ensuring high-quality public education. I was ultimately appointed to serve on the NJ Commission for Special Education where I championed the needs of our most vulnerable children. While serving as a municipal zoning official, I was proud of my accomplishments towards smart growth which included preserving hundreds of acres of green space at no cost to the community. As a member of the Howard County Alcohol Beverage Hearing Board, nominated by Councilwoman Jen Terrasa and approved by County Executive Kittleman, I have been able to increase economic opportunities while establishing a fundamental standard for public safety. My work on the current HCPSS Superintendent's Advisory Committee has helped create a strategic plan to identify and dismantle special education inequity within the Howard County Public School System.",https://electgeneryan.com,,,,"TIFs are intended to incentivize the development of areas where builder interest is limited. When used appropriately, TIFs can achieve a more significant benefit.  As an Independent, I hear the concerns of my community without first filtering it through a political boss. Creating an affordable Howard County means crafting a TIF policy which benefits everyone in our community.  Despite being the second most affluent county in Maryland, capital improvements have fallen decades behind. Part of this failure is because we continue to do things the way we always have. Primarily funding critical needs on the backs of taxpayers is unacceptable. This type of outdated funding approach will lead to a community where nobody can afford to live.  Revising APFO and zoning regulations means irresponsible development will stop. As a result, developers will need more variances to build. Leveraging those needs and partnering with developers, will achieve growth that benefits both builders and existing residents alike. Relationships like 3P reduce the cost of infrastructure improvements and create transparent accountability. Desperately needed schools can be built much quicker and at a fraction of the current price. TIFs can be used ultimately to reduce taxes and speed up overdue improvements.  My skill as a zoning board official, coupled with my experience in school construction and managing multi-million dollar budgets, demonstrates my ability to create innovative community solutions.  There is no room for on the job training when taxpayer money is at stake.  I understand developer relationships in terms other than campaign contributions.","Gun violence has been an epidemic long before Parkland and long before Columbine. Gun violence is everywhere; a nightclub in Florida, a movie theater in Colorado, a bible study in Texas. Such horrific violence represents the endpoint in a cascade of failures.   As a public safety servant for nearly two decades, I have worked on the streets in some of the most violent cities in Amerca. I have looked into the eyes of dead boys and girls who were shot and killed as they walked to the store, or waited for a bus, or played on a swingset.  While most people cite statistics and opinion, I offer real-world experience. One evening over three decades ago, I went out for Sunday dinner with my family. As I walked across the parking lot, a man pulled out a gun and began to shoot. I was 12 years old when a stranger tried to kill me because he was angry at the world.  If we expect police officers in schools to be the thing that keeps our children safe, we have failed miserably.  Early identification and intervention is the key. Working with children to help them understand better ways to solve problems, providing accessible psychological support, insisting on universal background checks for gun owners; by implementing these and other early intervention strategies, we will no longer need police in schools. However, until that time, communities must do what is necessary to keep kids safe.","My top priorities on day one include quality schools, public safety, and affordable living. While most candidates agree on these priorities, almost none have the experience to see it through. As an Independent, I will ignore the partisan noise that divides us, and I will find real solutions like I always have.   The simple reality is that government must be efficient and effective if we are to enjoy a community that is inclusive and affordable. Asking the hard questions and reviewing current practices will help to clarify the efficiency of Howard County government. Do we have clear policies for giving preference to Howard County residents and business owners when awarding government contracts? Do we use taxpayer funding as a last resort? What percentage of spending originates from grants and other sources like the casino impact fund?   School construction costs have increased 300% over a short period, and taxpayers have had to pick up the bill. We have accepted that truth and have only sought more state funding. There are better solutions for funding capital improvements. In some cases, privatization is a result of failing to innovate.  By reimagining how we spend taxpayer dollars, we can envision new ways to build partnerships and achieve more affordable projects. This form of fiscal management is not an all or nothing proposition. The question should not be county government versus private enterprise, but instead, it should be about how can we can work together to create best practices that benefit our entire community.","The recent APFO review process was protracted and lacked transparency at times. The failure of leadership to insist on openness and equity was alarming and will hopefully be a wake-up call about political party influence during this election cycle.  In 2017 Howard County had 41 homes available in the Moderate Income Housing Unit Program. In a county with over 300,000 residents stretching 200 square miles, only 41 MIHU homes were available for sale. The need for affordable housing is transparent.  APFO regulations help to limit overgrowth, but they also provide a statement on the historical failure of our partisan officials to meet the infrastructure needs of residents.  It would be irresponsible to allow traffic congestions to spiral or pack school children into unsafe trailers simply in the name of achieving more affordable housing units. Life in Howard County is about quality and not quantity. What kind of benefit do we provide to anyone when our community lacks appropriate flood controls, or adequate school buildings, or safe roadways?   As an Independent council person, my responsibility is to be an architect of noteworthy policy. My role is to protect the high standards which define Howard County. There is an urgency to get things done, and I will work with my fellow council members to develop pioneering solutions, just as I have done in the past.","Partisan fighting has resulted in fear-mongering and divisiveness within our community. As an Independent representative, I am committed to stopping this by working together to identify the things that connect us all. I believe equality is a fundamental human right without further qualification.  I do not support deputizing local law enforcement officers as federal immigration agents. I also do not advocate an end run around our national laws. Sovereign citizenry has no place in Howard County. Picking which rules we follow is not an option. Civility is our core value because we understand the way to unite people is through understanding.  Allowing local police to notify ICE before releasing a person targeted for deportation is reasonable. Immediate deportation applies to people with violent criminal convictions.  Our community deserves to understand how severing relations with ICE will impact us all. ICE is responsible not only for immigration, but also for human trafficking, pharmaceutical smuggling, and counterfeit product law enforcement.   One person dies every six days in Howard County by overdosing. ICE is one of the federal agencies tasked with stopping the opioid epidemic. Declaring Howard County a sanctuary county will jeopardize support from federal law enforcement and will compromise our efforts to prevent needless deaths.  MS-13 is a multinational terror organization responsible for human sex trafficking and is located right here in Maryland. Refusing to work with ICE means we compromise our ability to protect young girls and stop human trafficking.","County leaders have the ultimate responsibility to keep Howard County residents safe. Historically, elected officials have focused on after the fact disaster relief, and have not prioritized infrastructure improvements to prevent catastrophes. Growth in Howard County has been allowed to outpace critical capital improvements.   During my decades of catastrophe response experience, I have traveled around the world to save lives following disasters. Nearly all of the tragedies share a single commonality; the loss of life was preventable.   Taxpayer money, even when used responsibly, sometimes doesn't stretch far enough. Recognizing that problem, I founded a nonprofit public charity which directly supports local first responders and has delivered thousands of dollars in training scholarships and disaster response equipment to local departments. Our organization focuses on reducing risk through proactive preparation.   The Howard County Hazard Identification and Risk Assesment report identifies flooding as the highest risk natural disaster threat facing our community. Nearly 75% of Howard County lies within the Patuxent watershed. Major population centers such as Ellicott City, Elkridge, and Allview are all in low-lying areas. Howard County has an increased likelihood of future flooding due to our aging dams.  I support a threat assessment plan that prioritizes critical infrastructure improvements. I do not recommend a wait and see approach. Historically, I have collaborated with agencies such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to achieve substantial improvements. Using my knowledge of modern funding and nonpartisan solutions will help minimize the need for local tax dollars.","Overdose deaths claim one life every six days in Howard County. Nonfatal overdoses occur nearly once per day. While there is little debate that our community is in crisis, there is much debate about what has caused the problem and how best to move forward.  I support a strategy focused on providing meaningful relief. Howard County currently has the 4th highest number of drug and alcohol rehabilitation facilities out of all counties in Maryland. During the course of my career providing pre-hospital advanced life support, I have resuscitated thousands of overdose victims, some more than once. Addiction can be a complicated issue involving both medicine and psychiatry.   I fully support a research-based best practices approach for addressing this epidemic. However, I am not aware of a needs assessment which justifies the construction of a taxpayer-funded inpatient drug treatment facility. Millions of tax dollars should not be spent so that we can say we did something. The actions we take to address this challenge must be meaningful and based on a comprehensive plan.    Being a real leader means making the hard and sometimes unpopular decisions. How best to address addiction is one of those hard decisions. Howard County residents deserve more than political pandering and unfulfilled promises. This is the time for serious people with real experience and commitment to chart a course forward. As a councilman, I will bring the skills, knowledge, and abilities necessary to help this community navigate our next best steps forward together.","Ensuring that Howard County has a high-quality multimodal transportation system is key to the quality of life we all want.   The Columbia Association (CA) currently maintains 95 miles of walking, jogging and biking pathways in Howard County. I am deeply troubled by the Association's recent proposal to reduce services and eliminate the majority of neighborhood centers. I am even more concerned with the lack of transparency and openness surrounding the announcement.  As an Independent,  I can find ways to build relationships without partisan politicals. CA is our partner in maintaining core elements of the Howard County infrastructure.  As the District 3 councilperson, I will identify the challenges facing CA and help find solutions that preserve our community's access to vital assets. Instead of focusing on the things that divide us, I will work to identify those things which connect us all.  The coordinated efforts of citizen advisory groups have helped to identify best practices for transportation within our County. Two weeks ago, the County Executive transmitted a priority project letter to the Maryland Department of Transportation detailing 25 different priority transportation projects for Howard County, including the expansion of mass transit, physical street improvements, and the upgrading and creation of bike paths.       Working with the Maryland Department of Transportation will allow Howard County to improve infrastructure without raising taxes. I support initiatives that will enable residents to participate meaningfully in the future of Howard County and use local taxpayer dollars as a last resort.","Growing up in a small middle-class town, my parents ingrained in me the core value of living within one's means. As a father to four young children, I want to provide my family with the best of everything. Living within my means has meant finding creative ways to accomplish my goal.    When I was hired to evaluate the quality of government services in DC, I found rampant dysfunction which was not only wasting taxpayer dollars but in some cases, was costing people their lives. Instead of keeping quiet and collecting a good salary, I stood up to powerful political appointees and blew the whistle on corruption, waste, and fraud. As a result, taxpayer funding went back to where it was intended, and the community learned to trust public servants again.   Confronting waste and mismanagement took a significant toll on me personally and professionally. Doing the right thing can be very unpopular in politics. Speaking out almost bankrupted me and the heartache it caused my family will last a lifetime. Despite all of the ugliness, I would do it again because the needs of those I serve will always come before those of my own.   As the custodian of taxpayer dollars, our elected leaders must be skilled at minimizing expenses while delivering high quality of government services. I support methodology which rewards responsible government by reducing taxation. Setting a predetermined tax base without understanding the actual cost of services creates false expectations and can potentially over or underfund government.","What are your views on the use of tax-increment financing as an incentive for private building and redevelopment projects, including remodeling blighted village centers in Columbia?","With rising concern over school safety, should county police officers or sheriff’s deputies be assigned to all public schools, along with additional screening methods, such as metal detectors, student pat-downs and clear backpacks?",Are there any county government services that should be privatized to save money and improve efficiency?,Is a provision in the county’s recently adopted Adequate Public Facilities Ordinance that allows developers to build affordable housing in areas where a building moratorium is in place a responsible approach?,Is it appropriate for Howard to be a “sanctuary county” and prohibit county police from reporting detainees in the county detention center to federal authorities?,"What efforts, if any, should Howard County take to install more flood-control systems in and around Ellicott City, and how many tax dollars should be involved?",How would you respond to the opiod overdose epidemic?

I have also served the citizens for 10 years on the Board of Education. I am passionate about serving the community. My experience and leadership on the Board of Education have provided me the experience to be an effective Council Women for District 4 and maintain our quality of life and to provide the services needed by the people.",http://www.janetsiddiqui.com,siddiquijanet,,http://surveygizmoresponseuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/fileuploads/296249/4299893/95-699040ea16d788f8600f70ab8e55cdaa_Janet_main_photo.jpg,"Using tax-increment financing in vibrant and thriving cities that are already attractive to developers is hard to justify and, in most cases, is not in the best interest for the community. While it is supposed to increase tax revenues from business and housing, that may not transpire for many years, if at all. If we are going to subsidize business development, then we should invest in minority and women owned businesses.  Research shows that investing in minority owned business has a larger impact on the community through job creation, income, and tax revenues. We are living in a minority-majority county and attention must be placed on the growth of a younger multiracial population.","School safety must be our top priority. There is no argument that every citizen wants the safety and security for themselves, their loved ones, and their neighbors. Our students need to feel safe in school and not threatened or scared by teachers with guns, metal detectors or pat downs. At the time of the Sandy Hook shooting, as a member of the Board of Education I immediately reached out to the County Executive and Superintendent to find ways to secure our schools. As a result, the board moved forward with investing in security measures at the entrances to all of the elementary schools.  We should consider increasing police patrols within school communities, however the implementation and process of establishing security measures needs to involve the community for their input with an open and transparent conversation involving all stakeholders; students, parents, teachers, staff, police and school system officials to come up with the best methods to ensure a safe learning environment for our children.","Outsourcing does not necessarily improve efficiency or save money. Privatization erodes transparency and accountability. Only if there is a centralized government office to manage and oversee operations, contracts, and vender selection, can you consider such an option. Supporting local businesses will cut costs and put the tax payer money back into community. All procurements, both public and private should include priority for minority-owned, women-owned, and locally-owned businesses. Looking for ways to cut costs should not be done at the expense of county workers. Howard County government and community has a talented and professional workforce. Professional development and training is a way to save money and increase efficiency, and unionized workforces will help to assure safe working environments.","Only a small percentage of a developer's project is typically set aside for affordable housing. The entire development moving forward puts a burden on the school system with overcrowding of schools, roads and infrastructure. If higher fees are imposed, the developers may pass those on to the home buyer. We have to be firm in our decisions to reduce overcrowding in our schools while balancing any housing growth in the county. There needs to be expansion of rehabilitating existing housing throughout the county with grants and partnerships to increase the stock of affordable housing units. The county needs to continue to find ways to support affordable housing for our senior citizens, veterans, disabled, and homeless populations. Having supportive community housing for those with greater needs forms a foundation of care and trust, helping those most vulnerable.","We are a nation of immigrants and it is a human right to feel safe in the community and not fear bias and retaliation based on your nation of origin, color of your skin, race, gender, language preference, or socioeconomic status. People living in fear of retaliation are at risk of isolation, poverty,  lack of healthcare and food insecurity. It was James Rouse's vision for Columbia to promote unity and the growth of its people. When you invest in people and bring them out of poverty, you get a hard-working community that gives back.","Inadequate infrastructure and drainage of the communities than surround the tributaries contribute to flooding in low line areas, and while some measures were taken in the past, it could not compete with mother nature in 2016.  Preservation of this historic area is important for the county. The state, county, and public/private partnership needs to develop a structural engineering solution to the flooding in this region with shared costs for short and long-term solutions.","As physician working at Johns Hopkins for 23 years, I have been taking care of families and understand the toll that drug addiction takes on the family and community.  This problem of epidemic proportion is impacting our county residents. We urgently need an inpatient and outpatient treatment facility that provides supportive treatment options. The facility should be staffed with high quality physicians, nurses, psychologists with expertise in drug treatment and mental health issues with the latest therapies and interventions. Pain treatment programs, Naloxone access and educations programs for patients, families and healthcare workers are opportunities to intervene. Mental health care is also a crisis in our community.  We need of high quality healthcare access for all with  more inpatient and outpatient mental health facilities, for prevention and treatment of depression and anxiety in our children and adults.  Currently there is a lack of psychiatric beds in the community for children and adults. I support the addition for the inpatient psychiatric unit at the Hospital.  I look forward to working with our local health department, local hospital and physicians and community in addressing this problem.","Investing in our public transportation system is beneficial for people and the environment. It helps those with disabilities and senior citizens, while preventing social isolation and fostering independent living. It's also an opportunity to combat climate change. We need to improve regional service within Columbia, as well as to other areas of the county including service to our major employers. I would also like to work with the county and state to look at a mass transit project between Anne Arundel County near NSA /Fort Meade and Howard County. Our bus stops should to be connected with safe walkways, accessible and ADA compliant and weather friendly bus stops. Additionally, safe biking and walking paths are needed to connect communities and parks.",The constant yield property tax level is in place for county residents and maintains stability for those on fixed incomes. Local officials should still have the authority to adjust the property tax rate up or down based on the projected revenues for the year and give the public advanced notice with the opportunity to hear from constituents. I will support a citizen task force to explore different opportunities for tax revenues to support the county budget.  Vital services to the county must not be put at risk by zero based budgeting. Certain county departments may benefit from zero-based budgeting for one-time costs or specific programs or projects.,"What are your views on the use of tax-increment financing as an incentive for private building and redevelopment projects, including remodeling blighted village centers in Columbia?","With rising concern over school safety, should county police officers or sheriff’s deputies be assigned to all public schools, along with additional screening methods, such as metal detectors, student pat-downs and clear backpacks?",Are there any county government services that should be privatized to save money and improve efficiency?,Is a provision in the county’s recently adopted Adequate Public Facilities Ordinance that allows developers to build affordable housing in areas where a building moratorium is in place a responsible approach?,Is it appropriate for Howard to be a “sanctuary county” and prohibit county police from reporting detainees in the county detention center to federal authorities?,"What efforts, if any, should Howard County take to install more flood-control systems in and around Ellicott City, and how many tax dollars should be involved?",How would you respond to the opiod overdose epidemic?

,YES,howard-county/county-council,1,"Elizabeth ""Liz"" Walsh",Walsh,5/17/1971,Ellicott City,Democratic,"I am a Mount Hebron Viking, Class of '89—just in time to be part of Hebron's first-ever girls' lacrosse team. My undergraduate degree is in Civil Engineering. I attended Georgia Tech on scholarship, as a National Merit Scholar, and graduated with honors in 1993. In 1997, I went back to school, to become a lawyer. I graduated from Georgetown Law, also with honors, in 2000. I am the product of public schools, many, many of them. I am an Army brat. Patapsco Middle School—where I landed in eighth grade—was my sixth since kindergarten. (Go ahead and ask my Dad about German preschool before that, I dare you.) When it came time to raise my own family, I booked it straight back to Ellicott City, to where my Mom and Dad still live in the house behind the old Enchanted Forest, to the town and the schools my younger sisters and brother grew up in. So that my kids would have a physical permanence, a longevity that hadn't been part of my own childhood. I didn't know then, what I do now, that even in our tightest-knit neighborhoods, especially in District 1, our kids are just as likely to get moved in and out of schools, separated from friends and neighbors and trusted educators, just as much as I was. My own babies are now 8 and 5. This County's very youngest constituents are why I'm in this race.","For nearly twenty years now, I am a construction lawyer. I draft and negotiate contracts to design, build and manage construction projects. I advise general contractors and project owners as to what their contracts say, what the law says, and what that means they can and probably shouldn't do. Depending on what's at hand, I can be a collaborative problem-solver dedicated to preserving long-standing business relationships, or I can be the fiercest advocate. Before law school and over summers in college, I was a project engineer for a national general contractor. I bid and ran construction projects in the field. Wearing a hard hat. Shooting grades. Tracking spreadsheets and schedules inside the hottest or the coldest trailer in the world (depending on the season). And there was definitely a prickly, wicked-smart superintendent always leaning over my desk. If all my projects had been like my last one—rebuilding an old-time swinging bridge over the Cedar Creek in Slaughter Beach, Delaware—I probably never would have applied to law school. From this hard, hard work, I learned pragmatism, efficiency and an insistence on concrete and timely deliverables. This professional background will serve our County well: as local government undertakes a comprehensive re-working of its land-use laws and zoning plan, and as Developers continue to pursue Council approval to veer from them. I know the law. I read the plans. I do the math. (My first job ever? The Sizzler on Route 40, where the Burger King is now.)",http://www.walshforone.com,,walshforone,http://surveygizmoresponseuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/fileuploads/296249/4299893/44-eaf1d59c5426c918229332495a5b0120_Walshheadshot-4.jpg,"Tax increment financing (TIF) is a government subsidy of private development. Speculating that a given development project will produce future, enhanced tax revenues in excess of the costs of extended financing, local government will pay some portion of a private project's upfront development and construction costs. Although not without risk, when used to incentivize development of a project or an area that is languishing and would not otherwise attract private investment, TIFs probably make sense.  Conversely, TIFs don't make sense when private development would have happened and would have generated the same enhanced tax revenue—without any government subsidy. In that case, annual County revenues are depleted dollar-for-dollar as the unnecessary debt incurred is repaid over future decades, and the County capacity to finance other capital projects—like new schools, like school renovations and school additions—is lost. The $90M TIF awarded to a NYSE-traded Developer (and donor to District 1's incumbent Council member) in 2017, as part of its re-development of downtown Columbia was a TIF that did not make sense.  In any case, if local government is going to dole out public funds to private interest in the form of a TIF, the exchange must be plainly documented: these public funds will be used for this public good or service, on these specific terms, within this finite timeline. Private interests' use of the public funds must be transparent, closely monitored and, if not compliant, rescindable. None of this happened with the Columbia TIF.","I promise this: As District 1's elected Council member I will approach every issue from this very same perspective: what do our children—every one of them—need.  For them to be safe, to feel safe, is paramount.  The question is whether putting more guns, school resource officers, and/or law enforcement in Howard County schools is a better safeguard and spend than enhancing existing  physical building security (monitoring and call systems and security doors), getting kids and teachers out of the County's 224 portable classrooms, or hiring more teachers and counselors. I can't believe it is, but would generally defer to the wishes of the students, their parents and educators and the Board of Education on a whole school-by-school basis.","I would be more supportive of privatizing consumer-oriented services that aren't already being provided  (like  a more robust public transportation network, or compost collection and processing (on M1 or M2 land!). I would expect, generally, to oppose privatizing any public assets (like parks, recreational and other open space, museums and other historical buildings). Particularly with regard to a new county courthouse, I would rather that the delivery and operation of that new public asset not be undertaken as a public-private-partnership.  Lighting-as-a-service or solar panels, to me, promise the most potential for the County to achieve both savings and improved efficiency across the array of County-owned buildings, including schools. Service providers design and outfit existing buildings and spaces with new energy efficient systems; the resulting savings in electric usage thereafter is shared between service provider and consumer; even with such additional obligation owed the service provider, the consumer ends up paying less money and using less energy than under its prior, traditional energy-use portfolio.","The Adequate Public Facilities Ordinance (APFO) is a land-use policy intended to ensure that new residential construction does not outpace the public facilities (roadways and schools) available for its use.  After extensive ""task force"" consideration of potential APFO revisions, months' delay following introduction of the resulting compromise bill (CB61-2017), and then several late-into-the-night public hearings where constituents testified overwhelmingly in favor of tighter development controls, in November 2017 the current County Council finally passed the compromise APFO revisions. Its vote was invalidated the next day, however, having taken place two days after the bill had expired by procedural rule.  In February 2018, the Council passed another APFO bill (CB1-2018)—albeit in weaker form than had passed just three months before.  As revised, APFO imposes no ""building moratorium."" In the event a high school reaches 115% capacity, a middle school 110%, or an elementary school 105%, the law only delays the start of new construction.  After waiting four years, Developers can build into County schools regardless of how overcrowded those schools may be.  District 1's incumbent voted against other members' proposed amendments to both APFO bills, that would have lowered constraining capacities or extended the applicable waiting period. Worse, he provided the swing vote allowing an exemption new to the second APFO bill: projects providing at least 40% affordable housing would be permitted to build into overcrowded schools without any waiting period at all. This APFO revision set no limit on the number of homes so exempted, or the resulting school-age children.","I wish that providing all our County residents ""sanctuary"" from discrimination, intimidation and fear would not be taken as denigrating the lawful immigration processes that certain among us have so painstakingly honored. Plainly last year's so-called sanctuary bill (CB-9) did not come about in a vacuum, but rather in response to federal law and policy that on its face and in its implementation targets with laser-focus only certain countries of origin and one religion. By our silence, we are complicit in his hate. By our failure to affirmatively reject it, we embolden his bigotry. And it seeps and spreads into settings and circumstances and personal interactions wholly apart from federal immigration and customs enforcement. That any child or family, particularly, would be or feel vulnerable for our failure to stand together--loudly, resolutely, as a unified community--is unconscionable to me.  What is neither solution nor satisfying is quietly publishing sanctuary-like policy (OPS-10) months after the fact. Either definitive, decisive action is required or it is not. For me, this is not an issue for middling or compromise.","Mostly, the County must comprehensively plan for and manage the pace and extent of new subdivisions, infill development and other gray infrastructure permitted in this grossly overstressed watershed. But, plenty of no-cost measures would better control flooding in old Ellicott City and the established neighborhoods that surround it. At a minimum, the County should:  --Disallow development plans on the shelf to ""grandfather in"" under superseded, woefully inadequate storm water management and conservation regulations --Enforce existing land-use law, forbidding the County's Developer-cozy Department of Planning and Zoning from continuing to waive environmental requirements even in the most sensitive applications --Enact better laws, prioritizing green infrastructure, wider buffers protecting natural streams and manmade waterways, and forest conservation, and    --Stop paving everything. Since the July 2016 flood, the County continues ad hoc installation of even more impervious surfaces in the immediate area of old Ellicott City: a new public parking lot at the base of Fels Lane, another proposed near the District Courthouse complex of existing lots, an extensive asphalt landing and berm at the bottom of Park Drive…    Additionally, we must identify those upstream existing properties where storm water mitigation will have the most meaningful impact on downstream homes and businesses, opportunities along the Tiber and Hudson rivers to expand the surrounding flood plain, and ecologically significant undeveloped areas we should ensure remain green.    I am generally in favor of more robust storm water facilities as outlined in the latest draft recovery plans.","I will serve all of my constituents in all of their needs. If I hear from them or otherwise independently determine that the existing level of treatment and services provided addicts in Howard County is insufficient or in decline, I will work collaboratively with the County Executive, fellow Council members, local and state agencies and the network of non-profits in and around the County providing recovery services, to determine the fastest and best remedy.","We don't invest enough in public transportation. Last year, for example, Montgomery County spent nearly $25 per person on its bike network. Anne Arundel spent $13.20. In Howard, though, we dedicated only $1.89 per person to implement the existing County-wide plan to connect neighborhoods and towns and make bike ridership an effective alternative to vehicular traffic. Fully funding the BikeHoward program would require $3 million dollars annually, not the fraction of that spent this prior year. As an alternative or supplement to pulling those funds from County revenue, we should ensure that new development is contributing on-site bike-related amenities consistent with the BikeHoward program.  One particular infrastructure item that should be prioritized given its certain effectiveness in safely connecting otherwise isolated neighborhoods is a pedestrian/bicycle bridge over Route 1, in Elkridge. Given the speeds on that roadway, and its width, crossing it on foot or bike is too dangerous, particularly for children.  Allowing safe passage from one side of Route 1 to the other will link neighborhoods and parklands on one side, with new recreational facilities, a library and senior center and schools on the other.","If we can afford it, I am all for reducing the tax rate to the constant yield level. Right now, though, while our schools are digging out of an anomalous, but sizable operating deficit, I don't think we should.","What are your views on the use of tax-increment financing as an incentive for private building and redevelopment projects, including remodeling blighted village centers in Columbia?","With rising concern over school safety, should county police officers or sheriff’s deputies be assigned to all public schools, along with additional screening methods, such as metal detectors, student pat-downs and clear backpacks?",Are there any county government services that should be privatized to save money and improve efficiency?,Is a provision in the county’s recently adopted Adequate Public Facilities Ordinance that allows developers to build affordable housing in areas where a building moratorium is in place a responsible approach?,Is it appropriate for Howard to be a “sanctuary county” and prohibit county police from reporting detainees in the county detention center to federal authorities?,"What efforts, if any, should Howard County take to install more flood-control systems in and around Ellicott City, and how many tax dollars should be involved?",How would you respond to the opiod overdose epidemic?

I believe TIFs give an unfair competitive advantage to the favored developer compared to another developer on whom the County did not bestow a TIF.","A trained law enforcement officer should regularly be present in every school.  In addition, we should use best available technology practices, including reinforced glass and doors, communications systems, alarms, security cameras that can be monitored by police (both remotely and on-site), and other features designed to stop an attacker in their tracks.  I have proposed setting up a charitable foundation to which tax-deductible contributions (not subject to the recently added cap on state and local taxes) could be made to fund these improvements.  The estimated cost for installing this program in every Howard County school would be approximately $40 million.  My proposal could be fully implemented with an average contribution of $80 per year for five years by each household in Howard County.","Much of our public transit system is under-utilized, and our public transit system cannot efficiently serve residents who live off the beaten path or in more rural areas.  The County should explore using private contractors to fill these gaps in a cost-effective manner.","No.  This provision, although well-meaning, could end up being the exception that swallows the rule.  I supported the recent revisions to the Adequate Public Facilities Ordinance for the most part, although this amendment as well as some other provisions should be re-visited by the next Council.","Absolutely not.  No county nor state should have its own foreign policy, and the whole concept of state nullification of federal laws was resolved with the Civil War.  Moreover, some of the beneficiaries of such sanctuary legislation are involved in trans-national gang activity and human trafficking, and prey primarily on otherwise law-abiding undocumented immigrants.  I fail to see the public policy reason for protecting such criminals.  None of the advocates of the sanctuary legislation proposed in 2017 could cite any problems with how the County was treating undocumented immigrants.","I believe the current administration has done a good job of addressing the issue, and identifying problems areas,  I will wait until the total costs of flood-control are known before opining further.","As an emergency first step, all first responders should be equipped with naxalone (i.e., Narcan or Evzio).  Only one hospital is located in Howard County, but Howard County residents are also served by at least six other nearby hospitals outside the County.  It would be better for the experts in the health care field to evaluate the need for an in-patient drug treatment center rather than just starting throwing money at a problem so that we can feel better about ""doing something"".","The County has invested plenty, although much of the money could be spent better.  Residing in western Howard County, I see many roads favored by cyclists that are hazardous areas just waiting for accidents to happen.  Where feasible, I would like to see bike lanes installed  (particularly on upgrades) on certain roads to separate bicycle and motor vehicle traffic.","Yes.

According to the Government Finance Officers Association, TIF's are employed in almost every state and most medium to large municipalities. I believe that with the slower rate of fiscal growth that Howard County is experiencing and projecting in future fiscal years, the County must consider a full array of financial tools like TIFs, P3s, and others. TIFs should also not be viewed in a vacuum.  It is important for us to look at the long-term revenue benefits from financing infrastructure.  In the case of Downtown Columbia, the County Council decided in 2010 that it wanted a highly dense commercial and residential region in Columbia.  That desire would not have been achieved without the use of public financing. The County Council decided in 2016 to utilize this tool and did so in a way that will yield hundreds of millions of additional tax revenue coming into the county to support its public service needs over the next 30 years.  I voted in support of the TIF for Downtown Columbia.  As a result of public concerns about changes to the TIF for Downtown Columbia, I sponsored a measure that the Council passed 5-0 to have language included in future TIF-enabling legislation that requires additional Council review and public input on significant changes to any TIF-funded projects.","I believe we need to put a priority on making our schools as safe as possible and that all measures and methods should be considered. Following the Parkland massacre, I attended a meeting with students at Wilde Lake High School, along with Senator Ben Cardin, to discuss their thoughts on school safety. The students raised a wide variety of physical security measure, including ""active shooter"" drills, screening at the entrances, more enhanced identification and building access procedures, and more. I support Howard County Police Department's excellent Student Resource Officer (SRO) program now at all high schools and some middle schools, and expanding it to all high schools AND middle schools. Further, with additional community input, I believe formalizing regular community police patrols to include public schools is another means of improving school security. While some police officers already visit some schools as part of their regular patrol routine, making this part of the standard operating procedure will provide police with greater awareness of the environment and physical layout in the school, something best done before a crisis occurs.  One concern raised during this discussion, as well as other conversations I've had with students, parents, educators, and public safety leaders is how far do we go before our schools become more like fortresses than places of learning. Our community's challenge will be to find the right balance of safety and an inviting educational environment for our students.","At this time, there are no specific services that I would identify that are appropriate for the Howard County government to privatize.","I co-sponsored and voted for APFO (CB1-2018). The core of the legislation came from amendments I authored or co-sponsored, including lowering the elementary and middle school capacity tests, adding a high school test, and strengthening the roads test. My goal was to create the strongest possible bill that could be enacted; requiring either four votes on the Council (a ""veto-proof"" majority) or three Council votes and the signature of the County Executive. The affordable housing provision included in APFO is a responsible approach to addressing the lack of such housing. The provision itself does not add or approve a single unit in areas that are ""closed"" to development; allowing affordable housing projects only when a specific set of conditions are met:   1.  At least 40% affordable at 60% or less of the area median income, and the project includes or is seeking low-income tax credits or other state or federal financing; 2.  Led by or in partnership with a local nonprofit or the Housing Commission; 3.  Supported, in writing, by the County Executive; and 4.  The Council and Executive approve a resolution following public hearing and input. Specifically, considering the capacity of the schools impacted by the project, number of students the project may generate, potential BOE actions to address capacity, and the need for affordable housing in the county.  This provision addresses the County's need for affordable housing and concerns related to compliance with the federal Fair Housing Act that Maryland and other jurisdictions have experienced when restricting development.","I believe many concerns about the current climate within our immigrant community have been addressed through the implementation of several actions I worked diligently in partnership with people and organizations in our community - HCPD, County Administration, Foreign-Born Information Referral Network (FIRN), HopeWorks, #OneHoward, and Indivisible HoCo. A few results of these efforts include:  1.   Comprehensive review and update of county policies to determine opportunities to clarify interactions with the foreign-born community. 2.  A new and comprehensive HCPD policy (OPS10) documenting interactions with foreign nationals. I believe this is one of the more comprehensive policies in the region. 3.   MOU between FIRN and HCPD to enhance trust, communication, and engagement between HCPD and the County's foreign-born community. FIRN has reported that since the policy and MOU have gone into effect, they're seeing increased willingness among the immigrant community to report crimes.   4.  Increased public access via the County website and from organizations assisting in disseminating relevant information.   I believe the outcomes outlined above have provided more real and practical support to our immigrant community than passing a symbolic sanctuary resolution or law. As a result, I do not believe Howard Count needs to be a sanctuary county. A member of the Indivisible Immigration Action Team remarked that my ""position on immigration since early 2016 and our recent encounters lead me, personally, to believe that in many ways your approach maybe what is best for all residents of Howard County given what is and is not occurring at a national level.""","I have been deeply involved with addressing stormwater and flooding in Historic Ellicott City going back to before being elected when I was a Main Street business owner and one of the founding members of the Ellicott City Partnership. As the Councilman representing this area, here are a few examples of action to protect the area:  1.  Launched, with the County Executive, the Ellicott City Flood Working Group in 2015 to establish a vision and plan for managing storm water in the area. 2.  Authored CB79-2016 (passed 5-0) to increase requirements (for first time in over 10 years) for stormwater management to the ""100-year storm"" level for the entire county. The bill also requires these regulations be updated regularly. 3. Authored CB80-2016 prohibiting issuance of waivers to floodplain, wetland, stream, or steep slope regulations for properties in the Tiber Branch Watershed. 4. Worked closely with state and federal officials for funding and support for flood recovery and rebuilding efforts.   The proposed FY19 Capital Budget contains approximately $5 million in funding for high-priority, high impact flood and stormwater projects. That is a good start and I'll continue to push for more for all sources. The larger projects have much larger costs, so the County needs to find innovative ways to fund and build projects that will yield measurable reductions in the flow of storm water through this area. Further, I support investigating joint projects with the state, federal government, and private sector that can deliver improvements to flooding throughout the area.","The opioid epidemic requires a multi-faceted approach to address the impact in Howard County. The medical community, perhaps motivated by changes in federal or state law, should seek minimize the use of opiods in treating patients, except where truly necessary. Further, with the expansion of medical marijuana in Maryland, there's another treatment option for medical professionals. Studies have shown that states with access to medical marijuana have lower rates of opioid additions.   Improved efforts on public awareness on opioid use, addiction, and treatment is another facet to the County's response. Coordination and collaboration among key players within the government, non-profit, and medical communities can help to stem the rising tide over overdoses. This could include public training and access on the use of antidotes like Naloxone. Again, state and federal support for such programs and in purchasing antidotes are critical to local jurisdictions addressing the epidemic.   Lastly, the construction of an in-patient drug treatment center should proceed as quickly as the process and funding allow. The size and scale of such a facility is not likely to be able to meet the immediate demand, so the County needs to play a role in coordinating collaboration access to treatment for our resident in the county and the region.","As a Councilman, I have supported the County's efforts to improve an antiquated bus network by approving new bus purchase, including hybrids, and providing input on new routes based largely on input from my constituents. The County's Transit Development Plan has set a process in motion to routinely review bus routes and to make adjustments, as necessary, in a more proactive manner.   In addition to promoting improved bus access for residents, I have also supported the addition of bike and pedestrian lanes on many county roads in response to desires expressed by communities across the county. In instances where the inclusion of bike lanes had the potential to compromise the safety and convenience of certain communities and used my influence to prompt further examination and adjustment of the county's plans. This has led to more thoughtful approaches to integrating bike and pedestrian accessways into the county's road network.   I am proud of my vote as a Councilman to pass the Bike Master Plan, and I followed that vote with my support for the nearly 50 miles of bike infrastructure that will be built in the county over the next three years. I am in the process of evaluating the County Executive's FY19 budget for bicycle infrastructure. I have learned a great deal about multi-modal transportation as a Councilman and believe the knowledge I have gained positions me to view subsequent transit and road projects and plans in a complete streets mindset that blends sound transportation policy with community needs.","I support additional tax setting flexibility offered to local jurisdictions through a constant yield model the State is proposing, but I would only commit to honoring the lower rate if it meant that the public services that residents have come to expect are not compromised. As state leaders weigh the benefits of allowing jurisdictions to set a constant yield tax rate, I would encourage them to view this policy question from both the revenue and expenditure side. Maryland's population continues to grow, and the cost of services to facilitate a healthy and growing economy must keep pace with revenue. If that revenue is reduced because of a new tax plan, the County Executive and Council have the responsibility to develop alternative strategies to fund unforeseen needs and account for increase in the cost of service, particularly with respect to education and public safety.   I don't believe zero-based budgeting would benefit Howard County with many areas where there are required spending levels, particularly K-12 education. As a Councilman, I have voted on three balanced budgets that were built ""traditionally"" by the County Administration while evaluated and adjusted by the Council. A zero-based budget process would require county agencies to essentially start from scratch annually, which has the potential to compromise this creativity and distract us from appropriately analyzing funding alterations to existing county services. I do not feel that changing the county's budgeting approach will improve our ability to pass a balanced budget while funding vital services at the required level.","What are your views on the use of tax-increment financing as an incentive for private building and redevelopment projects, including remodeling blighted village centers in Columbia?","With rising concern over school safety, should county police officers or sheriff’s deputies be assigned to all public schools, along with additional screening methods, such as metal detectors, student pat-downs and clear backpacks?",Are there any county government services that should be privatized to save money and improve efficiency?,Is a provision in the county’s recently adopted Adequate Public Facilities Ordinance that allows developers to build affordable housing in areas where a building moratorium is in place a responsible approach?,Is it appropriate for Howard to be a “sanctuary county” and prohibit county police from reporting detainees in the county detention center to federal authorities?,"What efforts, if any, should Howard County take to install more flood-control systems in and around Ellicott City, and how many tax dollars should be involved?",How would you respond to the opiod overdose epidemic?

Columbia is not an inner-ring suburb and high-density, mixed-use development will put pressure on an already maxed-out infrastructure that lacks adequate public transportation, roadways, and school capacity.  Public financing should not be used to urbanize a suburban grid. The TIF plan also lacked the comprehensive financial analysis to determine if it was truly necessary and would yield projected revenue.","I have elementary-aged children and I do not want their schools to become guarded fortresses. The buildings  need to be safe (locked doors, emergency preparedness plans). But schools need to be welcoming places where children grow and learn and any safety measures need to have a  child-centric perspective. The best tool for identifying and engaging with isolated and potentially violent students is to have small class sizes. Schools need to have the staffing and the resources to be proactive with students with mental health issues. We also need common sense gun reforms at the state level.","Privatization as a principle for reducing budgets is often a short-term fix with long-term financial consequences. In cases where services are already outsourced, it is vital for the county government to have an effective oversight department that conducts accurate cost-benefit analyses, monitors costs and quality, and ensures transparency and due diligence. Outsourcing can not be done without these oversights.","I view this provision as a loophole for developers to circumvent the lowered school capacity thresholds instead of an attempt to address affordable housing issues in the county. I think it significantly weakened APFO's ability to control growth. Moving forward, the provision needs to be careful scrutinized to determine if it achieved its stated goals.",I support the current policy that the police will cooperate with ICE only in criminal matters.,"Flood controls should be a combination of public investment, growth management, and incentives. The county should invest in stormwater-management improvements in  flood-prone areas, such as Old Ellicott City, Valley Mede, and Dunloggin. The county should also consider flooding and stormwater management in all zoning matters and add a related test to APFO, like neighboring counties. As older retail centers are redeveloped, reducing impervious surfaces should be a design requirement.",The epidemic requires a multilevel approach from public education and public health services to legal action. HC Drug Free works tirelessly to educate the public on the risks of opioid addiction and outreach programs to dispose of unused prescriptions. Public health and safety workers should have access and training in administering naloxone.  Howard County needs to keep a deliberate path on plans for a residential detox treatment center that would provide wraparound services to address addiction issues after an overdose. The county's decision to participate in a class-action lawsuit against drug manufactures will help pay for the public health costs related to the epidemic.,"There is never enough investment in public projects, including the trickiest of them all,  transportation. The county needs to do a better job linking workers and career-training students to job centers efficiently and affordably. The county also needs to reorient the services to include the needs of an aging population. The transit system should also consider integrating technological trends of ride-sharing to provide more flexible service in under-served areas. Replacing the system's aging fleet is also an additional resource concern that could be addressed through ride-sharing models. The BikeHoward Express plan is a positive step towards expanding bike networks in the county and should be just the first step in alternative transportation investment.","Currently Howard County's constant yield property tax rate is $0.9910 per $100 assessment and its real property rate is $1.014 per $100 assessment. The County Council has entered into the budget hearing sessions and will consider rates for FY2019. Considering the county's need for increased infrastructure and the Spending & Affordability's report that revenues will decline as the population grows older, it is advisable to maintain current real property rates. According to analysis by  Deloitte, zero-based budgeting in the public sector is not a cost-effective strategy because of the manpower requirements. The report suggests less labor-intensive methods to achieve the goals of greater transparency, cooperation, and realignment .","What are your views on the use of tax-increment financing as an incentive for private building and redevelopment projects, including remodeling blighted village centers in Columbia?","With rising concern over school safety, should county police officers or sheriff’s deputies be assigned to all public schools, along with additional screening methods, such as metal detectors, student pat-downs and clear backpacks?",Are there any county government services that should be privatized to save money and improve efficiency?,Is a provision in the county’s recently adopted Adequate Public Facilities Ordinance that allows developers to build affordable housing in areas where a building moratorium is in place a responsible approach?,Is it appropriate for Howard to be a “sanctuary county” and prohibit county police from reporting detainees in the county detention center to federal authorities?,"What efforts, if any, should Howard County take to install more flood-control systems in and around Ellicott City, and how many tax dollars should be involved?",How would you respond to the opiod overdose epidemic?
