This recession dynamically changed the compensation of our teachers. Salaries became stagnated as our teachers sacrificed their own families financial stability to keep our schools open and our students receiving good quality education. The recession is now over. We must recognize that our teachers are our most important classroom resource. Our mutual goal must be to invest in our teachers' compensation. The County has been willing to work with AACPS on pressing issues such as stabilizing the pension fund and health insurance. We must now come together to better compensate our teachers as well as provide a more competitive compensation package to ensure we are able to not just retain the educators we have, but hire more teachers to reduce our student to teacher ratios in our classrooms. We have decided to make an investment in new schools to reduce school population sizes; we must approach classroom sizes with the same vigor and intent.","Here is an opportunity to make changes now to mitigate the deficiencies that exist and simultaneously work towards a larger, enterprise level solution. Several categories of change should be instituted. Although the subcategories are many, I would like to cite a few examples: 1. Facility changes: Modern, double entry door systems and a reassessment of secondary ingress and egress points. Re-evaluate travel points between public entrances and the security check in point 2. SoftwareTechnology: There are apps recently released that can create a school community group that allows anyone to report an intruder or active shooter as it occurs and will automatically notify public safety, locate that person no matter where they are on campus and then alert the larger school community so everyone can take immediate action. 3. Hardware Technology: New monitoring and other integrated notification system devises. Upgrade our wi-fi and cellular coverage in the schools so communication can be instant and efficient. 4. Prevention and response training. Everyone should be equipped to respond to an incident 5. Mental Health Investment: Additional staff and access to continuing education for our teachers on this critical issue. 6. Public safety investments: Our County Council each year limits the # of police and mobile crisis we can add to the force in the interest of other budget priorities, SROs and our mobile crisis team needs more personnel and training resources. Our regular police force needs adequately staffed, as they are just as important to security.","Bullying has been and continues to be a challenge for schools across the nation. Bullying is targeted mental and sometimes physical abuse of another person. Almost all children who bully are externalizing their own insecurities and are often unable to cope with negative emotions. They are in need of mental health services At the same time, one in every 20 families face extreme challenges coping with opiod addiction of a loved one. That means at least one student in each classroom goes home to addiction. There is a connection. Bullying can be responded to when it occurs and we must always be evaluating our policies of conduct to ensure we have ample restitution to the victim and correction measures that hopefully discourage future bullying behavior. That is not enough. We must work to prevent it from occuring in the first place. The first step is to create a healthy environment for our students. Mental health is just as relevant to our students health as their physical well being. As one of the moderators and team member of the Not My Child Opiod Prevention Team, I have been in our schools, churches, community centers and businesses, sharing information and strategies with an ultimate goal of No New Users. What that experience has taught me is we do not have adequate mental health services in our schools. School mental health resources are underfunded.

I firmly believe that retention strategies are the most cost-effective means of achieving that goal. I have met with numerous teachers of the past several months and know that many of them feel gravely undervalued, especially those that stuck it out and could earn more by moving to another school system. It is demoralizing for these teachers to train newly hired teachers with a similar level of education and experience who are earning a higher salary. The cost of turnover both financially and to the quality of education we can offer our students is greater than doing what is necessary to retain our experienced and effective teachers. I am aware that over the last decade, the AACPS budget for non-teaching positions has increased at three times the rate of spending on teachers. I believe this misguided practice has been detrimental to our students in multiple ways, and I believe we need to refocus our budget back into the classroom. Hiring and retaining quality teachers has to be our number one priority. Our board and administration has to create a budget that reflects this goal and work with our County Executive and County Council to ensure we have the resources necessary to offer the best possible education to every student, regardless of zip code or other factors affecting a student's opportunity to succeed.","If at all possible, once we have ensured that every school has the same quality safeguards already in place in many of our schools, I would like to see that money spent on sufficient staffing within our schools with teachers, guidance counselors, and psychologists. If these funds are restricted to what might be considered more concrete security measures, then these funds could be used to add to enhancing and updating current security equipment and school resource officers. It is important though that these officers are seen as security for the students and not policing of the students. These officers need to have opportunities to regularly interact with students in a way that the students feel safe and see them as a support. It is important that we not overestimate and therefore overreact to the real threat to our students to the point that we are making rash decisions that will serve to put our students in even greater danger. Turning our schools into prison-like fortresses could have detrimental effects on both the student and adult population as was reported a few weeks ago in ""Education Week."" School will become even more of a place where students don't feel safe, rather a place they expect violence. This will also create a divide between teachers and students as students are seen as potential threats rather than young citizens to develop and nurture into productive citizens. The psychological effects here are potentially much more costly than the benefits of peace of mind.","After attending a Board of Education meeting and witnessing over an hour of public testimony from parents and students on this issue, I was left feeling disturbed and very concerned about how these cases are being handled. I began researching and attending other public forums, and most recently sat down with a parent who has become a leader in this movement to have our schools deal with bullying of students by fellow students and even teachers. The process for the handling of reports and resolving these cases seems to be deeply flawed. It is a very complicated issue with many factors serving as a barrier to the protection of our students, but we must methodically and systematically come up with concrete solutions that will not leave the onus on the victim to find a solution to ending their ongoing torment. I believe our board should create a commission made up of parents, students, administrators, guidance counselors, law enforcement, and the Department of Health to come up with policies and means of enforcement that will ensure that every student feels safe and supported in our schools. There is no choice but to move forward with finding effective solutions and not just point to current codes of conduct that are not being followed or enforced. It is heartbreaking to know how our school system has let down these young victims of emotional and physical violence.

Those strategies should include hiring an adequate number of counselors, psychologist, and other mental health professionals; reducing teacher-student and student-counselor ratios, implementing school-wide violence prevention programs, and implementing an anonymous reporting system.","The board should address bullying by taking seriously all reports of bullying or harassing behaviors and they should work to quickly to address those violations.

Other strategies include training for students, teachers, and staff on how to appropriately recognize and respond to reports of bullying or incidents. Efforts should be made to promote effective preventive and intervention approaches such as counseling and support services.

The COLA increases are important because they also increase the starting salary for our new teachers.

In order to be competitive in recruiting new teachers, we must raise that beginning salary to match or better the counties around us.","I want to see a School Resource Officer (SRO) in every high and middle school. While SROs provide additional physical protection. just as or perhaps even more so, they become a vital and trusted member of a school community.

The SRO relationship carries over into the community as increased trust and cooperation with law enforcement. We are renovating our schools to have double check in points at the entryway.

Annual salaries found in surrounding school districts are considerably higher, causing low teacher morale as well as retention problems at every school level. One veteran teacher mentioned that she and her colleagues feel devalued and demoralized by not receiving these missed steps, especially knowing some less experienced teachers are paid more. It is highly disruptive to children in any grade when their teacher leaves, someone with whom a strong bond has been formed. Problems with teacher retention are also potentially devastating for high school students who are applying to colleges and universities and need college recommendations. One example illustrating this growing problem occurred at Annapolis HS when a very experienced and talented AP Psychology teacher left his 11th and 12th grade students mid-year in favor of a better paying out-of-state job. Additionally, Annapolis HS's much adored Language Department Chair also left for a job in a nearby county before some of her students had the chance to ask for college letters of recommendation and left Spanish students with a series of substitutes, some of whom couldn't speak Spanish. AACPS should provide all its teachers, substitutes, secretaries, and staff with salaries and working conditions equal to their counterparts in surrounding counties. Retention efforts preserve the wealth of knowledge and experience of our veteran teachers and costs far less than recruitment, especially because Maryland is a net importer of teachers.","Full-time School Resource Officers (SROs) must be assigned to more schools. SROs provide needed school security as well as serving as positive role models and mentors to students. Staff also benefit from their SRO's depth of training and experience in handling difficult or potentially dangerous situations. Although there may be greater need for SRO presence at middle and high schools, as we've seen with the Sandy Hook tragedy, I believe that eventually all schools, including every elementary school, requires an exclusive and full-time SRO. Additionally, all schools must be upgraded with video monitoring systems along with a double set of locked doors at main entrances and upgraded classroom locks. These physical barriers can potentially prevent, or limit the scope, of dangerous incidents. Beyond securing school and classroom entrances, hiring the recommended number of mental health staff must be a priority. Children do not become a threat to themselves or others overnight. I firmly believe that many tragedies could have been prevented if these children were better supported from an earlier age, and warning signs were taken seriously and handled appropriately. Currently, AACPS lacks the number of school counselors, school psychologists, social workers, and pupil personnel workers to meet student needs. The current number of school counselors is far below the American School Counselor Association (ASCA) recommendation ratio of 1 counselor to 250 students, with most school counselors currently supporting more than 700 students.","Benjamin Franklin was once quoted as saying, ""An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."" This quote is still true today. Solving bullying isn't just about punitive consequences, but also involves mitigating against the root causes. Shifting the AACPS culture towards one of prevention and finding sustainable solutions rather than reaction will yield better results and stop the cycle. Supplementary curriculum focused on tolerance, inclusion, boundaries, safe behavior, and treating others how we'd like to be treated should be required and implemented at every grade level starting with kindergarten. Culturally Responsive Teaching pedagogy can also be used as means of including our diverse student body, especially marginalized and underserved populations. Expanding mental health services, including hiring more school counselors, school psychologists, social workers, and pupil personnel workers, to staff-student ratios recommended by the ASCA and the National Association of School Psychologists is also critical to supporting both bullying victims and their perpetrators. Both bullying victims and perpetrators should be evaluated by mental health services staff and, if necessary, should involve parents and additional agencies. Likewise, teachers and staff require additional regular training on bullying, its causes, identifying instances before they become dangerous, and most importantly to take all student reports seriously and cease from categorizing any instances of bullying as minor. While the existing code of conduct should be in place and followed consistently, preventative measures can change the overall school culture towards one of tolerance and inclusion.",The Teachers Association of Anne Arundel County continues to advocate for a return of step increases given up during the 2008 recession.
