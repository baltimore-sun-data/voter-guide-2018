,YES,anne-arundel-county/county-executive,Steuart Pittman,Pittman,9/11/1961,Davidsonville,Democratic,I graduated from University of Chicago in 1984 with a BA in Political Science.,"I have 33 years' experience managing nonprofit organizations and small businesses. I worked as a community organizer empowering citizens to influence local government, a farmer and re-trainer of racehorses for second careers, and director of a national non-profit called Retired Racehorse Project.",http://www.PittmanForPeople.com,http://facebook.com/PittmanForPeople,Steuart_Pittman,http://surveygizmoresponseuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/fileuploads/296249/4299923/52-093691c6ae7287260925493912f9adab_cropped-empty_background.jpg,"County Executive Schuh came into office with a pledge to spur growth. He did so with taxpayer-funded incentives and little regard for the development plan we had in place. The accelerated growth has stressed our schools, traffic flow, and county services. My administration will conduct an audit of the development projects that have been approved in recent years. It will track consistency with the growth plans approved by our elected officials and weigh the fees and taxes generated from each project against the costs borne by taxpayers. The county has managed growth and budgets in a way that created a long-term fiscal mess, and to dig ourselves out we need to understand how we got here. We will invite residents in each of the county's 16 Small Area Plan communities to update the recommendations they made in existing plans. That information will be combined with findings of the development audit and input from the business community to create a plan for the county that is fiscally responsible, environmentally responsible, and sustainable for future generations. Developers and the business community need consistent rules that are applied fairly. The plan that we approve will create opportunities for development projects that have community support, and we will facilitate the transparency and communication that makes the process work efficiently. We can't turn back the clock on growth, but we can take stock of where we are today and give our residents a voice in where we go from here.","Counties are ground zero in the national war on opioid addiction. With over 1,000 overdoses and 155 deaths last year, there is no room for parochialism, politics, or blame. Service providers look to county government to coordinate efforts and fill the gaps in education, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, and law enforcement. It starts with the doctors who prescribe the opioids. Thanks to Maryland's new Prescription Drug Monitoring Program and lawsuits against doctors who abuse their licenses, opioid prescriptions are decreasing. Our police must continue to track down and arrest the heroin dealers. It's the only way to keep the deadly fentanyl-laced drugs out of the hands of users. These arrests save lives. Opening police and fire stations as safe places for people to seek treatment sends a strong signal that local government will help. It also connects neighborhoods to information about treatment options. The greatest challenge is our shortage of treatment centers. We have Hope House at Crownsville Hospital Center, where talk of eviction by the state of Maryland threatens the future of the facility, and we have Maryland House Detox about to open in Linthicum, despite assessment by the county of a large development impact fee for rehabilitation of an existing building. We must embrace these and other facilities in our communities. As of April 10, just ten days after the first quarter of this year, our county had suffered 52 opioid deaths. These were our neighbors, co-workers, and sometimes our families. Every life we save is a triumph.","Anne Arundel County needs to invest more in education and public safety. Our neighboring counties offer higher pay to their teachers, firefighters, and police, making recruitment and retention here very difficult. That's why we are 400 teachers, 100 police officers, and some 50 firefighters short of recommended levels. Fortunately, we are in a good economy and county revenues are growing. When we end giveaways that provide no public benefit, like the $36 million property tax break for Live! Casino Hotel, our bottom line will improve. I believe that we can meet our needs with projected revenues, but I will never make budget promises before seeing the numbers and hearing from taxpayers. County voters in 2016 passed a charter amendment mandating that they have input into their budget. It was opposed by my opponent, but I supported and will abide by it. Our county has a property tax revenue cap limiting the increase in what we collect to the rate of inflation, regardless of growth in our tax base. As property values increase, our rate drops. Politicians like to take credit for that cut, but they shouldn't. When my budget team presents options, I will share them with taxpayers. If the economy falters, we will meet budget challenges as a community. If we need to make cuts or we need to boost revenues, we will make those decision after a robust debate in which all sides are heard.",How would you as county executive address concerns about growth and development in Anne Arundel County?,What is the role of county government in addressing the growing number of opioid overdoses and opioid abuse?,"Do you support maximizing revenue under the county tax cap, or seeking additional revenues to support increased spending on education, public safety or other initiatives?",Development,Opioids,Revenue
,YES,anne-arundel-county/county-executive,Steve Schuh,Schuh,7/25/1960,Gibson Island,Republican,"I have a Bachelor of Arts in Political Science and Economics from Dartmouth College, a MBA from Harvard University, and a Masters of Science in Education from Johns Hopkins University.","I am a small business owner in Anne Arundel County, former financial services professional and State Delegate, and have served as Anne Arundel County Executive since 2014. I am a lifelong Maryland resident and have lived, worked or operated a business in almost every part of Anne Arundel County. I have a deep understanding of every part of the County and have an immense appreciation for what a special place our County is. I raised my family here and understand the challenges that young families face in this community. I have also started and grown businesses here and understand how local government can make it easier or harder to create economic opportunity and jobs. I have now served for 11 years in elected office representing the citizens of Anne Arundel County and have always done my best to put people before politics.",http://www.steveschuh.com,http://facebook.com/Schuh2014,electsteveschuh,http://surveygizmoresponseuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/fileuploads/296249/4299923/52-d50a5454e7d2f1aa36ae8f48e7869dcd_schuh-portrait-sq_CMYK_300dpi.jpg,"Managing our lands is one of County Government's most important duties. I am dedicated to an open and transparent process as we begin our once-in-a-decade General Development Plan. I am committed to citizen input and engagement, as well as smart growth strategies that guide development to areas with adequate infrastructure and to protecting our rural lands. I support the current mix of 51% rural/protected and 49% developed/developable land. As County Executive, I recently proposed legislation that would impose a moratorium on up-zoning, tighten up the permitting process and re-establish small area planning.","County Government must take an active and aggressive approach to combating opioid abuse and use whatever tools are available to slow and stop this epidemic. We must educate all members of our community about the dangers of opioids and addiction, commit human financial resources to support prevention and treatment programs, we must adjust our laws to protect victims, and we must utilize our legal system to hold those who perpetuate this epidemic accountable. As County Executive, combatting opioid abuse has been my top priority, and our Administration has engaged government agencies, law enforcement and the public, private and non-profit sectors to form partnerships and devise creative solutions to this epidemic. There is not a single solution. Our Administration's ""Not My Child"" Program has been a tremendous success in educating parents about the dangers of opioids and has become a model for the State and Country. Our Safe Stations program has been utilized by hundreds of citizens looking to take the first steps to recovery, and additional Crisis Team members have been hired to respond to the increase in demand. We are taking a hard stance against pill mill doctors and have filed a lawsuit against opioid manufactures and over-prescribers to hold them accountable for their role in this epidemic. Fighting this crisis will remain my top priority for the next four years, and I will continue to work with our partners to put pressure on all levels of this epidemic and to expand our prevention efforts and access to treatment.","I support the County's property tax revenue cap. I believe government at all levels costs too much. By better managing the money we have and making County government more efficient, we can improve County services without raising taxes and placing additional financial burdens on working families. In the past three years, our Administration has instituted the largest tax cut and the largest fee cut in County history, reduced or eliminated seven taxes, and enacted cumulatively more than $67 million in tax and fee relief. While doing so, we have simultaneously launched the largest school construction effort in County history and have implemented three years of pay increases for teachers. We have budgeted three straight years of record education funding and have bailed out the nearly-bankrupt teacher health benefits program. Our Administration also launched the largest public safety infrastructure program in County history with construction of a new police academy and a new central booking facility, purchase of 550 new police vehicles, development of four new fire stations and purchase of 10 new fire suppression vehicles. In addition, we have also increased police and fire pay by 10% over the last three years and have added 80 new public safety positions to combat heroin and gangs. We have also launched a major crack down on MS-13 and have proposed a $15 million school safety initiative.",How would you as county executive address concerns about growth and development in Anne Arundel County?,What is the role of county government in addressing the growing number of opioid overdoses and opioid abuse?,"Do you support maximizing revenue under the county tax cap, or seeking additional revenues to support increased spending on education, public safety or other initiatives?",Development,Opioids,Revenue
