This administration has had a rougher go of it because of the choice to distance itself from establishment institutional knowledge from previous Republican administrations. Economic decisions have been mostly positive except for the latest omnibus spending bill. On foreign policy, the administration has taken stronger approach towards foreign actors who do not share American national interests, so far that policy pivot has worked well with North Korea and China.","I support the tax cuts. To date, more American have seen an increase in their take home income which has allowed them to become more active consumers in the marketplace. The 1st quarter 2018 GDP growth is projected between 2.5 and 2.8% which is moving in a healthy direction.","I believe we should put in place a balanced budget amendment which will begin to reduce the deficit. Decades of spending more than we take in has led increasing budget deficits which has accumulated in a national debt of $20.85 trillion. While it is nominal for a nation state to have a debt, we must be prudent with our ratio of spending to revenue, so our economy keeps growing while keeping our financial sovereignty secure.","I do not think it is within the government's purview to redistribute resources to make everyone equal. Instead, government should make sure people have the equality of opportunity by reducing regulations and the allowing individuals to succeed rather than through programs which provide subsistence. I am in favor of entitlement reform. While there is a need for a safety net, too many people have accepted living on government assistance as a lifestyle, not as a limited helping hand. I do not believe the phrase ""promote the general welfare"" means the government should subsidize individual personal expenses through domestic discretionary funding. To me, this leads to subsistence and dependence.","No. I believe the 2nd Amendment is a crucial freedom for citizens to retain a Republic. First and foremost, owning a weapon allows law abiding citizens to protect their property. There are too many laws restricting law abiding citizens from owning weapons. Criminals can get the guns they want no matter what laws are on the books.","The Affordable Care Act should be abolished. The national government does not have the authority to mandate health insurance. The 9th and 10th amendments to the Constitution leaves that responsibilities to the states. If states want to provide that service to their citizens, I am fine with that decision on a state by state case.","Providing opportunities for economic growth through expansion of enterprise zones. More funding to small and minority owned businesses. A common sense housing policy which rewards home ownership and community development. A community development project which would rehabilitate older housing stack and tear down structurally unsound and abandoned houses. Getting out of the business of mandating school curricula standards such as Common Core, Race To The Top and No Child Left Behind.","Congress should provide resources to the states to develop substance abuse programs. The Congress, through its control over trade, should tighten international shipping requirements of opioids coming from China and across the Mexican border.","Sanctuary Cities – I am against Sanctuary Cites. I think they are unconstitutional because cities do not have sovereignty; only the 50 states and the national government has that authority. In addition, not only do these cities have increased crime and gang activity, they also economically hurt the most vulnerable of our citizens – low skilled and inadequately educated people living in urban areas. There should not be a pathway to Citizenship. A possible solution may be a work / residency status which would be subject to taxation.",I want our country to put together bi-lateral fair-trade deals. Countries who do not respect our political will are the ones who take advantage of free trade policies.,Iran is a rogue actor and should be treated as a threat to American interests regionally in the Middle East and around the world. Every tool should be considered to make sure the Iran regime follows through on its promises.,"North Korea is also a rogue actor and has shown itself to not care about diplomacy and nice talk. North Korea understands force and the threat of action. In the case of North Korea, it is best to mean what you say and be prepared to back it up. Showing resolve and strength is a vehicle to earn respect. North Korea has been bullying its Asian neighbors for decades; North Korea now sees a President who is not afraid to confront bullies.",How do you assess the Trump administration so far?,Do you support or oppose the federal tax cuts passed in 2017?

He is a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and also is a member of the Environment & Public Works and Finance committees. From 1987-2006, Ben Cardin represented Maryland's Third Congressional District in the U.S. House of Representatives, including 17 years on the Ways & Means Committee. He was a member of the Maryland House of Delegates from 1967-1986. During his time as Speaker from 1979-1986, he reformed Maryland's property tax system, the school financing formula and the ethical standards for elected officials. After receiving his law degree, he actively practiced law until elected to the U.S. House of Representatives.","Donald Trump has shown over and over again that he doesn't have the temperament to be president or act ""presidential."" He doesn't have an understanding of how important his words are. He doesn't listen to advice and he has little aptitude for strategy unless it benefits himself personally. He continuously puts his own self-interest before the needs and national security of our country. He has repeatedly, intentionally misrepresented facts and events. His decision on day one not to transfer his business assets into a blind trust violated a fundamental protection in the constitution.","Oppose. This tax bill is not good for our economy and is bad for middle-income families. Former self-proclaimed deficit hawks allowed this immense amount of debt to be added to our nation's economy, meaning our grandchildren will be paying the interest on the interest for what was borrowed to pay for this permanent tax cut for corporations. At its heart, this bill was targeted toward large corporations and wealthier individuals. The provisions aimed at small businesses and working families were, by comparison, small and temporary. I am concerned that this bill will only widen the gap between wealthy Americans and middle- or low-income Americans. This tax law also is an attack on states like Maryland. Many Marylanders will come out much worse under this bill. In addition, the cap on the deductibility of state and local taxes is going to make it more challenging for state and local governments to meet their needs, the primary functions of which are to keep our communities safe and educate our children.","Yes, it is a grave concern. For example, in their recent tax bill, the Republicans added over $1 trillion to our national debt. This cannot continue. It will not grow our economy. Debt reduction cannot be a one-sided equation. We need to invest in places like infrastructure and education, which foster job creation and an educated workforce. While we need to prioritize spending, protecting programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid will be my priority. We cannot simply take a hatchet to programs. For example, improving the way we deliver health care (see answer to question 11) can slow down the rate of growth of mandatory health spending, helping us to reduce the deficit. The task of deficit reduction is not going to be easy, but we need a bipartisan commitment to control spending – both discretionary and mandatory – and have necessary revenues to control the deficit and, over time, balance the budget.","Yes. According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the rate of millionaires in this country grew five times as fast as the general U.S. population during the period of 1983-2016. There are now more than 9 million households with a net worth over $1 million. While it is positive that more families are succeeding, it overlaps with data from the Pew Research Center and others that show middle-income families shrinking as they fall into lower income levels. America's middle class – middle income families – has always been at the heart of our economy. Congress must take concrete actions to address the growing issue of income inequality, ensuring that quality education, housing, and health care are available to all Americans. A family should be able to afford a college education for their children without going into debt. We must foster programs and investments that make it possible for anyone who wants to work to find the opportunities available with the wages and benefits that can support a family. We need to invest in skills training to match workers looking for jobs with employers struggling to fill millions of specific positions. There are still far too many hardworking Americans struggling paycheck to paycheck. We also need to help Americans better plan for retirement so that after years in the workforce, people can enjoy the fruits of their labor.","Yes. Gun safety laws work. The overwhelming majority of Americans support stronger gun laws, which includes responsible gun owners who care about the safety of their communities. The NRA should not control the outcome of this debate. I've listened to students across Maryland. They want to know they are safe in their schools and their neighborhoods. They are pleading with adults to act like adults and take action. We cannot wait for the cycle of violence to repeat again and again without making a change. At a minimum, we must close the loopholes so that EVERY gun purchase includes a completed background check. We also must renew the assault weapons ban – there is no reason for such weapons of war to be in civilian hands. And we must block efforts to arm our teachers – the solution to the problem of daily gun violence and school shootings is not to bring more weapons into our schools. I agree with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that we must devote more resources to mental health priorities to identify young people (and adults) who may be about to cause harm to themselves or others. Let's attack this problem from multiple directions. Inaction is not an option.","Health care is a human right and universal coverage is essential. We should have seamless quality health care, affordable to all, from prenatal to death. The Affordable Care Act put us on a path toward this goal, however, Republicans have done everything possible to sabotage markets and the system since it became operational. The president's actions to weaken the individual market and cut support and outreach programs for the ACA has hastened some problems. Increasing the affordability of health care and improving our health system should not be a partisan fight. Congress should continue its work to stabilize health insurance markets to ensure that every American has full coverage. Having health insurance coverage is not enough. It must be affordable, accessible, and the quality of covered benefits, including consumer protections for patients, cannot be compromised. Accessibility is essential. Far too many people across Maryland are unable to access the full range of care they need because of where they live. Federally funded community health centers – 17 across Maryland – help fill the gaps in our provider networks by coordinating primary and preventive services that promote reductions in health disparities for low-income individuals, racial and ethnic minorities, rural communities and other underserved populations. I have also supported legislation that would expand telehealth services, which makes it easier for patients to connect with their health care providers and helps cut costs for patients and providers.","I was born and raised in Baltimore. This is my home and I will do everything in my power to help it grow and succeed. Similar to the boost created by the Obama Administration, there should be an ongoing all-of-government approach to helping Baltimore. Bolstering public safety and law enforcement, including robust federal support for the current consent decree with the Baltimore City Police Department, is important, but will only succeed in the long-run if paired with economic development and job training. The federal government also should provide tax credits and additional resources for infrastructure projects that support both commercial and residential growth. The federal government must be an unwavering partner in providing access to affordable, quality housing and health care, including mental health care and support for combatting opioid addiction. Congress has a responsibility to adequately fund the Every Student Succeeds Act, which helps ensure that City Schools and other urban school systems nationwide have the resources they need to provide students with career opportunities in STEM education, adequate mental health supports, and investments to support our neediest students. The federal government has a responsibility to continue investing in programs that help foster job creation, help small businesses compete and grow, while still protecting and supporting our children, our seniors, clean air and clean water. The federal government has an important role to play in promoting public health and public safety. This is as essential in our cities – including Baltimore – as in rural and suburban areas.","Maryland is not immune from the American drug epidemic, particularly the prescription opioid misuse and heroin addiction that has spread throughout every corner of our country. It is a public health crisis and must be addressed with every available resource at all levels of government. Tackling this challenge should go beyond efforts of law enforcement and must include sufficient funding to improve access to evidence-based treatment centers, promote prevention education methods, and provide support for those in or seeking recovery. We must keep our promise of federal funding for state-led treatment, prevention and law enforcement, education and outreach programs. We must work with medical professionals to limit prescriptions of opioids and encourage alternate methods of pain management. We need to invest in innovative programs that have worked in Maryland, including peer services for those in need of care. Congress came together to secure $10 billion to fight this crisis in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. The omnibus spending bill dedicated $3.3 billion in additional funding to address mental health services and coordinate efforts across agencies. I am hopeful this funding will provide resources to state and local governments to raise education and awareness, bolster treatment programs and facilities, and ensure that safe overdose countering drugs like Naloxone are readily available at all times. Congress also made headway reversing President Trump's proposed 27% cut to America's global counter-narcotics efforts, which would have weakened our ability to work with international partners to stem the illegal flow of drugs entering our country.","I believe the Senate should again take up bipartisan, comprehensive immigration reform to fix our broken immigration system. Congress must pass legislation to permanently protect Dreamers who are in this country and have mostly known no other country but this one. We also must take up and pass legislation I have introduced with Senators Van Hollen and Feinstein to create a legal pathway to residency for Temporary Protect Status (TPS) recipients, who also only seek a better life for themselves and their families, enriching our country and all that it stands for in the process. I was in the Senate in 2013 when we passed comprehensive bipartisan immigration reform. I believe it is possible again. We should not be wasting money on a fruitless wall, but we can strengthen technology and other border security. We can create a fair pathway to citizenship for those living in the shadows. For public safety, we must continue to effectively screen all who enter our country. We also must fight back against the Trump proposal to slash legal immigration, break up families and mostly close America's doors to refugees. Turning away legitimate asylum seekers at the border, and requiring mandatory detention of families and children, will do nothing to make America safer.","We are in a global economy and American producers, manufacturers and farmers can compete if given a level playing field. We must engage in international trade, but it must be done right. Our free trade agreements and policies should be focused on providing enforceable protections related to workers' rights, human rights, and the environment, and addressing serious imbalances, including through currency manipulation and anti-corruption measures. Our global economy has seen significant changes since, for example, NAFTA was first negotiated. We are facing new and different challenges that affect our businesses and our workers at home. Our domestic industries are facing different threats, including challenges from other countries related to market access and innovation. Our trade agreements and our approach to trade should reflect these changes.","I ultimately did not support the US-Iran deal three years ago because I felt that the JCPOA legitimized Iran's nuclear program, leaving Iran with the option after 10 to 15 years to produce enough enriched fuel for a nuclear weapon in a short time. However, since it was enacted, I have made clear that my priority is to ensure that America is good for its word and that the government has all the necessary tools to implement the agreement to its fullest. Particularly since President Trump took office, I have been one of the leading voices in the Senate to keep the US-Iran deal intact, provided Iran is in compliance. I have also worked directly with the White House national security team to explore solutions to keep us in the agreement. We don't want the United States to be the one who walks away from preventing Iran from becoming a nuclear weapon state. We would be isolated, and we'd give strength particularly to Russia and China. That makes no sense at all. What we should be doing is enforcing sanctions against Iran for its non-nuclear violations, its ballistic missile tests, its support of terrorism, its human rights violations. Unfortunately, President Trump has failed to implement the sanctions on Iran passed overwhelmingly by Congress last July and has chosen a path that makes addressing all other elements of a comprehensive Iran policy more difficult by alienating our allies and making it more difficult for them to work with the U.S.","The only workable solution to resolving the North Korean nuclear crisis is through diplomatic negotiations. The use of force would have catastrophic consequences. Last year, I called for a ""diplomatic surge"" with regards to North Korea. The opposite of diplomacy-by-tweet, it would provide an opportunity for collaboration with China and our Japanese and South Korean allies, leading to a place where Pyongyang could verifiably halt its nuclear and ballistic missile testing and we initiate negotiations toward denuclearization. By concentrating on denuclearization, and not regime change, diplomacy can succeed.",How do you assess the Trump administration so far?,Do you support or oppose the federal tax cuts passed in 2017?

I raised my children in the public school system where they have all gone on to attend college in the State of Maryland.  I am a lifelong resident of this amazing state and know first hand where the needs are.,The Trump administration has put America first as promised.  By lowering taxes for all Americans he has put more money is everyone's pockets.  This includes everyone from the federal worker to the Mom and Pop businesses. He has brought back confidence in the small business and real estate market across the nation.   He has brought back manufacturing jobs placing America on the same playing fields as China and other countries. He has  strengthened our military and increased security including our borders.  The pro business position has lead to a huge increase in our stock market.  He has brought back jobs and lowered unemployment which is at an all time low.  He has fulfilled many of the promises he made on the campaign trail.  He is running America like a business and is concentrating on economic growth.  My assessment of the Trump administration is that he is truly a man of his word.  He is delivering on the promises he made in record time.,"I support the federal tax cuts passed in 2017.  The corporate tax cut has had an invest in America and Americans mindset.  It has brought back money that has been parked  overseas and it is being reinvested to expand businesses and create jobs.  I believe the cut in the corporate rate has had the trickle down effect of increasing salaries, personnel, benefits, and growth.  These tax cuts has enabled businesses to put less money out for taxes and more into expansion.  On the personal tax cuts the increase in money kept by Americans will allow more time with their families.  It will encourage investment in their savings, education and housing.  The personal tax cuts is putting more money in everyone's pockets.  As your United States Senator I will make sure that they remain low.","The level of the national debt is a huge concern.  For years America has had negative economic trade deals reducing the financial revenues with no reduction of cost, fees or tariffs paid.  The UN requires money to be paid, but it has not been being paid by all parties.  The imbalance of the money paid by some and not paid by others contributes to the problem.  We are on the road to a healthier economy with the changes in tariffs, renegotiation of trade deals and lowering of tariffs paid by the US will make the lowering of  the national debt easier.  For years we as a country have been on the short end of the stick when it comes to fair trade.","The level of economic inequality is a problem however this is not a federal government issue.  Inequality in any form is a problem, I am a father of four young woman.  I believe they should be paid the same as a male with the same job and skill set.","Federal gun laws should not be changed.  Our second amendment is not the problem it is our right. We always concentrate on the losses but 9-11 was carried out with box cutters and planes.  This horrific tragedy had losses that touched America at its core.  We are a nation that has lost touch with our community, neighbors, friends and family.  We have adopted a mindset of "" it isn't my business"", but it is.   We in the past picked up the phone if we noticed our neighbor or their child were doing something wrong or we had a question about.  We used to assess a situation and then address it or make a call for help.  We as a nation look the other way.  This needs to stop, we must reach out to build a community network which will eventually be a national network.  We have raised a generation of children who have no respect, consequences, accountability or purpose.  We need to address these gaps in society, family, and community to prevent these events from ever happening.",The Affordable Care Act should be scrapped.  It was designed to insure everyone and morphed into a government run never affordable healthcare program.  We need to go back to basics where companies and corporations supplied their companies healthcare.  What is going to make healthcare affordable for everyone who wants healthcare or wants to purchase healthcare.   I believe if the economy keeps going forward the companies will offer benefits again in lieu of the Government healthcare systems that is not working.,"Cities including  Baltimore need help, and needs to be accountable.  They receive a lot of money from the States and the federal government from our tax dollars.  This money is being misused and mishandled. Throwing federal money at a city that is wasting our tax dollars is useless.  Until we have new officials running the city on the budget that they were given, we are wasting time and money.  The citizens of Baltimore are the ones being punished,  they need to vote Republican and use their voices. The old tax tax spend spend days are over.  Baltimore is a beautiful city and the citizens and businesses in Baltimore deserve to have Baltimore great again. The violence in Baltimore including the murder rate and drugs need to be addressed.  America was built with immigrants and we love our diversity.  Sanctuary cities must end.  Let the immigrants come the right way, the legal way and live by the laws that make America great.  I would like to see our federal dollars spent on manufacturing, apprentice programs through the school system,  and working with companies to employ our youth on internship programs.  It will keep the youth off the street, learn skills and develop a sense of purpose and pride.  It will also reduce the crime rate. All major cities need to develop these kinds of programs to save their cities.","The drug and opioid epidemic starts in the family.   This includes drugs, mental illness, violence, and the lack Jesus Christ in the family.   End the war in Afghanistan and burn the poppy fields and it will end the opioids coming into the US.",Congress should enforce the laws on the books.  We have them and they are ignored.

I imagine however that it could do better by filling the leftover administration positions needed. Those positions are important in quantifying data throughout several interrelated spectrums across our economy. The President must assume that he can handle every office's overhead on his lonesome or leave it up to his twenty two administrative heads, impossible. Many of the holdovers in underlining positions under the twenty two are limited in their powers; nonetheless, the time they can be a holdover is limited. The Senate must confirm those individuals. Also; among their limitations, these inaction's are bound to cause turmoil. Because they're not confirmed, per se, their decisions can be challenged in court. Nevertheless the caseload is piling up. Voters are left to ask ""how much of importance is being overlooked?"" Whatever the politics be at play at that this point the American people are the ones to suffer the consequences of inaction. As far as doing fair may go, in my opinion alone, the American people must feel some sense of concern. Among the constant change-in/change-out of Trump appointees I believe voters must be feeling a bit of exhaustion. People want transparency and eligible dialog. I don't necessarily find a direct line of action, but more so the constant questioning of ""what's next"" is all the American people have at this point to ask. Voters don't want redirection or misdirection. They want a line of goals that are achievable and suit our future needs.","I do not support the TCJA entirely. We should bring back the AMT, raise the top tax bracket 3% and bring back the previous estate tax standard deduction with an exemption for farm properties. It's certain that the TCJA will add roughly $1.5T in additional debt over the next 10 years. It's a benefit for the overly wealthy and the middle class will face more debt due to the lack of federal assistance towards states, just like we're seeing in Maryland's trajectory. It's assumed that the government and our necessary democratic institutions can function solely through the breadth of added jobs. Even with a projected GDP average of 2.13% the economy would require nearer to 4.0% to offset the difference for the windfall the rich make out with. At that rate we would slide directly towards another boom-bust recession. Taking the brunt of the recession (07-09) and ongoing the middle class should be getting the benefit of the TCJA to pay down its personal debts, not borrowing more. If Congress cannot take a Keynesian model approach with the TCJA (nearly impossible to do) then our economy will lack several infrastructure needs. We're taking an austerity approach with the TCJA. However, if the overly wealthy became contractually obligated to fund important infrastructure needs, then Congress may very well find a remedy. I beg to differ. The Bush tax cuts lost 5 million jobs, most permanently; the TCJA will add just 339,000 permanent jobs. The TCJA is bad. End of story.","The level of our nation debt is a concern. What can be done to hinder its growth takes place in several parameters either by reducing discretionary spending, increase tax revenues, create efficiency in mandatory spending, hold back stimulus packages or a combination of some, addition, removal, or mixture of all. These by themselves, or in combination, would affect our need to borrow from foreign countries or increase bank allowances through the Federal Reserve. Increasing employment expands the breadth of taxable income. As such, economic growth spurs debt reduction. The federal government's spending goes hand in hand with GDP, acting as its own loner. It can spur growth with stimulus packages towards infrastructure or use private enterprise to create jobs. The hope is; that in a growing economy, wages will increase and people will pay off more personal debt, securing their own financial situation and, in return, affect the way government spends. Consumerism is the main driver of our economy, near to 70%. We may face a boomerang recession if we attempt Reaganomics without a progressive tax rate. We should set fair tax brackets and wages, close S & C corp. loopholes and focus on infrastructure spending. Our biggest frustration is what tax/spending policy fuels growth. Fiscal year 2027 predicts a budget surplus. We should focus on a Keynesian model now while the economy is in rebound. By the start of the next budget the wealthy will face a smaller tax burden with a booming economy stipend with a surplus.","Economic inequality has worsened just over the last few decades. With it involves several demographics--property value, job opportunity, business prospects, crime, wages--and none of them are always cut and dry explanations. Union Labor participation is down. Manufacturing and line work has shifted overseas. Illegal immigration increases over the decades have reduced opportunity and stagnated wages in trade work. Technology and automation has taken over. The federal government can take several steps to curb economic inequality: * legislate a minimum wage wealthy companies and corporations would fulfill * raise the standard deduction to $18k for single filers earning under $24k annually * legislate a standard deduction on overtime pay * keep small business taxes low & increase workplace incentives * compile entitlement programs into one Universal Basic Income * focus on reducing recidivism in the CJS & end for-profit state prison systems * legalize cannabis * decriminalize drugs * outlaw 'Pay-day loans' * outlaw 'Payroll check cashing' * increase grants and vouchers for summer camps or 'safe-space schools' (schools open during summer break) The best ability of the federal government to reduce economic inequality would be to start approaching systemic problems associated with economic inequality. The approach that can be taken is focusing on the predatory policies that mostly affect people of low economic strata. Nonetheless, Congress could start a special committee to directly oversee the best remedy for areas of low economic strata and implement an itinerary coupled with extra discretionary spending in the Housing and Urban Development bill.","Yes. Firearm violence reduction laws work. They're both proven in statistics and implementation. There's no need to enact another federal assault weapons ban, however, because the previous had no effect on firearm homicide rate. There was a decrease in mass shootings between 94-04, but correlation does not meet causation. Several ways to secure firearm safety and magnify firearm violence reduction is simple: * allow the ATF a centralized firearm database & implement a firearm licensing system -- this will reduce the prevalence of firearms used in street crime * require Federal Firearm Licensed dealers to vault & store their firearms -- this will reduce the prevalence of firearms used in street crime * enact mandatory minimum conviction periods on criminals in possession of an unlawful firearm -- this will reduce street violence * create a standard cool-off period on the purchase of all firearms -- this will reduce firearm suicide rates & 'passion crimes' * license and permit concealed carry holders without fallacious requirements * strengthen background checks w/licensing system * require person to person sales to follow background checks & licensing requirements * enact Red Flag legislation * raise high capacity magazine firearms and/or long rifle purchases to 21 w/exception to hunting or sporting permits","With respect to the Affordable Care Act we should amend the patient protection provisions and essential health benefits portions of it and couple it with a hybrid single payer & free market insurance system. The ACA provided a decent framework for an actual healthcare system; however, it was not a healthcare bill. It was insurance reform. Insurance coverage reform was needed, but the bill was over proportioned. A hybrid single payer & free market insurance system would require making CHIP & PACE permanently budgeted into our mandatory spending; allowing the Medicare trustees to negotiate drug prices; set the cost sharing reduction payments towards ambulatory care centers; and set federal co-payment threshold levels for working PCIP recipients that they would couple with their out of pocket insurance expenses. This system would be funded by keeping the 3.8% surtax on capital gains and dividends, and raising the FICA rate no more that 1%. With it allow insurance companies to compete across state lines and bundle insurance payments towards certain procedures and costs--which the CMS started testing under the ACA.","The role our federal government should play in any area similar to Baltimore is start acknowledging the wide array of proven obstacles and the time after time outplay of the systemic problems as they begin to arise. Situations in places like Baltimore didn't just arise recently. Many issues from gentrification all the way to various demographic changes can be well enough assessed and predicted from here on out. Remedy is often right around the corner. Places like Baltimore are ripe to spur development. That development can be started from basic roots within working class communities. More often than not, however, extra money in the pockets of residents can do more for poverty stricken areas than government. If a focus on Universal Basic Income can grow to fruition initially for poor households, The Dept. of Housing and Urban Development could widely improve the wealth of the working poor. 42% of the ""poor"" own their own home. The majority of the working poor don't necessarily lack basic amenities, they're not starving, and the majority don't lack some form of transportation. A UBI could be modified so that basic needs of poor households are covered yet, meanwhile, they're enabled to grow their own financial portfolio by investing in raising their property value. This spurs growth in several ways 1) small business; specifically trade work, benefits through employment; 2) neighboring property value rises; 3) crime reduces; 4) property value increases home buyers & increases property tax revenue; 5) local government efficiency is generated.",In order to address the opioid epidemic Congress could focus on legislation that would require a centralized pharmaceutical database in each state that would interconnect with all drug dispensaries. The implementation of a centralized prescription network could cause a dramatic reduction in inappropriately filled prescriptions for opioids. Congress could also enact legislation limiting the amount of opioids prescribed--in terms of quantity--over their intended duration or prescription refill/expiration date. Congress could also enact legislation that would require pharmaceutical companies to pay for and provide qualitative/quantitative drug tests to deter and identify drug abuse. A qualitative test tells you if a particular substance (analyte) is present in the specimen. A quantitative test tells you how much (the quantity) of an analyte is present.,"Congress should immediately grant amnesty to the 800,000 DACA-profile aliens. Also, it's possible to grant amnesty though a pathway to citizenship. In 2007 the CBO stated that ""in aggregate and over the long term, tax revenues of all types generated by immigrants - both legal and unauthorized - exceed the cost of the services they use."" It's absolutely possible that a long, drawn out arduous process can be accommodated with a pathway to citizenship if it was thoroughly implemented. As for other policies, the U.S. State Department has already set biometric data rules for visa/foreign workers. The U.S. needs better policies to deter and prevent unlawful stay over. Biometric reading devices should be required at the border and in airports to complement other systems already in place. Congress should also work to deter birth tourism by requiring sonograms for women on tourist or business visas (B-1 and B-2 visas in consular parlance). The effect of illegal immigration is wreaking havoc on our immigration policies by far, especially from illegal immigrants and unlawful visa overstays from Mexico and Latin America. Many will not comply with a pathway towards amnesty because they would not fit the requisite; not even if obtaining an ITIN helped to suit the goal. Many will just choose not to comply out of fear. But flying under the radar does them no justice as they will eventually wind up homeless and on the street.","The US should focus on strengthening NAFTA. This would curb several issues related to immigration and the manufacturing of goods with inexpensive labor. Nonetheless it would help stabilize Latin America's poverty problems. This would support our domestic industries and allow the US to rely less on Pacific trade partners. China, of all trade partners, manages to steal billions in intellectual property. The Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property estimates that stolen trade secrets, pirated software, and counterfeiting cost the United States between $225 billion and $600 billion per year. Our trade with Pacific partners, especially China, have grown stagnant and one sided. Nevertheless we are facing an ever growing militaristic threat as they build on atolls in the South China Sea. The US should lead the way of possibly removing China from the WTO if they continue flexing dominance over peaceful nations.",I support the Iran nuclear deal.,"As it stands North Korea may be looking forward towards negotiating a step-down denuclearization effort with the US. The US should seek a peaceful remedy with N. Korea, possibly opening the doors to a ""One Korea"" model to unfold.

The stock market is up, unemployment is down, the economy is strong,  our embassy will be moved to Jerusalem and foreign tyrants are afraid. President Trump has also transformed the Presidency in ways that were once unimaginable.","I support cutting taxes for everyone to spur economic growth which is what we are experiencing now, a strong economy. When tax rates are cut people are motivated to work, save and invest which helps economic growth.",The national debt should be a concern to all of us. We need a balanced budget amendment to head off this financial crisis the younger generation will pay for with higher interest rates.,"I believe that you can not legislate an end to inequality but government is a critical site for struggle and change. I would support legislation that would require public/private bodies to have regard to the need to eliminate discrimination, advance the equality of opportunity and the financial consequences of noncompliance are made real.","I will support common sense gun control with universal background check, a ban on high capacity magazines and military style assault weapons . The NRA states that ""Guns don't kill people, bad people kill people "" agreed, but we should not easily give bad people access to guns.","I would advocate for a Patient Centered Healthcare system which involves listening to, informing and ensuring that patients values guide all clinical decisions. My wife Chioma Eze a nurse and other doctors heavily influenced my view in healthcare. The healthcare professionals shared the view that when patients are treated with dignity and respect they tend to recover from their illness quicker.","The federal government would need the help of the voters in Baltimore city to vote the democrats who have been running the city for over 40 years out of office. The democrats have successfully cultivated an image of themselves as the protectors of the poor, the fact is the cities in the United States most afflicted by crime, poverty and unemployment have been run for decades by democrats (Baltimore, Detroit, St. Louis, Philadelphia, Trenton, Chicago etc.). We really need to consider other parties when we vote and ask what have we been getting back for our votes? If you only vote for one party, not only will the party you always vote for take you for granted but the other party will completely neglect you.","Congress should treat the opioid crisis as a national security threat and pour more federal funding into poioid addiction treatment. Congress should also mandate two years of treatment for people addicted to opioids, 30 days of treatment is not enough to effectively combat the opioid crisis.",Immigration is one of the lingering issues that both parties do not have a desire to resolve because they can use immigration to ginger their base during election cycles. I would support securing our borders (terrorists have indicated an interest in the past to enter through our southern borders) but establish a program of providing Guest Workers with a path to citizenship.,"Yes, with the provision that companies may not move their base. This is to incentivize trade and create jobs.

Grigorian,Grigorian,11/17/1968,Bethesda,Republican,Montgomery County,http://www.grigorianforsenate.com,grigorianforsenate,grigoriansenate,,"Bachelor of Arts, History, The George Washington University (1990); Master of Arts, Education Policy (with honors), The George Washington University (1992); Juris Doctor, the University of Maryland School of Law (1996)",Lawyer,"To date, the Trump administration has undertaken certain initiatives that are good for Marylanders. Most importantly, this includes federal tax reform, which as put an extra $1700 in 73% of Marylanders' pockets. In addition, he has taken a hard look at our trade agreements and is working to ensure American companies are not disadvantaged globally when they attempt to enter foreign markets. Finally, the Trump administration has begun to ensure that American laws related to immigration are enforced; although solutions are necessary to address the 11 million people living in the United States illegally, we must be sure that our country, which is founded on the rule of law, is operated in accordance with the laws passed by the U.S. Congress..","I wholeheartedly support the federal tax cuts passed in 2017. For too long, American companies bore tax burdens that were significantly impacting their ability to expand and to provide important benefits to their workers, including healthcare and continuing education initiatives.","The debt service burden we are placing on generations to come is troubling. Congress needs to work harder and smarter to curb spending and make the necessary choices so that our children's futures are not mortgaged because our elected leaders failed to act on this issue. It is also important to note that, as the Fed raises interest rates, the amount of money Americans owe on our national debt also grows which will likely lead to a future drag on the U.S. economy.","Economic inequality is a problem and those of us who live in Maryland see it, know it and live it. Now is the time for us to understand as a nation that creating better jobs is the key to creating stronger families. Our elected leaders must look at the areas where growth in future technologies seems likely (including alternative forms of energy and transportation) and create economic initiative sectors so that all of those in Maryland benefit when the ""jobs of the future"" become the ""jobs of today.""","I am a supporter of the Second Amendment. I believe this country was founded on the idea that responsible citizens may keep a gun in their homes in order to protect themselves. I do believe, however, that our country needs to do a better job enforcing existing laws related to crime and guns. Additionally, I believe a stronger background check system should be implemented. With respect to ""red flags"" laws, I support those laws to the extent there are checks on the ability for people to recklessly assert that a potential gun owner should not have a gun in his/her possession and feel very strongly about the need to protect the due process rights of a defendant in such a proceeding.","At the outset, the ACA needs to be modified to allow health insurance plans to operate across state borders. It is anti-competitive and a disservice to Americans to prevent market forces from coming into play in this sector of the economy. Additionally, there need to be new laws that better attack the waste and fraud in the American healthcare system -- according to a Harvard Business Review study, if we were able to reduce ""administrative complexity"" and fraud in healthcare, Americans would save over 16% of the dollars we spend on healthcare. Initiatives to tackle these components of health care delivery in the United States should be undertaken quickly and efficiently.","A rising economic tide raises all ships. We need to use the economic momentum we have with a lower federal corporate tax rate and find ways for the government to boost job creation in Baltimore -- whether it is creating certain ""initiative zones"" where the federal government and the State of Maryland partner together to create economic opportunities (and jobs) in Baltimore or accessing more federal money for early childhood education programs in the city.","Congress needs to work with local communities to develop initiatives to combat this very real threat to Maryland families and children. Congress should also look at programs like Maryland's own ""Talbot Goes Purple,"" an initiative started by Sheriff Joe Gamble, to educate students on Maryland's Eastern Shore about the dangers of opioids, as a cost-effective model for educating America's school-aged children on the dangers posed by these drugs.","We are a nation of laws. As such, Congress must study and assess the needs of our country and determine the appropriate levels and types of immigration opportunities available to those who seek to come here (I should note that my father legally immigrated to this country in 1960 from Poland so I am well aware of the promise of the ""American dream"" for those given the gift of citizenship in this country). Once those laws are passed, they need to be enforced with all deliberate attention. Finally, i am in favor of legislation that would require local jurisdictions to turn over illegal criminals who have been convicted of felony crimes in this country to federal authorities for deportation.","I believe in mutually beneficial, negotiated trade partnerships like the Trans Pacific Partnership and NAFTA and support both of these initiatives.","Iran has shown that it is not interested in promoting peace and democracy amongst its people as the ""governed"" in that country have repeatedly protested their treatment at the hands of a repressive regime. Additionally, Iran has shown that it is willing to work against American interests in the Middle East, especially with respect to Syria. It is time to reassess the 2015 Nuclear Deal and determine how its continued implementation benefits the American people and American interests globally.","The current Korean threat is an unacceptable outcome resulting from years of neglect. It is time for our diplomats and leaders to enter into discussions that incentivize Kim to demilitarize the Korean peninsula. America must also more fully address the role China has played in allowing this imbalance to occur. And, as always, America's military muscle must stand at the ready if called upon to defend this country from Kim's threats and aggressive actions.",How do you assess the Trump administration so far?,Do you support or oppose the federal tax cuts passed in 2017?

He earned a master's degree in Military Studies / Intelligence Operations from American Military University while on active duty. With the repeated urging of his leadership and mentors while on active duty at NSA, he pursued his passion for public policy by working on his PhD in Public Policy / Homeland Security at Walden University and is currently a PhD candidate working on his dissertation. Erik also attended Harvard Extension school while on active duty, studying Middle Eastern studies.","Erik Jetmir is a candidate for the United States Senate for Maryland. He was born in 1967, grew up in Harlem and the Bronx in New York.  Erik is the son of a Korean War veteran who became a Baptist minister in Harlem, his mother is from Albania and met his father while attending college. Growing up in New York, Erik developed a sincere love for sports and learning. As a direct result of the attack of 9/11, Erik was moved to get personally involved and decided to serve in the military of his country. He left a thriving TV production company that he and his brother formed, joined the Navy Reserves, and currently holds the rank of Chief Petty Officer. On the civilian side he chose to become a Senior Research Scientist developing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) and Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) solutions for the Department of Defense.  Erik's technical and policy research in this area is credited with achieving significant advances for the U.S. efforts oversees and at home in the continued fight against terrorism.  After observing the current Trump administration policies, and the overwhelming groundswell of public support for significant change against these polices, Erik resigned his position as a Research Scientist to run for the office of United States Senator representing Maryland to fix those things our current Legislative Branch leadership has been unwilling and unable to fix.","The Trump administration continues to fail the test of leadership, effective policy and managing the growth and prosperity for the entire nation. Withdrawing from the Paris agreement demonstrates that he lacks vision and an operating understanding of the basics of climate change. Continuing to push for a travel ban a lack in US fundamental history and the essential value the national has placed on its on strong and extensive immigrant heritage. The obsession with the Wall a xenophobic personal flaw only matched by an inability to learn from the facts and an obsession of repealing the Affordable Care act that can only be characterized as both ill-informed and committed to staying that way.  The Trump administration shortfalls with the LGBT community are tragic and clearly express a world view shared by increasingly less within the nation and world.",Oppose. The tax cuts where a bet placed against the middle class and the poor at the expense of giving the wealthy a significant tax break. This will increase the deficit by driving up interest rates.,"The level of national debt is a serious concern. Under the Trump administration we are see extraordinary increased in national debt to the tune of an 84% jump from the previous year. Add to this a massive debt created by the Bush administration fighting 2 wars, we are seeing that choosing poor leadership costs the poor and middle class of the nation.","The level of economic inequality in the United States is a tragic problem. Labor grow has not improved with the growth of profits. This is a reality. Americans are doing a lot more work, producing a lot more output and giving their companies a great ability to resell the products and services they create. Essentially, you are working harder and doing more every year, your company is utilizing that labor to increasingly turn a profit, but they are not compensating the workforce for this increase in productivity! Compensation is not keeping up with productivity. If you are wealthy, you have mastered the process of acquiring and keeping capital. The federal government should focus on areas that drive social mobility like education and innovation.","The nation need to coalesce around the idea that our young people are demanding that we increase the safety of schools and neighborhoods. To achieve this there needs to be landmark bipartisan agreements to come to the table with solutions that address this. This includes bipartisan support for research that defines the role of guns in this kind of violence, and bipartisan support for change that effects the root-causes. What protects the second amendment rights of our citizens should not be at the cost of the lives of our young people.",Health Insurance has an impact on all Americans and represents challenges that directly affect all communities. Congress needs to support s single-payer health insurance program with a strong mandate (backed by incentives) to innovate and root out waste insures a system that addresses the entire population. The key is to mandate and fund incentives to innovate all processes and ensure waste is addressed at every level.  The Affordable Care Act is essential to the nation developing real solutions and needs to be strengthened.,"The cost of living continues to challenge Baltimoreans and the impacts to these costs like water, and utilities are squarely in federal government's ability to support state wide changes. The lack of political will to establish affordability programs speaks directly to that. This combined with a critical need to ensure there is reform in addressing persistent challenges with violence in our Baltimore communities needs to see more than the status quo response in respect to policy reform and community involvement in these critical areas.",Substance Use Disorders continue to rise and now presents a national crisis. States need to effectively budget for this growing problem and without these additional resources there will continue to be an increase in this use. The top thing congress can do is expand access and funding to programs that have been proven to be effective in driving change on this critical issue.,DACA represents a way forward to ensure we are providing a path of citizenship to many of the folks that are already here and doing great things in our country. We need to look at our immigration policy in the perspective (1) as the foundation that built this nation (2) our enduring legacy of inclusion and multiculturalism. I would build on that foundation with a strong focus on national security. We need to support a path to citizenship and improve the processed of naturalization.,"Trade deficits demonstrate underlying economic issues that are impacting the nation. This includes those kinds of economic impacts that are often a result of people's ability to buy and consume goods. Driving or resisting the mechanics of this process have limited impact when compared to investing and driving innovation and investment into business growth and business innovation. This can be impacted by supporting domestic policies that directly affect consumption, business growth and exchange rates.","I support the Iran Nuclear Deal. The sanctions against missile technology are critical, sanctions that limit the ability of Iranian connected actors to in any way support terror is essential. We must strengthen these important areas and ensure we limit Iran's involvement in destabilizing activities. This combined with increased focus on limiting human rights violations establishes a framework for addressing these persistent issues.","Since leaving the Six Party negotiations on denuclearization in 2008, denuclearization for North Korea has been deeply challenging. To make real progress the US will have to put great pressure on Pyongyang to make clear that there is only one path; denuclearization. It must be clearly established any other path jeopardizes their survival.

America has been deprived of information by news outlets so individuals like myself really have to work at retrieving factual information as opposed to being fed propaganda from Russia and other sources. Jobs are up significantly for every income and ethnic group, personal and business income for everyone is up significantly, America has now become larger than Saudi Arabia in oil reserves and is challenging Russia as a natural gas supplier. There are other, unpublished, successes.",I support the tax cuts of 2017. Just as the Robert F.

The failure to provide us, the citizens, the one's who authorize the government to exist, with a budget is embarrassing. Congress has been using the treasury of the U. S. A. to provide ""stuff"" to people essentially buying votes. The EGG Campaign I initiated may have a significant impact on the economy. New Congressman will not be indebted to others and could use normal thinking to produce a balanced budget.","The U. S. government requires permission from its citizens to do anything. Its what makes America unique among nations. The government should not be selecting ""winners"" like Solyndra. Economic rules, like lacrosse rules, should be known before the first whistle. They should not change at half-time nor should they change during a play. The government should encourage individuals to make a difference in the lives of others, their neighborhoods, and the businesses which surround them.","A change in gun laws is appropriate. Traditionally, gun laws have only affected law abiding citizens and are written that way. Most gun laws target the law abiding population but ignore criminals. Current law lists penalties for all manner of gun law violations but the reality is that the first charge to be dropped is the gun charge. Additionally, the 5 year penalty for possessing an illegal gun is seldom meted out. Filling out a NICS form with an untruth is unprosecuted. Guns protect cops, guns protect security guards, guns protect soldiers, and guns protect Presidents. Why not law abiding citizens?","When Maryland controlled healthcare if a problem arose an individual could call the Maryland Insurance Commissioner to attempt relief. If that didn't work you approached the Maryland Governor. If that didn't work you harangued your Delegate and State Senator. Just six people. With Obamacare, to make any changes, I must now engage 217 Congressmen and 60 Senators or get a Cabinet Secretary in Washington, DC to change something. Federal control of healthcare is too much. Alaska is not Maryland and one rule won't do.","Let citizens keep and spend their own money. The National government should encourage efficiencies in governance and refuse to permit illegal anything. Criminals who use the mail, Fed Ex, and Western Union to commit crime across state lines need to be caught. Export assistance is vital to established businesses and critical to startups and entrepreneurs. Lord knows there are enough existing plans, programs, loans and grants to boost Baltimore. Coaching or cheerleading is what is needed from the federal government.","Make sure doctors know that the problem exists. Educate suppliers enough that they can be part of the solution. Educate the citizenry so that they don't ""just say yes"" to an opioid prescription. Enforce existing law.","Borders are like front doors on a refrigerator. If just anyone can come into your house and open the refrigerator its probably not your house. America, until very recently, was one of the few countries where adherence to the law was of utmost importance. We cherished the law and followed it. I will need 59 other like minded individual Senators to change the law but ""legal"" needs to be returned to the conversation. Conversation is precisely what is needed. I have initiated the EGG Campaign - Everybody's Gotta Go so that I may work with a new set of Congressmen.","The government should not pick economic or industrial winners. However, if America is placed at a disadvantage our government should ensure the playing field and the same rules apply to all competitors. For instance, China steals patents. Its just what they do. It has to end.",No.,"Arrange for the North Koreans to deposit their nuclear warheads and their centrifuges with a cooperating nation, China, South Korea, Taiwan, or America. The North Koreans had signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty as well as treaties with the United States concerning the status of their nuclear programs.

I used to teach Philosophy of Education and the distinction is essential to any serious thinking about education policy.  The schooling part is easily told. I grew up in the Bronx, skipped the eighth grade and went to the Bronx High School of Science. Then on to the City College of New York, a free public college, where I did a double major in Economics and Philosophy. Then to the University of Michigan for a doctorate in Philosophy and then back to school for a Masters in Public Affairs.  Education was different. Some in school and lots from life. In school, Aristotle, Dewey, Galbraith, Sartre, the early Marx were all important.  Real world: - My father, who was a garment worker and a socialist, and an immigrant. - My uncle who had less money that we, and was happier. - A summer community where Normal Thomas gave the Labor Day speech (I still belong). - The first teach-in against the War in Viet Nam. - Some teachers who were role models. - Running a peace organization for 29 years, - Engaging with terrorists, Arafat, Habash, Haniyeh. - Engaging with members of Congress, occasionally one I truly respected, such as Donald M. Fraser of Minnesota whom I worked for. - Meeting top leaders such as Shimon Peres, and Abba Eban, and Prime Minister Olmert -- and being impressed by some and not others. - My students in ten years of teaching the Bible - And Genesis 18:25 when Abraham says to God, ""Shall not the judge of all the Earth deal justly?"" which shows that the perspective of the Bible is that morality precedes God, and that most of organized religion does not understand the Bible, which is very instructive indeed.","- Taught Philosophy at University of Pennsylvania. - Worked on Capital Hill for four years including two on House Budget Committtee. - Ten years in USAID on international development, especially basic human needs. , - Twenty years at Institute for Philosophy and Public Policy in the School of Public Affairs, U of Md. - 29 years as Director of The Jewish Peace Lobby.","There is no Administration. There is only Mr. Trump. In time and if need be, he will replace and uproot, each and every appointee. Moreover, there is no real policy. Trump can flip from day to day, and leave each and every appointee flapping in the wind.  In the entire history of the country, we have never experienced this. Not to say that policy-wise there are not worse potential Repubican Presidents than Trump. There is Ted Cruz, and Mr. Pence, who cares about Israel because he really believes that Jesus is waiting in the wings until the rightwing Government secures the ancient Kingdom of David.  And speaking of Israel and the Palestinians, the primary area of my expertise, a conflict I have been involved with for now 36 years, the jury is still out. The recognition (outside the negotiations room) of Jerusalem as Israel' s Capital was a disaster. It was, of course, egged on by the AIPAC supporters in Congress, most notably Senator Cardin. But that aside, the real question is the character of the long-awaited Trump plan  to end the conflict. As a conflict resolution expert, I have kept lines of communication with the Aministration open. A few weeks ago I shared ideas with NSC professionals in a three-hour meeting. There remain, despite the hollowing out of the State Department, some good principled people and they say that no one, not the Palestinians nor the Israelis, know what is in the Trump plan. So, who knows?","The United States suffers from growing income inequality with respect to pre-tax income. The tax system should be progressive, so that after tax-income is significantly less unequal than pre-tax income.   Every non-partisan analysis of the Trump tax cut showed that most of the benefits went to the rich and the very rich. The cuts made things worse.  How such could be politically sustainable? The answer is that in dollar terms taxes were reduced for most people. So with more money in their pocket people are, for the moment, satisfied.  This is essentially the ""bread and Circuses"" contempt for ordinary people  first developed by the Roman emperors. To see the sick joke here, any politician can put more money in everyones pocket by just cutting all taxes in half, or should they want, by just eliminating taxes altogether.   But then how do we pay for government? Why we just borrow the money. We increase the deficit and thus the national debt. And guess what, that is exactly what the Trump tax cut did. It resulted in a vastly increased deficit, in order to give small bits of bread to the masses, and big loaves to the rich and super rich.  How will it affect the economy? With unemployment now relatively low, it may result in increased inflation. And if so, then guess what? The Federal Reserve fights inflation by dampening the economy, which means unemployment, and not for lawyers, but for low income people and minorities in particular. Welcome to America.","Intelligent economists disagree on how much national debt is a problem. Much depends on who we owe the money to. Is owing to China the same as owing to Canada?  And if that doesn't make clear that it is not a matter of a fixed number or debt-to-GDP ratio, consider that much of the national debt is actually owed to the Federal Government itself. When the US Government borrows money to cover the deficit (the gap between what we spend and the taxes we take in) the government issues Treasury Bonds. Sometimes American citizens, and sometimes foreign governments buy these bonds, paying us for them the cash we need to cover the deficit.  Guess what happened during the last recession. The Federal Reserve, to put money back into the economy to end the recession, bought up those Treasury Bonds, and paid for them with money i essentially created out of thin air. It bought  trillions of the national debt and now holds it. We owe much of the debt to ourselves. And the Social Security Trust fund also holds vast amount of our own debt.  Who can fathom this stuff. For me the issue basically a moral not economic. Taxes are the obligation we incur when we decide to spend collectively. In no responsible society do the adults decide to burden the next generation with our public consumption decisions. Moreover, paying as we go, serves as a constraint on both foolish spending and foolish tax cuts.","It is a major problem, and not just the unequal distribution of income, but the even more unequal distribution of wealth.  Government should contribute to reducing these inequalities through progressive tax systems. Often we do just the opposite. Once upon a time we had significant estate taxes which at least were intended to prevent the massive transfer of wealth from one generation to another, essentially creating a wealth Aristocracy. Now the little that remains of it, they label ""a death tax"" and seek to eliminate it altogether, even for those with fortunes in the billions.  The biggest contribution that the government could make is to really deal with unemployment. This falls differentially on different social groups in the society, and is a crushing blow, not just to income but to the entire economic career of those who are badly and regularly hit. We do not have to have significant unemployment in America if we are determined not to put up with it. The cost of eliminating unemployment is greater control of the economy. For instance during World War II, we had wage and price controls and we ran a red-hot economy with unemployment under 2% and inflation also under 2%.  So it can be done. If we choose not to, because of the benefits of a freer market, then the burden of this policy choice should not crush the most vulnerable. That's why I call for a legally enforceable Right to a Job (at a living wage) or to Retraining.","Rather than endlessly debating which solution is the best for school safety, we should set up a commission composed one third of bereaved parents, one third of police, and one third of teachers. The commission should identify five viable ideas. Then each school in the country should get a voucher to choose among the five. The decision will be made by teachers and parents. Then the best social scientists in the country should monitor the results and feed the evaluations back to the original commission. In time we will learn what works and solve this problem.  We need to become a learning society, not a talk-a-thon.","Medicare works . Medical option  for all, Stop the nonsense.","I'm from the Bronx, and lived in Philadelphia, in a marginal area. I loved Philly. Baltimore is like Philadelphia, one of the old American cities, a mixture of grit and gentrification.   Mostly in Baltimore, I'm there to get my life saved at Johns Hopkins. But the last time I was in Baltimore it was to speak to the Baltimore chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America, a group whose endorsement I would be proud to receive. The meeting was in a part of town where I was hesitant to get out of my car.  A few days ago, I met Rikki Vaughn, a fellow candidate running for Senate, and a child of inner city Baltimore. I'm hoping he will show me around the real city.   At the March For Our Lives, I gave out fliers affirming The Right to a Childhood Without Fear, a right of all children, both the middle class, mostly white, children, now stalked in schools and concerts, and the inner city children of Baltimore who had the bad luck to be born into a 24/7 shooting gallery.   I said transforming the inner cities will take decades, but we can do something now to cut homicide rates for children and young people in the inner cities: Get them out of there. Summer vacation is 20% of the year. I proposed free sleep-away camp, a full summer, for any child in the 10 most dangerous cities in America. Baltimore is number six.","I don't fully understand the opioid epidemic. We do, of course, know about the terrible and perhaps criminal promotion of an addictive pain killer that was given to millions without its dangers being properly understood. The need for enforcement and regulation is obvious. When these kinds of things happen, I tend to favor sending some of the high and mighty to jail. It serves as a wake-up call. Monetary fines just get passed through the system, and in the end, are largely paid  by consumers. But send some CEO to prison, that's a whole new ballgame.  I had my own opioid experience. I had pancreatic cancer and underwent surgery. in response to my pancreatic cancer, an operation called ""The Whipple.""  For pain, I was put on opioids.  It affected me powerfully, but in a weird way. Even more than usual, I thought every idea I had was brilliant. I couldn't see the downside of anything, and ideas came at record speed. Some  too stupid to relate. But none were dangerous. What is really strange is that this went on for about six months, way long after I stopped taking the opioid. What it brought home: If your reasoning is itself affected, then your free-will is gone.   But what I don't get, or perhaps I do, is why anyone would actually seek out opioids. In this it is much like other powerful drugs. At bottom the drug problem exists because lives have gone bad, it's the effect, not the cause.","This country has a choice. Do we stand with the Statue of Liberty or not. We went through a great crisis when the Trade Towers went down because of terrorists. But the Statue of Liberty was in New York harbor and it did not fall. And on the statue, we don't have a sign telling the world to send us your smartest and best educated. Rather it says, ""Send us your teeming masses, seeking to breathe free."" It says ""Send us your wretched.""  That is my America. That's the country my father came to  and my mother's parents as well. And they didn't go to college, and low and behold, one generation later and their son in over-educated and has written six books and has three more on the way, and invests in Apple stock.   And anyway, we really know so little about these wretched refugees. My dad was a garment worker, but in Europe, in his little village, he was a prince, because he came from the family of a Rabbi whose biographies occupy five inches of card space in the Library of Congress. At Ellis Island, they never asked. And when he was told that from now on his name would be Albert rather than Anshel, he thought it was the law.","The entire free trade argument, though widely accepted by economists, is specious. It rests on an economic model of ""efficiency"" that shows that with the absence of trade barriers that the largest aggregate economic pie can be achieved. In theory, those who are harmed by free trade can be compensated for their losses, and some pie will still be left over.  This is wrong-headed on so many levels:  1) The compensation is just theoretical. The displaced workers and communities take it on the chin.  2) The calculation of ""losses"" reflects the typical economists' psychological blindness. They never properly understand just how great the losses are to real people and real communities.  3) The United State is in a stage of ""Post-scarcity"" capitalism. Even if it were true that the pie got larger, and even if it were fairly distributed, this isn't what American needs. Our real problems aren't going to be solved by given everyone a 10% raise, or + 20%, or +30%.   Much of what we think of as economic issues are really cultural. Thus, compared to almost every society in human history, the way we treat the elderly is debased and sick. In the poorest societies in the world, old people are respected elders. They end their lives surrounded by grandchildren and great grandchildren. Here we tell young people to start their 401 K's as soon as possible so they are not destitute when they are old and alone and adrift.","The Iran Nuclear deal was a triumph of diplomacy. It averted a military strike on Iran, a course of action sought by Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and supported by Senator Cardin. Cardin was one of four Democrats who joined with all 54 Republicans in an effort derail the deal. This would have been a disaster. We would not know if it was total, or if Iran was now racing towards a weapon.Troops would have to go in just to be sure. American troops. In a Washington Post article Cardin offered a defense of his vote. It was a strange analysis, and just like Prime Minister Netanyahu's speech to the Congress, it was silent about the central achievement of the deal, and it thus contributed to today's atmosphere in which there is a widespread failure to understand just how remarkable the deal actually was. Iran's nuclear program was based on attaining the capability of building nuclear weapons from highly enriched uranium. On the eve of the deal they were about two months away from achieving this capability. In the deal, all this was undone. They gave up their entire stockpile of medium enriched uranium and 97 % of low enriched, essentially going back to square one, and then they agreed to a 15 year freeze on any enrichment.  Fifteen years is a very long time in international affairs, enough time for fundamental to be altered. The entire Nazi regime went from 1933 to 1945, twelve years.","By getting in a time machine and going back to 1945, and doing everything pertaining to nuclear technology differently. This horror story comes from decades and decades of not taking proliferation seriously, really, really seriously. North Korea is a nuclear Sparta. Like the Spartans, it lives on nothing, consumes almost nothing. And like Sparta, it can defeat/destroy almost any country in the world, except the great nuclear powers themselves. Even here it pushes the envelope. That we have permitted the emergence of a hermit-Kingdom with a nearcrazed leadership, to gain the ability to deliver a nuclear holocaust to much of the United States, is an indictment of every President, every Secretary of State and every National Security Advisor going way, way back. I confess to being impressed that so far President Trump seems on the right track. His willingness to get into face to face negotiations speaks well of him, and frankly, we are not in any position to second guess him. The information gap between us and what is known inside the NSC is vast. He should always err on the side of not initiating the military con􀃘ict. We should all pray that we and the world get out of this intact. If there is a way to truly put the genie back in the bottle we should be prepared to pay ALMOST any price to do so. Any accurate accounting of North Korea's existing (not potential, but existing) nuclear arsenal and missile delivery system is simply terrifying.",How do you assess the Trump administration so far?,Do you support or oppose the federal tax cuts passed in 2017?

We have always been great. I think we need to put this country first and realize that when America does well, the rest of the world does too. I support his efforts on closing the trade gap with China. I believe in legal immigration and not giving rights to non-citizens, while the rights of Americans are being disregarded. An true assessment of his administration is virtually impossible, as they have a high turnover rate. I would not utilize social media in the manner that he does, but it doesn't seem to be hurting him in polling. Like it or not, I believe it gives us better insight into what the President is thinking.","I support the federal tax cuts, as I support any effort to reduce the amount of money that Americans pay to the IRS by either party. That is not just a Republican thing. The effects on the economy should be positive. The more money people have, the more they will spend. Increased consumer spending means that more jobs will be needed to meet the demand.","I am a budget hawk. Government spending is out of control and the borrowing has to stop. I believe the economic success of an administration should be based on how much they reduce the debt, while keeping consumer confidence high. With Republicans controlling the House, the Senate, and the White House, I am very surprised to see the estimated growth of the debt under the President's budget. I will support any effort to reduce the overall size of the federal government. I will introduce legislation to limit the scope of federal intrusion on state regulation by not specifying where states should spend the appropriations made to them by Congress.","It is very much a problem. I believe inequality impacts much more that just economic factors. The economy is a good way to begin to address it, but working on closing the gap across the entire spectrum of equality and fairness is the only thing that will work. In the inner city, the inequalities that are demonstrated by the judicial system leads to economic inequalities in that the over-policing of citizens, as has been demonstrated in several USDOJ investigations into the constitutional patterns and practices of local police departments, has caused the arrest of many people who were abiding by the law. The mere fact that an arrest is reported on an applicant's job application or resume is typically a disqualifier from someone being able to obtain a job. Some of those law abiding people lost their jobs. The government's responsibility in this aspect is huge and we must do better at making determinations that affect how they are able to live. As for the economic challenges we face, we need to attract more opportunity from the private sector in the inner cities. We must improve the education that is provided in our public schools, rather than promote charter schools, if their model is best, we copy that. Our children deserve the best possible education that we can give them. This will lead to them getting better jobs. We need to build the infrastructure that allows us to attract the opportunities to locate their interests in our communities.","I am a constitutionalist, so I believe that any restriction on our rights must be handled according to the rules that apply to convening a constitutional convention.","In Maryland, the number 1 driver our economy is healthcare. I have a problem with that. Maryland is the single largest payer of medical bills in the state. We should use that leverage to negotiate better rates from providers and improve our state hospital network to provide competition that raises the level of care provided by private hospitals while lowering costs.","As I mentioned, the federal government is too entangled in state government to do any good and needs to get out of the way. Maryland Democrats have taken away the rights of citizens to approach the grand jury in Baltimore City and request a criminal investigation into allegations of corruption charged against public officials. This shields the leadership from any prosecution and the State's Attorney refuses to exercise the discretion required to charge them. This is when the US Attorney's Office should step in, assess the allegations for evidence of federal crimes, and submit them to a federal grand jury. Applying the fair and equal justice system that we promote will help foster trust and better working relationship with the federal government, rather than contempt for it.","Aggressively prosecute the professional drug trade, as well as we do the illegal trade of it. In the meantime, Congress needs to provide a fix and that fix is treatment rather than incarceration for those affected by drug addiction. This support should also extend to the family of those addicted to opioid prescription medications due to the government's failure to act to stem the tide that this immense public health emergency has become. I support tougher sentences for those convicted of drug dealing and for those convicted of dealing in opioids should receive the death penalty if a death can be tied to their illegal operation.","I believe that the current objective of removing people who entered the US illegally is appropriate. I support a path to legal citizenship for those brought here by illegals, such as the situation that exists with the ""Dreamers."" Congress must observe the constitution when drafting laws and the Supreme Court must abide by it when those laws are challenged. The laws must make protecting American citizens a priority and permitting illegal behavior to occur is a direct threat to the public safety. Providing for the national defense requires having strong borders.",I support the renegotiating of all trade deals. NAFTA has been completely disastrous for American workers and it should be torn up immediately. America First!,Nope!,"Like Reagan handled the Soviet Union and ensure them that any aggression towards America will be met with exactly what President Trump described, as fire and fury the likes of which the world has never seen before. We can longer submit to the regime's attempts to draw us into conflict. I am against providing economic assistance to North Korea and any humanitarian relief for them should be accomplished by a coalition of countries that have an interest in having peaceful relations with the current regime. The North Korean leader must be held accountable for the murder of Otto Warmbier.

,YES,us-senate,"Richard ""Rikki"" Vaughn",Vaughn,01/28/1980,Baltimore,Democratic,Baltimore County,http://www.rikkivaughn.com,,,http://surveygizmoresponseuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/fileuploads/296249/4299807/179-21af3c6d8c3b9e22a68e4327a9c340ad_Rikki_Vaughn_US_Senate_Headshot.jpg,BS- Hampton University magna cum laude MBA- University of the Southwest,CEO and business owner,"The Trump administration has had dangerous implications on our nation. In addition to ignoring the support for our society's most vulnerable residents in housing, immigration, small business development, transportation/infrastructure, education, higher education, and the environment his foreign policies have a negative impact on US farming and agriculture. In the end, his existence as Commander-in-chief undermines our credibility as a leader in the world and our democracy.","Federal tax cuts of 2017 were drastic. A cut from 35% to 21% was too steep of a cut for both corporations and government to unknowing implications. There was a consensus that federal corporate tax cuts were needed to compete with nations who had lower tax rates that were luring US businesses away. However, a tax cut of this magnitude was too risky for a leader of the US to make. It would have been a more responsible decision to wean in the tax cuts over time to reduce risk and uncertainty to American corporations and the US government. If US corporations don't return from overseas in droves in year one of the tax cut our economy could take a major hit.","The national debt is a major concern for the security of the US economy and for all future generations for our nation. There are several things we can do reduce our debt. The first thing we can do is do away with laws that restrict growth of US industry. The cannabis industry, for example, could produce billions of federal dollars if it is allowed to not be listed as a Schedule 1 substance. Two, after receiving billions more in tax revenue from cannabis sales the US government could spend the same amount of dollars on fixed expenses in healthcare and the military while having more dollars to reduce the debt.","Economic inequality is one of the principal factors that keeps the US from excelling and fulfilling its promise of being one nation for ALL. The federal government has a role to support local programs in neighborhoods that are working while also creating opportunities for groups to compete for grants to fund projects that will change lives. One example is education. Educational inequality is a major hurdle. The US government can give extra funding to programs that produce strong outcomes to expand them to quadruple outcomes. This can also be done in small business development, wealth management education, tech education, and higher education to use existing vehicles of education and higher education institutions to break the cycle of economic inequality by offering money from the US government to educate and train without requirement of cost on low income residents.","Federal laws on guns should be changed to allow more background checks on gun owners and gun purchases. I'd look for ways to license and register fire arms in similar ways as we license and register vehicles in the US. Through the license plate we know when vehicles are stolen and who owns the vehicle that may have fled the scene of an accident. Serial numbers of guns could be embedded within the gun to not be filed off if it is illegally sold. Also, a ban on the sales of automatic weapons and the equipment's, like bump stock, that can make weapons automatic is needed. In the end, laws that both prevent mass shootings and illegal gun sales to urban cities need to be passed as soon as possible to save lives.","The Affordable Care Act (ACA) was never a perfect piece of legislation, however, it doesn't need to be scrapped it needs to be strengthened. My belief is a single-payer ACA would be better for businesses and provide better services to tax-payers. A single-payer ACA would also ensure health insurance for all while providing more resources for local hospitals that are on the verge of closing because they're receiving less revenue as a result of fewer people having health insurance. A single-payer ACA would give less pressure on businesses because they could spend less money on healthcare having an Employer Single-Payer ACA that could be almost a Gold Card health insurance that could have employers spend less money on health insurance and employees would get a premium network of medical care paid for by businesses and the ACA. How do we pay for this? Billions received from tax revenue received from cannabis sales could help these costs.","Cities like Baltimore need support from the federal government in a myriad of ways. Financial support in existing areas of need in healthcare, economic development, housing, education, and higher education are all important. But, the federal government also needs the vision to funding to organizations that can produce the best outcomes via requests for proposals (RFP's) that would yield strong results. For instance, the federal government could provide funding for low income residents in Baltimore to attend college tuition-free while also providing these colleges with funding to partner with corporations and high schools to provide education and job training to the next generation of leaders in Baltimore. In addition, the federal government could provide leadership in creating corporate/government partnerships to merge high school to college training and education to increase high school graduation rates and employment rates simultaneously. For criminal justice, the best crime prevention tool is a job. With a smart and realistic job readiness and education/higher education support plan, Baltimore residents will have the tools needed to compete in today's global economy.","Cannabis has been proven to be a tool used to prevent the continued use and spread of opioid addictions nationwide. In states that have cannabis available for recreational use there are low levels of opioid deaths. Cannabis could be used as both a treatment for opioid users and a non-lethal replacement for residents who choose to responsibly inebriate themselves. Laws on the books similar to alcohol consumption should be available for those who impair themselves while driving vehicles, etc. However, reducing cannabis off the list of being a Schedule 1 substance could result in a national drop in opioid addition cases. In addition to cannabis, I'll push to have funding to provide all law enforcement personnel to be trained and carry naloxone kits to prevent opioid deaths. With the combination of preventative and action-orientated methods we can address the opioid epidemic in a smart and effective way to overcome it.","Immigration laws in the US should be changed to: 1 allow children of immigrants who were born outside of the US, but raised in the US (Dreamers) should be allowed to stay in the US; 2 misdemeanors and small crimes by immigrants should not warrant deportation; 3 deportations should apply to those who commit violent crimes in the US and will be subject to imprisonments and punishments US courts would agree with; the notion of ending ""chain migration"" needs to be fought – we need to support law abiding immigrants who may need to sponsor their mothers, sisters, and cousins to help their family in the US; 4 open doors to asylum seekers – nations like Haiti, Cuba, and Honduras have histories of human rights abuses, poverty, and war in their nations, respectively. Asylum in the US is just and appropriate in those situations. 5 Change in US immigration policy based on fears of the changing demography of our nation is no way to run a nation. The current changes the GOP supports breaks up families, results in millions of dollars of lost revenue, and is not what leaders of a nation deemed ""the land of the free"" should do. There's room in the US for our Dreamers, those who overstay their F1 Visa's, and their families.","There is consensus on the left and right that unfair trade practices should not be tolerated. However, instead of working to undermine a foreign nation to get better trade deals, negotiations to reduce global tariffs on US products and services be a better approach. For instance, the current climate of US/China relations is resulting in a trade war costing millions of reduced value on American companies in a wide variety of sectors. A global consensus of unfair trade could have resulted in other nations joining with the US in this trade war that would add more pressure on China to allow more international banking and tech institutions access the China. A global approach would have resulted in better trade to China with not only the US, but also with partnered nations which could've resulted in better US trade with those partnered nations as well.","The Iran nuclear deal was constructed to end the threat of Iran obtaining nuclear weapons. There has been little evidence showing Iran is on the verge of attaining a nuclear weapon and so far the deal appears to be a success. When the deal was struck, sanctions were lifted from the European Union (EU) and other nations resulting in Iran receiving billions, having a stable economy again, and giving no reason for Iran to renege on the deal. I support the Obama lead Iran deal with one caveat, that Iran ends its proxy wars against our US allies in the region like Israel and Saudi Arabia. Conflicts in the region has resulted in thousands of people being killed from Syria to Yemen. I would support getting rid of the nuclear deal in favor of a more harsh deal on Iran if it continues with these proxy wars against our allies in the region.","Stronger sanctions and global pressure with allies against North Korea has forced North Korea to be more conciliatory towards South Korea and more willing to have a peaceful dialogue with the US. Continued pressure on North Korea to stay on the course to de-nuclearize while promising to lift sanctions and offer agricultural and infrastructural upgrades to North Korea, through South Korea, could all be on the table to push North Korea to give up their nuclear ambitions.",How do you assess the Trump administration so far?,Do you support or oppose the federal tax cuts passed in 2017?
