After high school, I enlisted into United States Army. After my honorable discharge, I graduated cum laude from Howard University in 1992 and recieved my law degree from William & Mary in Virginia in 1995.","I began my legal career working for the NAACP Legal Defense protecting civil rights. I soon became a law clerk to Judge David Mitchell in 1995 and in 1996, I was hired by Patricia Jessmy to become an Assistant State's Attorney. After working in the public sector, I moved to the private sector and worked for Schulman, Treem from 2004 to 2006. In 2006 is when I started my law firm, Bates and Garcia.",https://www.ivanbates.com,ivanjbates,ivanjbates,http://surveygizmoresponseuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/fileuploads/296249/4296412/245-5a69ebb1e6248afd8f2b3133f43eb50c_IvanBates-1192_preview.jpeg,Charging someone with a crime is the greatest power the State's Attorney has and it must be exercised with great discretion. My office will be selective and strategic at the initial charging stage at central booking.  I plan to reinstitute felony screeners and conduct more preliminary hearings to weed out bad cases within 30 days instead of six to eight months.,"As in any relationship, you must have trust and trust is earned. As a homicide prosecutor, my job wasn't about trust, but the evidence and the law. I evaluated the evidence and studied the case brought to my office by the Department, and exercised my professional judgment about whether or not there was probable cause that a crime had occurred. Being an attorney for 23 years, it's about building a case based on the evidence. There will be good and bad police officers, and as with any relationship, it must be based on trust.","The charging was rushed and the theory of the case was confusing. Many believe that Mr. Gray was injured on the street, but the State's Attorney believed he was injured inside the police van. To prove this, the State's Attorney granted outright immunity to too many different police officers involved in the incident â€“ and as the case developed, realized that was probably a mistake. The two prosecutors assigned to handle the trial by State's Attorney had never prosecuted a homicide in their career. The Freddie Gray trials were not the right time for them to get their start. The expert testimony was weak, and the State's Attorney never put forth a proper expert on police use of force.","There is a long list of experienced prosecutors who have left the State's Attorney's Office and a number of them have expressed an interest in coming back under my administration. In addition, a number of attorneys at the state and federal level have expressed an interest in working with me. The State's Attorney's Office under my leadership will be a office where prosecutors will have discretion in handling their cases and will have some of the top lawyers and judges to host training sessions. It will be an office where the culture will be one of support, creativity, and teamwork.",Yes,"My first week, my team will evaluate every case involving a violent repeat offender. I will select the ten best trial lawyers and they will each be assigned ten cases with the understanding that they're going to trial and cannot plea. Once we have won the cases in trials and have held the violent offenders accountable, we will then be able to send a message that the State's Attorney's Office will hold repeat violent offenders accountable. We then can focus on community prosecution -- to collaboratively work with the police and community and focus on violent repeat offenders.","As State's Attorney, I will follow the lead the city of Chicago and release all raw data and statistics generated by my office related to its performance (which data remains unavailable under the current administration).","My office will use all the legal tools we have to protect the identity of witnesses. For instance, we will ask for protective orders. The community liaison will be the contact person between the prosecutor and the witness after a statement is provided. In addition, we will go to Annapolis to ask for more funding for safe housing for victims and witnesses.","I am the only candidate in this race that has seen the criminal justice system through the eyes of both the defendant and victim. I have 23 years of experience and I am the only candidate that has worked in every unit in the State's Attorney's Office-- district, juvenile, circuit, and homicide as prosecutor. As an assistant state's attorney, I never lost a murder trial. As a defense attorney, I had the opportunity to work at a law firm and also, started my own firm. I have effectively operated a successful law office and I have trained new attorneys to become successful. I have worked with the police and I have also sued the police.

We instituted an updated case tracking form and review process to ensure office wide alignment of case information and rationales for STET/NP outcomes.   Our assessment revealed that lack of witness cooperation accounted for almost one third of case dismissals. I have always said that the criminal justice system is dependent on citizen participation, understanding and recognizing that when public trust diminishes, many individuals elect not to come forward.  I directed my front office to establish a targeted focus on bettering and augmenting victim and witness services. We understand Baltimore City's troubled past related to ""stop snitching"" and ""witness intimidation"" culture and the data we collected proved that theory and the need to do more.  In three years, we have completely restructured and doubled the size of the Victim-Witness Unit, secured a five-year, $2.4 million federal grant to enhance outreach and supportive services, established a public-private partnership to completely renovate a courthouse space dedicated specifically to victims and witnesses, and successfully lobbied to more than double (115% increase) witness relocation funding.  Also, we are working closely with the Police Department on a training program for officers both in the field and at the academy to ensure they can properly use body worn cameras and correctly file probable cause reports that build the strongest possible cases.","Yes.  I work with embedded BPD in my office every day and I come from four generations of police officers, and I personally understand the sacrifice that officers make every day to protect and serve our communities.    We all are aware of the unfortunate series of events in the past three years that have created serious challenges related to trust between our communities and the Baltimore Police Department. From the untimely death of Freddie Gray, to the Department of Justice's report on Baltimore Police patterns and practices, to body worn camera credibility concerns, and now the recent convictions for racketeering and corruption of several officers, a tremendous amount of concern, fear, and distrust are present in our city. I pledge to work closely with Commissioner DeSousa and the City Solicitor to address these problems, so the citizens of the City of Baltimore can restore trust in the Police Department and the criminal justice system as a whole.  My relationship with the BPD is not contradictory to my belief that we need significant reform of the criminal justice system.  I will always look for ways to strengthen our necessary relationship with our law enforcement partners and improve the criminal justice process. I will also continue to advocate for reform measures to ensure a more accountable, transparent, and citizen involved system is in place to establish oversight and continue to root out corruption. In 2016, I announced a criminal reform package which included an independent investigatory body similar to Prince Georges County.","I stand by my decision to charge the six officers involved in the death of Freddie Gray, Jr. I believe in one standard of justice regardless of one's sex, race, zip code or occupation; and still agree with the grand jury and judge's ruling that there was adequate probable cause to charge those individuals with the crimes alleged.  As a result of filing those charges, the criminal justice system in Baltimore has changed in significant ways. The Department of Justice reached a consent decree with the city requiring all officers to have body worn cameras, and other major changes in the policies and procedures of the Baltimore Police Department.  These reforms include: full implementation of body worn cameras on all officers; officers are now required to secure and seat belt all prisoners; cameras are now equipped in every police transport van; it is now mandatory for officers to call a medic when a suspect requests medical attention. Also, there is now a software verification and accountability system in place to ensure adherence of all departmental policies, general orders and/or procedures. Most importantly, there are now ""use of force"" policies that emphasize the sanctity of life, accentuates de-escalation, and requires that officers intervene if fellow officers cross the line.  These significant changes, locally and nationally, are the legacy of Freddie Gray Jr., and I'm proud to be associated with that legacy.","Our prosecutors are the brightest, most dedicated and highly effective attorneys in the country, who prosecute over 40,000 cases per year and maintain a 92% felony conviction rate.  My leadership team and I motivate our attorneys with opportunities to try some of the most complex criminal cases in the nation while reiterating their power of discretion and accountability to public safety for the City they serve.  Our philosophy is to recruit mission-minded prosecutors who share our commitment to justice over convictions and desire to make a difference in Baltimore City. We recruit attorneys who seek to hold violent, repeat offenders accountable, and build a better Baltimore by addressing the root causes of crime rather than merely seeking prison sentences. Our prosecutors have a wealth of experience, totaling nearly 1,800 combined years of service.  We must continue to grow our ranks by aggressively recruiting prosecutors from the illustrious law schools within the Baltimore region and throughout the country with an emphasis on increasing the diversity and cultural competency of our office.  The number of Assistant State's Attorneys who are women and people of color has increased significantly during my tenure, which is an important measure as we groom the next wave of professional prosecutors. In my office, 60% of my prosecutors are women. Of my hires, 56% are women; 31% are African American and 7% are Asian/Pacific Islander. We are making a concerted effort to recruit the best prosecutors, while being equally committed to the diversity of our prosecutors and staff.","The entire city of Baltimore and the many agencies committed to public safety share responsibility for addressing systemic issues in our criminal justice system.  Improving coordination between the Police Department, City Solicitor's Office, State and city elected officials, and the State's Attorney's Office is critical.  We have worked carefully together to form a new policy which requires Baltimore City police officers to discloseâ€”with or without a specific request by the Assistant State's Attorney (ASA) handling a case in which the officer is an integral witnessâ€”if an Internal Affairs (IA) file exists that charges him or her with any past or present misconduct. Officers will have to relay this information to the ASA at the earliest opportunity, whether or not the misconduct issues have been resolved.  Additionally, the City Solicitor's Office will be required to promptly review and send to the State's Attorney's Office any requests for IA records within 48 hours of receipt.  My office has also expanded the list of allegations which we disclose to defense attorneys including excessive force allegations, unlawful search and seizures, planted evidence, and other egregious complaints in the interest of transparency and to ensure our cases are conducted completely beyond reproach. This is consistent with our mission to pursue justice over convictions and to prosecute cases in a manner consistent with the highest ethical standards.  Lastly, we are one of a handful of offices in the country to publicly post detailed incident reports when we decide not to charge officers involved shootings.","After assessing the efforts of previous administrations and scouring through nationwide best practices, I elected to implement data driven and innovative strategies to address the violent repeat offenders wreaking havoc on Baltimore communities.

We developed the Crimes Strategies Unit (CSU), which compiles data and intelligence in an effort to build strong cases against some of the City's most heinous criminals from charging to conviction. Through this unit, we have implemented an arrest alert notification system, which allows us to monitor those who have been identified by law enforcement as the worst of the worst.

To better target gun offenders, I also created the Gun Violence Enforcement Division, which is an investigative and prosecutorial unit made up of highly skilled prosecutors and Baltimore Police detectives who focus on gun offenders, rather than just gun crimes. 

Additionally, understanding and recognizing that the drug trade fuels gun violence, I re-established the Narcotics Unit to combat our regions opioid crisis. This unit held a 98 percent conviction rate in 2017. 

Under my administration we have convicted all 12 of the defendants designated Public Enemy #1 by the Baltimore Police Department since 2015 who have been brought to trial, resulting in six life sentences and more than 700 years in prison.  

Using data driven approaches and ensuring close coordination between my office and the Police Department, including housing detectives in our unit offices, we are able to effectively prosecute violent repeat offenders and maintain a 92% felony conviction rate.","I'm proud of the prosecutors in my office who come to work every day to protect the people of our city.  Our felony conviction rate is strong at 92% but I don't believe this is an accurate measure of success in any prosecutorial office.  Ultimately my office seeks to impact the root causes of crime in our city.  That means engaging with our community with programs like Project 17 and Aim to B'more that help our young people by seeing them in classrooms and job sites instead of in courtrooms. 

That also means restoring the trust of our communities in a criminal justice system that all too often has not been responsive to its own shortcomings and led to citizens being unwilling to step forward into the system as witnesses.  Our office is not motivated by the statistics. We have a high conviction rate, but the modern prosecutor leads by pursuing justice, not running up empty stats. Ultimately, the true measure of success for any public servant in the criminal justice system is that the citizens of our city feel safe in their communities and in their homes.  We will continue to earn the public's confidence and trust by being wholly transparent with information, our processes by leveraging technology and data to give the public an unvarnished look into how we administer our office.","Victim and Witness services has been a priority from the start of my administration and it is a major factor in restoring the community's faith in the criminal justice system.  Under my leadership and direction, we have doubled the size of our Victim/Witness Unit with the support of a record $2.4 million in grant funding and placed a veteran prosecutor in charge of ensuring the unit was carrying out its essential duties efficiently and effectively.  This year the State's Attorney's Office secured an additional $360,000 per year of support for victim/witness relocation services from our advocacy in Annapolis. This money will enable us to protect our witnesses who fear returning to their communities after testifying and enable them to live with their families in safety.  We also renovated our Victim/Witness waiting room in the courthouse with trauma evidence-based and technologically advanced design.  Witnesses and victims often complained previously of needing to spend hours in the courthouse where they might run into defendants and their friends.  This room was designed with therapeutic touches recommended by science and provides our victims and witnesses a measure of comfort during what can be a harrowing time.  The SAO also launched community court watch â€“ a web-based tool that allows citizens to track case information for crimes occurring in their neighborhoods.  These initiatives are helping us get better cooperation from the community and we look to continue and expand our efforts on this front.","The privilege of serving the citizens of Baltimore City is the greatest honor of my life. With all due respect to my challengers, I am the only candidate who has served as State's Attorney and during some of the most turbulent times in our City's history, I have stood firm in my convictions and on the side of justice for all.  I understand that we MUST continue to press for progressive reform in the criminal justice system and bridge the divide between the justice system and the communities it serves.  Bridging that divide is why I chose to run for this office four years ago.  My family lives in the heart of West Baltimore and I see first-hand what is possible when you believe in the capacity of our City and our neighbors to do great things. I want every community to feel like that.  I am uniquely qualified to serve this City at this moment in our history. I am committed to the hard work of ushering in substantive reform and continuing to shift the trajectory of our City towards brighter days for each and every community. Building a criminal justice system that the people trust and want to participate in is the key to turning our city around and that is the work I do every day in office and hope to continue for the next four years.",What specifically will you do as state's attorney to minimize the number of cases that are nolle prossed?,"Given your professional experience, do you trust the Baltimore Police Department?",How do you evaluate the charging and prosecution of the officers involved in Freddie Gray's arrest?,What would you do to attract and retain experienced prosecutors?,"Do you plan to maintain a ""do not call"" list of police officers who aren't reliable witnesses?","What will your approach be to dealing with violent repeat offenders, and how will that differ from previous efforts?",What will you do to ensure the public can accurately judge the effectiveness of city prosecutors in securing convictions?,What can the state's attorney do to overcome the reluctance of many witnesses in Baltimore to cooperate with police and prosecutors and to testify in court?,What do you bring to the table that Baltimore needs that the other candidates don't have?,Nolle prosse,Police trust,Gray prosecutions,Prosecutor retention,Officer do-not-call,Repeat offenders,Accountability,Witness cooperation,Special skills
,YES,baltimore-city/states-attorney,Thiru Vignarajah,Vignarajah,12/18/1976,"Federal Hill, Baltimore",Democratic,"After a great education from local public schoolsâ€”Edmondson Heights Elementary, Johnnycake Middle, and Woodlawn High Schoolâ€”I had the privilege to study at Yale College and Harvard Law School, where I served as President of the Harvard Law Review.  I've always known how important education is. My parents are retired Baltimore City public school teachersâ€”my mom started teaching at Poly in 1970 and finished teaching at Morgan State; my father spent nearly 40 years as a city teacher, from Edmondson and Western to Digital Harbor and Douglass. He retired last year as the oldest teacher in Maryland, at the age of 80.  I have tried to pay tribute to my parents, teaching crime policy and constitutional law at Johns Hopkins University, University of Baltimore School of Law, and Maryland Law School, where I have repeatedly received the award for outstanding professor of the year. I have also helped coach debate at Frederick Douglass High School, where my father taught years ago.","I am a proven prosecutor and have devoted my career to public service. I have a plan to cut murders in half in three years, and I have the experience and track record to get it done.  Immediately after law school, I served as a law clerk to Judge Guido Calabresi, a federal appellate judge, and Justice Stephen G. Breyer on the United States Supreme Court. I have since served as a federal prosecutor at the U.S. Attorney's Office in Baltimore, as head of the Major Investigations Unit in the Baltimore City State's Attorney's Office, and most recently as Deputy Attorney General of Maryland.  I am the only candidate who has personally tried murder, wiretap, and gang cases, and I've tried those cases at the state and federal level. A veteran homicide detective once described me as ""the best prosecutor the city has ever seen""â€”I was also honored when a former police commissioner said the unit I led handled the ""toughest cases against the city's worst criminals."" And during my tenure in the Baltimore City State's Attorney's Office, we brought murders down to the lowest rate in decades.",http://www.thiruforbaltimore.com,thiruforbaltimore,thiru4baltimore,http://surveygizmoresponseuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/fileuploads/296249/4296412/52-d2fa947fe839226298eea96f41500110_thiru-vignarajah-headshot.jpeg,"The current State's Attorney is struggling to manage a high volume of cases, and prosecutors are routinely reviewing cases after they indict them instead of before. That is the first thing I will change. As a federal prosecutor, I was required to write a charging memo and get my supervisor's approval before taking an indictment to the federal grand jury. As head of Major Investigations in Baltimore City, I imposed a similar requirement. There are certainly instances where additional information or a case development requires a change of course, but dropping a case after indictment should be the exception, not the norm. We will also cooperate and collaborate better with our police and community partners. When we decline to indict a case, we should say whyâ€”and when we drop cases, we again should explain why. That is not for the sake of pointing fingers, but in the spirit of learning to avoid unnecessary mistakes.","The overwhelming majority of police officers in Baltimore are trying to do their job, build strong cases, and get home safe. As the Justice Department noted, however, there are systemic deficits in performance and training in Baltimore. The relationship between police and prosecutors must be built upon mutual respect and trust. That means police must know that part of a prosecutor's job is to hold them accountable, whether they are cutting corners or committing crimes. But the question shouldn't just be whether I trust them: it's whether the community does. With violent crime at an all-time high, communities across Baltimore need a police force they can trust. Citizens feel besiegedso do police. To restore integrity, we do not need to dismantle the police department. But we do need to rebuild how we hold police accountable. Because the current system is simply not working. It is too slow; it is too secretive; and it has sown massive injustice. We are not, however, just going to complain about the mess, we're going to clean it up. I will create a first-ever Civil Rights Division that will root out corruption, curb overtime abuses, ensure community input, and assist with police training when it comes to use-of-force and constitutional policing. We cannot rebuild trust overnight, but we have to start trying today.","It can be unfair to second guess another prosecutor's decision on a specific case because no one knows what was known or when. But, as a general matter, if a prosecutor is considering charging six individuals with serious crimes from misconduct to murder, based on a novel and untested legal theory, in a case that our city will treat as a referendum on police accountability, that investigation cannot be done right in two weeks. The good news is we know it can be done right. As we saw from the recent federal corruption trial, when prosecutors and police work together, we can build rock-solid cases that stand up in court against cops who have become robbers. There have now been over 1,000 murders since Freddie Gray's death. His legacy shouldn't be a city in crisis. We could have set the gold standard for how to investigate an in-custody death. Instead we saw what not to do. In the wake of his death, may we learn, rebuild, and heal -- that is a legacy we can all embrace.","Serving as a prosecutor in Baltimore City was, for me, the honor of a lifetime. Right now, Baltimore needs a State's Attorney's Office full of prosecutors who feel the same way. Our crisis of violent crime has to be a lightning rod to attract the best talent from around Baltimore and across the country. At the same time, to ensure a strong prosecutor's office and seasoned public servants, we will seek federal grants to raise salaries and establish world-class training. In addition, I have pledged that Assistant State's Attorneys will not be hired or fired based on political allegiances. Career prosecutors have enough to worry about without having to choose between making a living and speaking up for what they believe in. With a change in culture, vision, and resources, the Baltimore City State's Attorney's Office can become the premier prosecutor's office in the countryâ€”our present crisis demands it, and the citizens of Baltimore deserve nothing less.","Maintaining a ""do not call"" list is a blunt instrument for an issue that requires nuance. All witnesses, whether they are police officers or civilian bystanders or forensic experts, have strengths and weaknesses. If a police officer has lost his or her credibility to the point where they cannot be called in any criminal case, the solution is not to let them keep earning a paycheck doing a desk job instead of patrolling the streets. Conversely, if an officer has made a professional errorâ€”a mistake that has to be disclosed to defense counsel and may rightly be the subject of cross-examinationâ€”that does not necessarily mean they cannot ever be called as a witness again; that situation requires full constitutional disclosures, trial preparation, close supervision, and better training going forward.","Effectively prosecuting repeat offenders is the cornerstone of my plan to reduce violent crime. Here's what I will do different: 

1. Match community policing with community prosecution. Instead of having units and divisions dedicated to different offenses, prosecutors should first be organized by police district, so they learn the neighborhoods, the patrol officers, the street intelligence, and the gangs and individual characters driving violence in the neighborhoods where they handle cases. 
2. Develop proactive gang prosecutions focused on communities most ravaged by violent crime. Currently, prosecutions in the State's Attorney's Office are entirely reactive. It wasn't always that way. In 2014, my unit alone brought a dozen multi-defendant cases. In the past three years, the current State's Attorney has brought one. Those cases made a big difference in places like Barclay and Cherry Hill, leading to dramatic reductions in violent crime. 
3. Build better cases, with a special focus on high-impact prosecutions like gun crimes, burglaries, and carjackings. Prosecutors cannot focus only on cases for the cameras. There are thousands of important cases where violent repeat offenders are enjoying the windfall of an unwarranted dismissal or a botched prosecution. 
4. Involve prosecutors in developing comprehensive reentry plans for individuals who are at greatest risk of becoming victims or perpetrators of gun violence. To shut the revolving door of prison, prosecutors have to pay attention not only when a violent repeat offender commits his latest offense, but also as they are returning to Baltimore before they commit their next crime.","To make sure the public can hold us accountable, I have pledged to create the most transparent prosecutor's office in American history. Here is what that will look like:

First, we will release 100-day plans every 100 days. At the end of each 100 days, we will release a report on what we have accomplished and where work remains. Those reports will include an analysis of key indicators including, for example, felony conviction rates, rates of dismissed cases, homicide clearance rates, average sentences by offense, and the rate of remand for juveniles charged as adults.

Second, each week, we will make available online a downloadable index of resolved and pending cases so the public can see for itself the status of cases and how cases have been resolved. 

Finally, to give the public additional insights about how cases are investigated and prosecuted, for certain cases of public importance (e.g., police-involved fatalities), we will permit, with certain conditions, a member of the media to be embedded in the investigation.

We cannot diagnose what is wrong without data and transparency; we cannot see where we are making progress and where we are falling short without public accountability; and we cannot restore the public's faith in the criminal justice system unless the public believes we have nothing to hide and that our primary interest is the common good.
","There is lot of work to be done in the long term to restore the community's faith in criminal justice. Returning to a community prosecution model, which was dismantled by the current State's Attorney, will help. So will securing additional funding from federal, state, and local sources to assist witnesses with trauma counseling, relocation, substance abuse treatment, etc. But more funding is the beginning, not the end, of the solution. Witnesses will not come forward if they are not convinced that the leap of faith we are asking them to make is worth it, that the cases in which they are agreeing to testify are not going to be carelessly dropped or routinely lost at trial. We have to do better in court if we are going to ask for more from our witnesses. Prosecutors also have to learn how to build relationships and earn the trust of witnesses, so that witnesses know they will be treated with respect and that their fears are being taken seriously. As a prosecutorâ€”at the federal, state, and city levelâ€”a reluctant witness was nothing unusual. But, in partnership with law enforcement, we gained their trust. One witness at a time, one case at a time. Fighting crime is a marathon and a sprint. While we cannot lose sight of the long-term work that must be done, training prosecutors to immediately earn the trust of individuals in the community is also part of what we must do.","I am a proven prosecutor and the only candidate who has been a prosecutor at the city, state, and federal level, serving most recently as Deputy Attorney General of Maryland. Unlike my opponentsâ€”who have primarily been on the criminal defense and civil litigation sideâ€”I am also the only candidate who has personally tried murder, wiretap, and gang cases as a prosecutor. I also have the boldest and most concrete plans, along with the experience and track record to get it done. I'm the only candidate who has pledged to cut murders in half in three years and to end cash bail, mandatory minimum sentences, and the school-to-prison pipeline. I know what worksâ€”we did it before when we achieved the lowest crime rates in decades, and we can do it again. No other candidate has as much management experience, nor the crucial personal relationships with key federal partners and law enforcement agencies. Finally, Baltimore is in my blood. I am the only candidate who is from Baltimore, the proud product of local public schools who became president of the Harvard Law Review, whose parents devoted their lives to public service in Baltimore, and whose own career has been dedicated to public safety here.
