Our schools are among the best in the state, but we cannot expect our students to excel if they do not have a safe and secure learning environment. We currently have school resource officers (SROs) in all 12 of our high schools and three SROs available to our middle schools. In my FY 2019 budget, I will be including funding for additional SROs for our middle schools.   Working with the HCPSS, the Howard County Police Department is conducting regular ""foot patrols"" in our schools, focusing primarily on the schools that currently do not have a SRO.  These actions will not only serve to better protect our students and teachers, but will also continue our community policing efforts.   In this day and age, schools face a range of safety threats, all of which must be taken seriously and addressed. As County Executive, I have organized my Administration to address both existing and new school safety concerns quickly, and I am proud to say, since the new Superintendent was appointed, we have jointly proposed several new safety measures including new resources to improve security at high schools. On this issue, I believe agility and an open-minded approach to new safety ideas is key. I want the HCPSS community to know, as long as I am County Executive, we will stop at nothing to ensure a safe and secure learning environment in HCPSS facilities.","While I believe that we must continue to look for ways to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of county government, I typically do not promote the privatization of County services.  However, as described below, there are two current examples where the private sector has been invited to participate with government to provide needed public services.   Over the past three years, the County has been investing more public health dollars in community providers who deliver essential health services.  This benefits the County in a number of ways.  First, community providers have the clinical expertise to deliver services more effectively.  Second, more health services are becoming billable to Medicaid, which allows the County dollar to go further.  Third, community providers already understand reimbursement practices to maximize repayments of health services to residents, allowing the County to serve the health needs of a broader spectrum of the population.   In another scenario, the County, under my leadership, is making greater use of Public Private Partnerships to accelerate needed capital projects that have a strong community benefit and alleviate pressures on the capital budget so that the taxpayers' dollars go further.  Two key examples are the construction of a new courthouse that has been sorely needed in Howard County for over 40 years, and the restoration of 60 impervious acres in a single project that will improve the health of the Chesapeake Bay.","When I took office, I made it a priority to have the Adequate Public Facilities Ordinance (APFO) reviewed and strengthened.  APFO was last examined and modified when I served on the County Council in 2002. Therefore, when I established the APFO task force comprising of individuals representing all the stakeholders and including a representative appointed by each of the five council members, it was the first time in 15 years that APFO was carefully evaluated through a transparent, public process.  This review resulted in stronger infrastructure requirements for future developments.   During the County Council consideration of the APFO legislation, the Council adopted an amendment to exempt certain affordable housing projects from the APFO regulations. Considering the high housing prices in Howard County and the need for affordable housing, I believe that the exemption was a reasonable approach.    I  will continue to work with the Board of Education, Howard County Public School System and the Howard County State Delegation to make the revised APFO work for our residents.","No. As County Executive, I vetoed the 2017 proposal (CB9) to make Howard County a ""Sanctuary County"" because that bill neither provided sanctuary to anyone nor helped our public safety officers protect our residents.     Howard County has long been known for valuing diversity, inclusion and civility.  These have been the guiding principles throughout my life and why I have championed efforts such as #OneHoward, and stood up with others in my community against acts of hatred and bigotry. This commitment is demonstrated by the strong partnership that has been forged between the  Howard County Police Department (HCPD) and the Foreign-born Information and Referral Network (FIRN).  This partnership includes having FIRN representatives participate at our police academies and other training activities.  The HCPD participates in many FIRN events which allows the officers to meet with members of our immigrant community.  This commitment extends to all other County agencies where no person is asked about their immigration status unless it is required by federal or state law.      The HCPD does not enforce immigration laws.  However, to prohibit our police from working with the federal government in certain situations could seriously hinder our efforts to stop crimes such as child pornography, human trafficking and gang violence.  This is consistent with actions taken during the prior administration when Howard County was successful in locating, arresting and prosecuting MS-13 gang members.  Consequently, I do believe such cooperation is in the best interest of our residents to promote public safety.","After July 30, 2016, my Administration began an unprecedented effort to evaluate the Tiber-Hudson Watershed in a holistic manner through a comprehensive Hydrologic and Hydraulic analysis that examined what measures could be taken to make Ellicott City more resilient to future flooding. The results from this analysis identified four priority projects, consisting of three large retention facilities and a better conveyance system through the town. Once these projects were identified, my Administration began pursuing them and is continuing to work toward their implementation with key partners at the state and federal level.  My Administration also commissioned the US Army Corps of Engineers to prepare a floodproofing study that would inform property owners what measures they could take to fortify their buildings from future flooding. We will continue to work with property owners to implement key recommendations. In addition, we will also continue to help inform property owners about flood insurance opportunities. In fact, due to recent efforts throughout the County, FEMA upgraded our community rating system which will provide further relief to property owners that participate in the National Flood Insurance Program through lower insurance premiums.  Studies have shown that every $1 spent on mitigation saves $6-$7 in the response. With that in mind, I will continue to focus our efforts in continuing to make Ellicott City a resilient community.","My Administration has developed a four-pronged approach to addressing the opioid epidemic:  prevention; treatment; recovery; and adjudication.  All of our appropriate County agencies have been deployed to address the growing number of non-fatal and fatal overdoses, and to prevent future overdoses.  We have built effective partnerships with Howard County General Hospital and treatment providers to increase access to treatment, and have worked collaboratively with other jurisdictions in Maryland to share in best practices and integrate efforts to maximize the impact of our interventions.  This crisis will be an evolutionary battle that cannot be combated in a finite period of time.  In addition to the above, it will be important to destigmatize addiction so that people can feel safe when interacting with law enforcement or while seeking treatment.    I remain committed to building a complete system of care in Howard County, which includes establishing an in-patient drug treatment facility for residents regardless of what type of health insurance they may have.  The building blocks to this system continue to be positioned so that Howard County can act quickly and responsibly to all individuals struggling with addiction, no matter where they fall on the spectrum.","Over the past three years, we have worked diligently to improve a dilapidated bus network that suffered from an aging fleet and an outdated route structure that had not been examined for close to a decade. We have been able to tackle both issues through replacing a significant number of buses, and by establishing a review process for the current routes that included significant input from the community. That review culminated in a Transit Development Plan that will guide how to adjust our routes over the next five years so that we are more effectively getting people where they need and want to go. These efforts are transforming an unreliable system into one that Howard County residents deserve and can trust.  We have also worked to improve other modes of transportation, including biking. After this summer, we will have more than tripled the amount of bike lanes from when I took office. I have also crafted BikeHoward Express which will provide a network of nearly 50 miles of bicycle infrastructure in the core of the county over the next three years. The FY19 budget contains the largest single year investment ever dedicated to bicycle infrastructure in our history.  It is my goal to provide our community with more improved transportation options through a context-sensitive complete streets approach, and the actions we have taken over the past three years have put our community on track to achieving this goal.","I am always open to new fiscal tools that enable us to keep the tax burden on Howard County taxpayers as low as possible.  For example, my Administration has made innovative use of tax credits, such as credits to benefit seniors,  members of our military and public safety officers. However, as County Executive, it is also my responsibility to provide prudent financial management of county revenues and expenses so that our AAA bond rating and long-term fiscal health stay intact for the foreseeable future.  With respect to zero-based budgeting, Howard County has a strong track record of passing balanced budgets every year that do not compromise services to residents.  I see no need for Howard County to change its budgeting practices at this time when the system is working as evidenced by 21 consecutive years of AAA bond ratings.","What are your views on the use of tax-increment financing as an incentive for private building and redevelopment projects, including remodeling blighted village centers in Columbia?","With rising concern over school safety, should county police officers or sheriff’s deputies be assigned to all public schools, along with additional screening methods, such as metal detectors, student pat-downs and clear backpacks?",Are there any county government services that should be privatized to save money and improve efficiency?,Is a provision in the county’s recently adopted Adequate Public Facilities Ordinance that allows developers to build affordable housing in areas where a building moratorium is in place a responsible approach?,Is it appropriate for Howard to be a “sanctuary county” and prohibit county police from reporting detainees in the county detention center to federal authorities?,"What efforts, if any, should Howard County take to install more flood-control systems in and around Ellicott City, and how many tax dollars should be involved?",How would you respond to the opiod overdose epidemic?

Based upon the information provided to the Council, by the County Executive's staff regarding Downtown Columbia Tax-Increment Finance (TIF), I thought it prudent to call for an independent evaluation and ask our auditor to look at the data.  There was a reasonable case made that without the TIF, we would not have as a high a quality of a downtown without it.  Unfortunately, the TIF legislation that was sent to us by our Republican County Executive needed significant strengthening and work.  I am also glad that, with my Council Colleagues, we showed leadership by creating an Memorandum of Understanding with the developer and extracted more community benefit.  If we have a transparent community conversation about making an investment, via TIF, that will help grow revenue and revitalize neighborhoods, I'm supportive. I have concerns, however, if backroom deals are made without a transparent, open process or if the TIF isn't really needed. I grew concerned that after the Council passed the much improved legislation, the County Executive unilaterally changed the use of a majority of the money without even discussing it with the public or every member of the Council. That's not a transparent process and, if the TIF is not needed for what the administration said, then that should have been communicated to the public.","As a father with two children in our public schools, I know we all want our schools to be safe for teaching and learning.  We should first evaluate the data to see best practices to ensure safety, then have a public, transparent community conversation about our findings, and finally discuss next steps as well as how those steps fit within all of our priorities.  What best practices and types of training should be considered to maximize partnership and success between law enforcement and the school community?  We shouldn't forget the root causes of school safety concerns including the proliferation of guns and the ease by which some young people can access them.  We should integrate restorative practices system wide as well as increase pupil personnel workers, school counselors, social workers, school psychologists, health assistants and bus attendants.  Those staff additions will make a large impact on ensuring every school is a safe, nurturing place to teach and learn. We also need to take a closer look at class size and makeup.  Overcrowded classes with too many students in any given class with increased need, that raises the stress and anxiety level for everyone.  We should assess the cost and logistics of the various ways to increase school safety, before they are announced via a press conference. The vision and way forward should be communicated to the community early in the process so that we all have an opportunity to be a part of the solution.","I think we should do an assessment of what services can be privatized, how well the current services are being delivered, how privatization would impact our community--as far as cost, accountability, quality of services, working conditions for employees, as well as how innovation and creativity are or can be used to ensure that we are the example of what can be.  Once all of the information is collected, there should be a discussion with government employees as well as the public so that everyone is able to offer thoughts, ideas, and suggestions. I think we should be fiscally responsible and hold true to our values, including working hard for hard working people. We need to be an example for efficiency and effectiveness as well as compassion and quality working conditions.","While I am a strong proponent of ensuring a full spectrum of affordable housing in our community I have concerns about this recently added provision.  First, but for an issue with the calendar, the way the legislation was passed in 2017 would have been law.  That legislation was as a result of almost six months of public conversation with the Council and almost two years with the County Executive.  Also, the Adequate Public Facilities Ordinance was about ensuring adequate public facilities.  When we are facing school overcrowding, congested roads, long waits in the emergency room, and other quality of life issues adversely impacted by poor growth management, a last minute amendment in February to allow developers to build more housing where there are insufficient public facilities was something I could not support. That said, the legislation as passed is significantly better than what was filed by our Republican County Executive.","Immigration law enforcement is under the purview of the federal government.  That cannot and should not be changed via local law.  At a time when the President of the United States continues to divide us through his anti-immigrant rhetoric and is not being fiscally responsible with our taxpayer dollars, leading to cuts to important things like education, the arts, and the environment, we should not be taking local dollars to use for immigration enforcement.  We need more money for education, to grow the economy, improve our environment, and invest in our infrastructure.  I am opposed to racial profiling, which is usually how enforcement begins. I am opposed to policies which increase fear from our neighbors, who may be undocumented or love someone who is undocumented. It is very concerning that while some undocumented residents are afraid to report crime or abuse because of how President Trump is handling the immigration issue, instead of standing up for our County, our Republican County Executive tows the Party line by suggesting that all undocumented immigrants are gang members or somehow dangerous, yet still implements some modified sanctuary county policies.  According to the data from numerous reports, the vast majority of undocumented immigrants, a higher percentage than of citizens, actually commit less crime and work harder, using fewer resources, because they do not want to alert anyone to their citizenship status.  We should be a place that is compliant with the rule of law, as well as a beacon of compassion, empathy, and justice.","One of the first battles I had to have with our Republican County Executive was to keep the storm water remediation fee, which ensures millions of dollars to address this issue. He proposed eliminating that revenue source with no realistic funding plan to ensure flood control would be a priority. It's irresponsible to cut funding to storm water remediation when we need to repair our existing storm water system, increase the number and size of our underground storm water pipes, increase development and capital projects that combine increased storm water capacity and urban design, including in revitalization projects.  In fact, we should be investing more in programs like the Restoring the Environment and Developing Youth Program (READY) to create more living wage jobs and meet our storm water management responsibilities. We need to help educate and support retrofitting existing buildings to help mitigate flood damage including expanding flood proofing projects on private property. One of the most important things the next County Executive can do is to work with the Historic Ellicott City Flood Workgroup's recommendations of funding all Phase I and  Phase II mitigation projects as well as ensure FEMA keeps Howard County at the top of their list of priorities!","Drug addiction and the challenges surrounding it are not new.  However, with it spreading across every group regardless of where people live, what they look like, how many degrees they have, or how much money they earn, it has grabbed the attention of elected officials at every level. This public health crisis should be addressed by: expanding drug takeback/drop off availability; increased education about medication storage; more naloxone training and distribution, research into better pain management systems and strategies; and improved awareness of addiction to help people recognize the signs and minimize the stigma so that we can all do a better job of helping our neighbors in need. While I am supportive of in-patient treatment, the funding, location, and construction needs should be carefully evaluated before moving forward with a specific plan. We need to always demonstrate our humanity and help remind our neighbors and loved ones who fall victim of this epidemic that there is a way back.","Howard County should be a model for safely biking, walk, or taking public transportation. Unfortunately, we have one of the worst transportation systems in the region.  The lack of focus and investment in public transportation adversely impacts our economic development competitiveness, traffic and road congestion, the ability for people to travel for work or other needed services, and the ability to consider healthier options of travel.  We have fallen behind other jurisdictions in Maryland and even in the region in recent years and need to invest much more in public transportation. This is an issue that impacts the health, economics, and quality of life for all of Howard County. If we are serious about ensuring Howard County is the best place to live, work, or play for all and not merely overall, transportation needs to become a priority again.","One of the first things the next County Executive should do is evaluate all taxes and fees.  How do we compare with current and aspirational peer counties?  Are we managing our revenue stream as effectively as possible to meet our needs and reflect our values?   Are there more efficient ways to manage taxpayer dollars?  How can we ensure that special interests, like developers, pay their fair share to help make our quality of life excellent? I suspect after that analysis we may find that some taxes and fees residents pay should be lowered.  While I definitely do not support raising the constant yield property tax rate at this time, I would need to wait until I review the data from the comprehensive tax and fee evaluation to assess what, how much it should be lowered. As far as Zero Based budgeting, while I strongly support clear, transparent justification for how taxpayer dollars are spent, because of how I believe annual funding should have a certain level of predictability and move forward a vision, I do not support the County implementing a zero-based budgeting scheme.","What are your views on the use of tax-increment financing as an incentive for private building and redevelopment projects, including remodeling blighted village centers in Columbia?","With rising concern over school safety, should county police officers or sheriff’s deputies be assigned to all public schools, along with additional screening methods, such as metal detectors, student pat-downs and clear backpacks?",Are there any county government services that should be privatized to save money and improve efficiency?,Is a provision in the county’s recently adopted Adequate Public Facilities Ordinance that allows developers to build affordable housing in areas where a building moratorium is in place a responsible approach?,Is it appropriate for Howard to be a “sanctuary county” and prohibit county police from reporting detainees in the county detention center to federal authorities?,"What efforts, if any, should Howard County take to install more flood-control systems in and around Ellicott City, and how many tax dollars should be involved?",How would you respond to the opiod overdose epidemic?
