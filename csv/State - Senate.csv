Chairman of Procurement Council for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce","I continue to be a strong supporter of the work of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence (The Kirwan Commission). It is building on the visionary work of the Commission on Education Finance Equity and Excellence (The Thornton Commission). I support the 9 drivers or building blocks on which the Commission's recommendations are based. The Kirwan Commission, like the Thornton Commission, has broad support across the state across party, race, and geography, and has the potential, with proper innovation, accountability and funding, to move Maryland back to number one in national educational performance rankings. The task before us is urgent and we must move decisively to provide high quality education for the approximately 900,000 public school students in our 24 school systems. We must address the adequacy funding gap that is impacting 20 of 24 of our school districts. Funding for public education has been relatively flat since 2009, notwithstanding the Thornton Formula. An important ingredient in achieving this objective is state and local leadership that can build the political consensus that will be required to gain passage of the Commission's recommendations. I will work to ensure that there is equal access to high quality programs and services, adequate and equitable funding for public education with innovation and strict and systemic accountability. I take seriously the requirement of the Maryland Constitution that: ""The General Assembly…shall by Law establish throughout the State a thorough and efficient System of Free Public Schools; and shall provide by taxation, or otherwise, for their maintenance.","Transportation is essential to ensuring opportunity for the working poor (BaltimoreLink) and making sure that our State is prepared for future economic growth.  The State has nearly a $4 Billion transportation budget.  The updated Consolidated Transportation Plan (CTP) starting in FY18 focuses on structurally deficient bridges.  We need a data-driven process however to help the State prioritize funding for projects that will yield the greatest public benefit.  Baltimore has specific needs for example around improving the Howard Street Bridge.  The success of this project impacts the future prospects of the Baltimore Port - it's directly related to the port's capacity for accommodating stacked shipping containers.  If the Port can't accommodate these shipping containers, then business opportunities will go elsewhere.  We are fortunate in Maryland to have one of the lowest rates of structurally deficient bridges.  Only 67 out nearly 2,600 bridges are deemed deficient in Maryland.   By statue Baltimore receives about 80 percent of Highway User Revenue (HUR) and an additional $5 Million for capital needs.  It's not quite enough to fully update MTA's fleet of buses and light rail.  We need an infrastructure bill, one that combines federal and state resources, to help address regional transit and road needs.  The State received a $10 Million TIGER grant from the US Department of Transportation to support BaltimoreLink – it's a start and an example of a promising state-federal partnership.","I support the further study of this issue.  We need ""smart-on-crime"" approaches that pushes back on the failed, draconian war on drugs approach that have locked away too many citizens.","I would need to do further research on this issue, but I do value the restoration of the Chesapeake Bay. It's a staple part of Maryland, and we cannot continue to allow the marine life to suffer as it has.",We should continue to look at ways to support the establishment of reinsurance pools to help control costs for insurers and to stabilize the insurance market place.,"I believe the state first needs to understand the history of Baltimore. A task force should do a 30+ year historical assessment of violent crime (or use those already done by sociologists and other social science PhD's as Baltimore has been a frequent case study), focusing on the communities most affected by violent crime and understanding the sources and underlying causes.  Once assessed, there needs to be a focus on key target areas of economic investment and holistic community outreach/development through some of the following channels: school investment, housing developments,  and especially counseling/mental health centers as many individuals involved in violent crime have suffered from their own forms of trauma that went unnoticed and unassisted or are coming from situations that most individuals cannot comprehend.  I believe violent crime is a symptom of a much greater issue. I will work to make sure that the state helps usher in an era of smart on crime approaches that invest in schools, in economically distressed communities, and that provides an evidenced-based blueprint for support offenders.  I will work at the state level to help find a better way for formerly incarcerated Baltimore citizens to lead a productive, economic life after prison as well to decrease recidivism which also leads to crime as many individuals are barred from all aspects of civilian life after incarceration.","Overall, a strong business climate right now. I believe from surveys and research I've been able to look at, our economy is well positioned moving forward into the future. I believe we need to do continual increases in technology and STEM based jobs and continue to focus on growing our cyber security as the leader of it in the nation.  I also believe, we need to look at and embrace the minimum wage increases to a living wage. We also need to invest in entrepreneurs around the entire state.","Yes.  We have one of the most gerrymandered districts in the United States in Maryland's Congressional Third District. I support the creation of a non-partisan or equally bi-partisan, body to draw the legislative and congressional district maps after each census if they are first fully aware of how the drawing of legislative and district maps have been used historically to gerrymander communities of color and other marginalized groups and vow against this practice. I believe prior to the legislative maps being finalized that they should even be brought before a non-partisan, diverse body of constituents, to ensure that the redistricting is fair to those most vulnerable to unfair redistricting practices. There should be community representatives that are part of this approval system to ensure voices are heard and thorough vetting of all possible ways to map out territories.","I believe that the Officers Bill of Rights needs to be reviewed thoroughly because it is a broad bill, as we have to maintain accountability of those that are called to serve the community are transparent in their interactions with the community they are serving. We need clear practices of accountability to ensure all actions of law enforcement are being reviewed to ensure they are living up to their commitment to serve the public, especially in  communities of color.  It does need to be changed to ensure people are both protected, but more importantly, know that the police have their best interest at heart. We have to rebuild trust that has been broken for decades due to a lack of transparency, swift communication, care, and compassion. We have to ensure that the law protects the people as much as it protects officers. These issues are too important to continue to fall by the way-side.",We need to understand how this became a crisis and remind ourselves that people don't want to be addicted to opioids as we work this out.,"As the next state Senator from the 23rd District, I will be a strong supporter of initiatives that are designed to remove all barriers to income equality between men and women. Unequal pay based on gender affects not only the woman, but their families and the communities in which they live. It affects their quality of life during the working period and retirement. I support the Equal Pay Act (EPA), which requires that men and women in the same workplace be given equal pay for equal work. I support the administrative and judicial remedies that extend from the Act and empower individuals harmed by unequal pay. I will support the aggressive enforcement of Title VII, which makes it illegal to discriminate based on sex in pay and benefits. I will also be a strong voice for the enforcement of non-discrimination provisions of Title VII, the ADEA, and the ADA, which prohibit compensation discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or disability. The enforcement initiatives must go hand-in-hand with programs that are designed to ensure that female students have access to equal high quality professional and vocational education and training in diverse fields that lead to highly compensated employment positions. I am pleased to see the sea change that is occurring in our culture (the Me-Too movement) that is helping empower women in all segments of our society, especially in the workplace involving the integrity of working environment.",It's important to review the fees charged particularly how we handle public longitudinal data systems center.

I was a third of the way into an MBA in Accounting when 9/11 happened and I joined the Navy. I graduated in top of my class at Officer Candadidate School, then went through flight school and earned my wings as a Naval Flight Officer. Once in the fleet, I received graduate level training at the Airborne Mission Commander Course in Fallon, NV, and at the School of Aviation Safety in Pensacola, FL.","I am a Certifed QuickBooks ProAdvisor and owner of a full-service business bookkeeping and consulting business.

After entering the Navy Reserve, I started my own business helping small businesses use QuickBooks to make their digital bookkeeping match reality. I am also on the board of several nonprofits - March On, March On Maryland, Maryland NORML, and The Milky Way Foundation.","The Kirwan Commission produced a report that is an excellent guide to begin the process of improving our state education system. We need to pay our teachers, and we need to address the education gap in Maryland. We can start by ensuring that casino revenue be set aside in a special fund for education and fulfill the promise to voters.  I intend to help get the referendum passed in November; we need to send a message from the ballot box to our elected officials that education is our priority.  We need to continue to build awareness about it and make sure people vote on it in November.","Maryland's transportation system is not adequately serving the needs of our growing communities. We need to improve our transit system to ensure that more Marylanders have access to efficient public transportation. Investing in better, cleaner mass transit will lessen the environmental impact of commuters on our state's ecosystem.","64% of Maryland voters support legalization. It's time to listen to the people. I supported the bill in the 2018 legislative session to put legalization on the ballot as a referendum, because many legislators no longer truly represent the people, so it's time for the people to speak on the issue directly and be heard.  And in states with legal marijuana, opioid overdoses are reduced by 25%.",We should immediately take steps to implement the Chesapeake Bay Program at a state level.  We need to track Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL)  and implement Watershed Implementation Plans (WIP). Then we need to fund the programs that will cover the gap.,"I support the development of a universal healthcare system for Marylanders. We can look at a system that we are already paying into as part of the solution. Tricare is the military healthcare system; most of our taxes go to  I believe that we as citizens should have the right to receive TriCare at cost from the Federal Government. The TriCare system is already prepared to provide care for all ages and genders, and I believe we have the right to access that care.","The best way to fighting crime is a multifaceted approach.  By giving people who have no good opportunities a lawful way to survive, would be most effective in the long term.  Revitalizing Baltimore manufacturing centers would provide good paying jobs.  ""Banning the Box""  to allow felons who have paid their debts to society to get a job and not return to an unlawful lifestyle out of need.  Youth outreach would be key, the State should increase funding for community centers, after school, and summer programs to give the youth of Baltimore a safe place to go away from the gangs, and be given the tools and values they need to live in society.   Gang outreach would need to be increased to try and get young men and women out of the gangs for good and become productive members of society.","Maryland is a favorable climate for medium and large corporations. Maryland's small business need a boost. We need to make sure that small businesses have access to the capital that they need to thrive. Maryland can foster cooperation between the banks, larger cooperations and small businesses. Developing agile corporate mentorship programs will boost small businesses will spark innovation and create jobs.  Additionally, we need to make banking laws more friendly towards small business.","Yes, this sounds very reasonable.",Law enforcement officers should be afforded the same protections as all citizens -- officers are NOT above the law. And our criminal justice system must be completely changed and dramatically simplified. We need to have more public visibility to what happens within our justice system. We can begin by including ordinary citizens in the disciplinary hearings.  Too frequently police are called to respond to non-criminal situations and the results can be tragic.  We are incarcerating disproportionate numbers of minorities and the current standards and systems we use including the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights may be contributing significantly to the current criminal justice crisis.,"We have to look at the root causes of addiction, which leads to a multi-pronged strategy: addressing the overprescribing of opioids, increase funding for beds, and finally, we need to practice empathy with logic. The opposite of addiction isn't sobriety; it's connection. I propose that we emulate military organizational structures like the Fleet and Family Support Center, which offers an abundance of services for military members and their families, including every kind of counseling. Bringing communities together, and neighboring ones","Developing educational systems that support workers that deliver value to our economy.  We need to develop more programs for addressing families in transition.  Too often a medical, legal or criminal event can leave a family unbalanced. We need to build back connection in our communities.    We need to implement technical training programs that teach small business innovation through agile industry-based partnerships. Through these programs we can build sustainable communities that are innovative, resilient, and ecologically sound.","Not really, if a developer can get as many waivers for meetings as they need from the local governments.  The open meeting law allows for ""administrative"" but the term is left intentionally vague.  Could issuing a waiver for a developer be considered an administrative function?  As such, is a public hearing needed?

Caretaker and service provider for Montgomery Pet Sitters.","Yes, my experience in citizen lobbying with the Maryland State Education Association has given to me in-depth knowledge that the proposed reforms provided by the Kirwan commission prioritize providing quality education and equity programs to the most vulnerable communities, where the quality of life is poorest, and increase the quality of education by providing more teachers and higher salaries for them as many are underpaid despite their union protections. The direct funding lockbox to the casino revenues as was originally promised in the 2012 referendum was a great start in this year's commitment to funding the education budget and reforms, and the same thing can be done for marijuana sales if the substance is legalized. Furthermore, reforms to reduce administrative overhead, which many teachers I know support since they say their aides are poorly trained and don't help much while their administrative offices continue to be non-responsive to their requests, can open more of the budget for the needed program funding.","In my opinion Maryland favors roads too much, and not even in the right way. My county of Montgomery alone blew a majority of its transportation budget building new county highways instead of maintaining the roads already in place, and now struggle to repave both the old and the new because of budget constraints while our public transit continues to decline in quality and, in effect, ridership. Because of the way it spent its transportation funds in the past, and the amount of needed upgrades to transportation infrastructure now, some things will have to be prioritized if we want to keep transit as public as possible. We'll have to make smart choices, starting with the most cost-effective improvements that cover the most people like BRT systems or MARC commuter expansions for areas of decentralized population.  As for the BaltimoreLink, mixed reviews have come through, though I suspect some of the negativity stems from years of general mistrust of the MTA to do its job properly. I would suggest taking the overhaul and transition process more seriously at the input of the public if it is to be effective, and keep in mind that the Red Line extension offered something that BaltimoreLink did not, more access to commuter routes to and from the DC and Virginia area. In conclusion, I'm leaning towards transit authority and administration could and probably should do more to accommodate Baltimore's transit needs.","Yes. There are at least three major benefits to the legalization of marijuana, both medical and recreational. First, it opens the door to a new industry, and more industries mean more tax revenue for funding state programs and projects, which is sorely needed as our state continues to face the prospects of cuts due to budget deficits. Second, it addressed criminal justice reform as there are quite a few people locked up for merely processing a single bag. With it legal, fewer Marylanders will have criminal records hampering their job opportunities and restricting their rights and access to helpful programs, and prisons will cost the taxpayers less since there will be fewer prisoners to contain. Third, it directly fights the opioid crisis by acting as a non-lethal substitute for painkillers. Medical studies have shown you literally cannot die by marijuana intoxication alone. In fact, you cannot technically overdose marijuana period because THC is not even absorbed through the brain stem like opioids are.","Maryland must make a commitment to achieving a zero-waste status to reduce pollution into the bay and lessen the costs of cleanup and recovery projects. The reforms necessary for this goal will have to include a transition to 100% renewable energy, modernizing the grid to be energy efficient, adoption of sustainable farming practices, expansion of food recovery networks, statewide bans of certain plastics and chemicals, container deposit legislation, implementation of rain collection and biowaste digester/composter projects, and mass-transit infrastructure building.  Everyone will have to do their part to make this a reality, but especially the industries themselves must be held accountable for environmental damage cost they shift to the taxpayers and workers. It'll be an uphill battle, but once achieved, it will give Maryland and its natural treasures not only environmental health, but economic resilience through self sustainability.","I would work with other state legislators and the governor to get the required waivers from the federal government to implement a state single-payer system, as outlined by gubernatorial candidate Ben Jealous in his 19 page healthcare plan. And while we're fighting, I would work to reinforce and expand what negotiating power the state already has with its waiver to implement the all-payer model, which fixes all hospital operations at a set rate so clients are not overcharged and overhead cost is reduced. If the viability of creating a state public option presents itself, if only to cover the uninsured as Rich Madaleno suggests, I would also not hesitate to support it, but would emphasize the fight for the state waivers or to pressure a national universal healthcare model must continue in full force.","Drug reform policy is a big must as trends have shown that the criminalization of abusive substances only leads to more severe actions and consequences on the whole, not to mention they're ineffective as their main targets, addicts, flat out ignore them as the fear of violence and incarceration does not overcome their cravings. And while I am in favor of background checks for gun reform, the sad truth is the highest number of fatalities that come from gun violence are contributed by the police. Despite the reforms pushed for since the infamous Freddie Gray shooting several years back, little has changed other than the BPD being caught in the act more often. Body cams catch evidence planting, unarmed shootings, various forms of corruption, yet accountability is rarely established on the whole. It's my belief that how the law enforcement system is structured in Baltimore drives many on the force to look for trouble and assume the worst. Arrest quotas, supplying the department with military-grade surplus, little to no enforcement of protocol, they're all incentives for the police to seek escalation of conflict in most situations. In addition to stopping these bad habits, public disclosure of official policies and procedure for the department as well as a requirement for deescalating training for all members of the force must be established to improve public relations and trust, because a lack of it creates tension on both sides.","Because of its proximity to numerous federal institutions on the south end, and wealth of universities and hospitals, Maryland holds a relatively stable climate with one of highest percentages of educated workforce in the nation, with room to hire in their major hubs. However, because many tech firms and superstores place their businesses in northern Virginia, there are dangerous arguments that Maryland should lower its corporate tax rate to be competitive with its neighbor. Combine that with the recent bidding war for Amazon's new HQ along with few distinctions of regulations between small and large companies, and I conclude a majority of Maryland leaders are too focused on getting outside business and their workforce to move in instead of building up local businesses run by already existing residents, a troubling recipe for economic unsustainability if you ask me. The state of Maryland can shift its focus to growing its own family businesses back home with a combination of equity programs for startups, tax and business regulatory reforms to accommodate companies with a smaller workforce, close corporate loopholes and enact stronger state union laws to protect workers from income inequality, and most importantly create a state jobs program for areas of need like infrastructure and environment to decrease unemployment numbers.","Of course. It saddens me to know that Democrats are willing to play just as underhanded as Republicans do if they get the chance to redraw the lines in their favor. It creates a misrepresentation of the general populace in government, and gives liberals no real legs to stand on when they complain how their conservative opponents rig the vote in their favor. I was swapped along with a good chunk of Montgomery county from district 8 to 6 just to defeat Republican incumbent Roscoe Bartlett, and all that did was raise partisan attacks across the state that limited thoughtful debate, which resulted in contributing to Larry Hogan's election as governor 2 years later when he championed an independent redistricting committee. On an additional note, I also point out that while the Maryland state constitution defines the parameters with how its legislative districts are drawn, it does not define congressional districts, giving the redistricters much more leeway on how to draw them. So I would not only support an independent redistricting committee, but work to amend our state constitution to have congressional district adhere to the same restrictions that legislative districts do as well.","While the LEOBoR's intent was to ensure the same due process for a police officer as a civilian, I believe the bill fails to take into account what resources and abilities an officer and his/her department have available to use that a civilian does not when accused of a criminal action. Moreover, there are provisions included that analysts conclude provide extra protections not covered by the original bill of rights, such as the purging of complaints and investigation records after a few years. Given the lack of accountability of Balitmore's police force, I would wager to say there is at least some grounds to accuse officers taking unfair advantage of these protections when possible. Changes should be made that hold an officer to be more responsible of the position he/she holds, at the very least the extra protections should be eschewed if an officer is really to hold equal footing to a civilian on investigation. I would also promote more civilian involvement in keeping investigations and reviews transparent by passing legislation to establish requirements that build more citizen review boards in areas that do not have any and strengthening the impartiality and abilities of existing ones.","As explained in questions 12 and 9, decriminalization of abusive substances and legalization of recreational marijuana both contribute to ending the opioid epidemic as less money is spent on incarceration and punishment of drug offenders as a result, and instead can be used to expand detox and rehabilitation clinics and programs. Another thing to do would be to regulate the prices and oversee the distribution of prescription medication statewide as it is within the state's power to do so. Many opioid additions start when clinics overprescribe opioid medication, and when the prescriptions become to costly to afford in poorer circles, people turn to more cheaper and unrefined opioids like heroin. Oversight committees  with citizen participation would ensure physicians don't overcharge or oversell opioid prescriptions just to increase their profit margin and inadvertently create addicts. Additionally, prioritizing preventive healthcare more would reduce the need of introducing painkillers like opioids to people in the first place. That means making sure there are enough doctors, nurses, and clinics available for regular visits, and implementing healthcare policies that make the cost of regular checkups affordable to everyone.","First, a statewide increase to the minimum wage must be implemented as living wage studies from various universities show the current minimum, $9.25, is actually at poverty levels for some families in Maryland when factoring in the costs of living. And while $15, over a period of adjustment to protect smaller businesses, would be an increase that covers most individuals across the state, current service and tax rates would still put quite a few households in the red. As such, a tax reform that indexes wages to lower the cost of affordable living for poorer communities, and at the same time closes corporate loopholes to ensure richer communities pay their fair share and make up lost revenue for funding the state's public programs must follow suit immediately with the wage increase if not at the same time. Additionally, many of those on the poorer end of the income spectrum have professions in labor. So increasing labor protections in the state(like a Workers Bill of Rights) will ensure workers have the benefits, fair scheduling, organization, and training/education to make their livelihoods more affordable and reasonably comfortable.","While the Public Information Act in Maryland has been through reforms for the first time in decades in 2015, many institutions continue to use outdated and overbloated administration and bureaucracy to invalidate and/or withhold indefinitely public requests to their records, one of the most prime examples being education budget and staff records. The Montgomery County Civic Federation has many members that have been attempting to get information from the county's board of education and superintendent in order to address administrative inaction to hold student abusers accountable, but have been stonewalled at every turn. The open meetings laws are not strong enough yet either, as local boards and councils can use the same tactics to say they were not given enough notice or claim information pertaining to the meeting's topic is either too sensitive to be discussed to the public body, or is an exemption that does not fall in any of the public body's functions. Bottom line, while the PIA and open meetings are supposed to bring transparency in principle, there's too much overhead and room for interpretation on the local levels of office to make it streamlined or enforceable. Administrative reforms to cut the bureaucracy and promote direct involvement of the citizen boards in access of information must be implemented, likely from the bottom up if we're to promote autonomy and active participation in communities. But the state can continue to tighten reforms to the PIA and open meeting laws in order to cultivate said climate.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

The prospect of a final report is the key reason that I am running for State Senate in District 34.  I want to be in the Senate to vote for the recommendations.  I would like to amend a couple of provisions that appear in the Preliminary Report if they show up in the final version. First,  specify that existing teachers would receive any benefit of implementation of the recommendations and that the same transitional provisions that apply to administrators would apply to teachers.  Second, eliminate an allowance for reduction in wages for student apprentices to sub-minimum wages.  I concur with the impetus to raise the status of educators and to establish professional pay in order to produce excellent education.","During the Hogan Administration transportation funding has been tilted too far toward roads. The endless construction on Route 22 through Aberdeen has been terribly disruptive for our community, an excessive response to the prospect of BRAC.  It appears that the State has adequate resources to meet its transportation needs if there is a return to emphasis on mass transit.        The General Assembly must restore the Red Line in negotiation with the Governor. The MARC service is a big improvement, but trains need to go to the extent of the northern stations in Aberdeen and Perryville more frequently.  Tourism can be even more profitable for MD if the service brings people from all stations into Baltimore and Washington on weekends.  The current 4:20 and 9:30 departures from Washington to Martin State Airport are too limiting.        The Baltimore Link certainly helps.  I know of District 34 people who commute to Annapolis, Owings Mills and Prince George's County.

It should continue to fill in where the  federal government fails temporarily until the country elects a more progressive administration.,"Fund better schools.  Develop a more comprehensive urban Extension Service to assist families with nutrition understanding, child care, health protocols, home care and maintenance and budgeting.  Maintain gun control initiatives that have been passed. Develop better rehabilitation in prisons.  Investigate the prison guard system.  Elected officials should use the bully pulpit to raise the moral climate in the community.  Establish norms that diminish police brutality. Put a lot more neighborhood emphasis on community mediation training.  Develop neighborhood crime watch programs more.","Maryland's business climate is lively.  The state can fund better schools and apply equity levers to improve education  throughout the state.  The state can raise the minimum wage and extend the reach of prevailing wage through its purchase of goods and services.  The state can foster further enhancement of the quality of life through the arts, cultural centers and academic hubs.  Satellites of existing cultural entities can extend these quality of life benefits to underserved areas.  Expanding recreational opportunities using our existing natural resources would help as I did when a county council member by opening up lost public landings for access to waterways and approaching the federal government under a joint use agreement with the Department of the Interior to open access to the Bay.  People who locate businesses are looking for a talented work force and indicia of a high quality of life.","No.  I support a body that includes executive branch and legislative leaders as well as diverse community representatives.  Any ""blue ribbon commission"" is not exempt from political considerations.  I would like to see more public hearings throughout the state to allow citizens to come forward to define communities of interest.","No.  The limitations on who may allege police brutality need to be opened up to more potential reporters. The availability of video and sound recordings should be accommodated. The 90 day statute of limitations for reporting is too short.  Other places in the same law have a one year interval.   References to reasonable hours are vague as are the references to alternate places for interrogation.  They undermine the heart of the restrictions.  The potential for the chief to increase a panel recommendation of penalty is dubious.  That needs study.  A single hearing officer instead of a panel is also questionable.  How many days until a hearing is no longer prompt - another vague provision. Several offices should be removed from the exempt list, such as a person who serves at the pleasure of the Police Commissioner of Baltimore City.","Extend family leave for birth and illness of children. Fund better schools.  Provide safe after school care. Change the high school daily schedule to start and end later, such as 9:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Rehabilitate people who have been convicted of crimes.  Call for stricter review of doctors who overprescribe.  Train a broader segment of the population in emergency antidote procedures with the assistance of fire companies.  Develop senior center and teen center programming  links.",Raise the minimum wage.  Legislate an end to gender and minority bias in pay.   Fund better schools.  Strengthen community college offerings and provide more financial aid to students.  Change the culture that fosters fulltime work at the same time as fulltime student enrollment.  The dual load cannot be carried effectively.  Stop corporate giveaways with public money.,"No.  The present provision for a government to take up to 30 days to respond to a Public Information Request is too long.  The current loophole to allow local and municipal governments to have closed meetings concerning real estate purchase and sale is too broad.  It appears that there is too  much pressure to stifle debate and present a united front in public sessions concerning real estate to the detriment of the citizens.  Conference committees of the General Assembly are not subject to the Open Meetings Law so far as I know, and they should be.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

I supported and helped pass laws to create an Education Lock Box that will require Casino revenues to go only support, not supplant education funding and to have a new Interagency Commission on School Construction that will provide effective processes for obtaining increased school construction funding for local jurisdictions.  This session, I supported legislation to invest $6.5 billion in K-12 education and to fully fund the Geographic Cost of Education Index, while injecting $11.4 million to fund the Kirwan Commission's interim recommendations.","We need to increase funding for mass transit and the repair and improvement of infrastructures.   The funding and efforts to overhaul the bus system must produce  service that is efficient, reliable, safe and affordable.  We need to review and assess those efforts to ensure their goals are achieved.  We also need to support the Red Line, which will ensure individuals can get to work, home, school and other places,  connect vibrant communities, and reduce congestion and pollution.  This is an investment in our community that will enable people to have greater access to transportation, thereby creating more opportunities,  jobs, and state revenues while increasing the quality of their lives.","We have to review and learn from the experiences in states allowing legalization.  If the voters approve legalization via ballot, it should be regulated and taxed and the revenues used for funding education, health care, transportation, environment, other important priorities.","I have and will continue to support increased funding for the Chesapeake Bay Trust Fund,  protect oyster and crab populations, reduce agricultural, animal waste, and pollution runoff, and greenhouse gas emissions, increase Renewal Portfolio Standards, hold companies engaged in offshore oil and gas drilling  strictly liable for economic or environmental damage caused by any spill,  support septic and storm water management and accountability, forest conservation efforts, and applicable state agencies' enforcement activities and programs, require legislative approval before Maryland can withdraw from the US Climate Alliance or the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, and to allow the Attorney General to file suit on our behalf to protect the environment .","I have and will continue to support and pass legislation to increase access to affordable and quality health care and prescription drugs for all Marylanders.  To migitate recent Federal action, I helped pass laws to create Reinsurance program to cover the most costly claims by people on Maryland Health Benefit Exchange and to have the Maryland Insurance Coverage Protection Commission study the long term stability of the state's insurance market.  I also helped passed laws to increase rescription drug price transparency and Telehealth, which will save lives, increase early diagnosis, produce better outcomes, and provide service to underserved communities.","The Governor and General Assembly must continue to work to pass laws with the collaborative input and participation of community, civil rights, law enforcement, prosecutors, public defenders, other stakeholders on gun violence, witness protection, prosecution, sentencing, expungement, restorative justice, increased support for crime prevention programs and other measures to address violent crime.","I have supported and helped pass laws such as the Maryland Healthy Families Act (earned sick leave), Equal Pay for Equal Work Act (which I was the lead senate sponsor), and increased child care subsidy funding, and other laws, which have allowed hard working individuals to take care of themselves or family members when they are sick or not make others in workplace sick, allowed domestic violence victims to take care of their legal work, and have a workplace that promotes transparency, fairness, merit and productivity.  The state can continue to pass similar laws which will help hard working families support themselves and enable businesses to recruit and keep the best and most talented workforce, all which will help boost our economy.","I support a comprehensive federal measure, instead of piece meal measures by the state, that will ensure an independent commission of multi-partisan, unaffiliated voters, diverse stakeholders with public input and a process and standards that support fairness and effective representation.","The law was intended to be a balance that would make changes in police training, standards, effectiveness, and accountability, while protecting  citizens' complaint processes, rights, and participation, as well as keeping communities safe.  As our laws continue to be a work in progress, there is always ways in which are our laws can be improved.","In addition to the legislation already passed by the General Assembly, there must be comprehensive collaboration by federal, state, and local government, health care providers and systems, law enforcement, prosecutors, victims, families, and other stakeholders on legislation, funding, policies, and programs to support education, awareness, intervention, addiction and overdose programs, new technologies and medical treatments for prevention and treatment, prescription drug guidelines and  best practices, and other measures to effectively address the opioid addiction and overdose crisis.","The Maryland General Assembly has and can continue to work to pass legislation to strengthen laws to fight race, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender, religion, age, and disability discrimination and discrimination against people of all backgrounds.  This session, the legislature passed laws to fight and address sexual harassment, which creates a hostile work environment and barriers to an employee's ability to succeed and achieve their fullest potential.  I was also the Senate Lead Sponsor of the Maryland Equal Pay for Equal Work Act, which updated and strengthened the state's pay equity law by prohibiting discrimination based on sex or gender identity, allowing an employee to ask or inquire about wage disparities without fear of retaliation or being fired, banning Mommy Tracking and employers from using affirmative defenses that are based not on merit, but on sex, gender identity, prior discriminatory practices, or outdated stereotypes, and creating a workplace that promotes transparency, fairness, merit and productivity.   The law is now one of the strongest pay equity laws in the nation.  I was also the Senate Lead sponsor of legislation to correct a loophole in the law that prevented individuals with certain serious disabilities from receiving vital nursing services (that enabled them to work) and continuing to work to support themselves.  I will continue to work on legislation to address income inequality.","While updates in our Public Information Act and open meetings laws were good steps in increasing accessibility, transparency and accountability, new issues addressing privacy rights, surveillance video, new technologies, government accountability, and other emerging issues also should be addressed.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education? Are you committed to funding associated reforms, and if so, how?","Is Maryland’s transportation spending appropriately balanced between roads and transit?

Current small business owner - Chesapeake Realty Investors, Inc.","I agree with some of the findings.  Among these are the need for better trained teachers and holding teachers more accountable.  We must remember that merely throwing money at a problem does not solve it.  Maryland spending on education is among the top in the nation.  Funding needs to be tied to results and school administration must be held accountable for the large amounts of money currently under their control.  Too often money is wasted and/or unaccounted for. A school is not a replacement for a home-life and a family where education starts. It used to be that a child came to school to learn. Now schools are expected to feed them, teach them right from wrong, and take the place of parenting, while at the same time tying teachers hands when discipline is needed.","When we try to force people out of their cars and into a public transportation system we end up with a system that is way over budget and grossly underutilized, like the Baltimore subway.  We don't have the resources to force people to use something that is simply inconvenient. Governor Hogan has said that he will address traffic issues on I95, I295 and other major highways surrounding Baltimore.  However, for this to be effective, the Baltimore Beltway especially needs to be addressed as it carries traffic between those roads.  Anyone traveling during rush hour understands this. Gasoline taxes and tolls already bring in enough funding to pay for these improvements.",Yes.  People in a free society should be able to make their own decisions as long as they are not hurting anyone else.  At one time gambling was against the law because we thought it was bad for people and now it brings millions of dollars into the states treasury.  Legalizing marijuana would decrease drug dealers as well as our prison population.,"The Chesapeake is a treasure and must be protected.  We do, however, have enough regulations and laws that have lead to significant improvements over the last 30+ years.  We are reaching a point where the regulations hinder employment and business growth and a more balanced approach must taken in the future.","We should eliminate Obama care once and for all.  Allow insurance companies to operate across state lines and create competition between insurers – that will give Marylander's the best rates possible, rather than creating an artificial environment.",The best thing the state can do is ensure that judges are appointed who believe in incarcerating violent criminals for a long time.  Unfortunately the Baltimore City delegation to Annapolis is much more concerned with the rights of the criminals because they continuously fight against toughening laws for hardened criminals. I believe Baltimore City residents deserve the same protection as people living in the rest of the state and the only was to ensure this is to deal with violent repeat offenders in the harshest way possible.  Baltimore City also needs to play its part – too often Baltimore City juries refuse to convict violent criminals at trial.  If Baltimore City juries don't take crime in the city seriously why should the burden fall on the rest of the state?,"The business climate is fair – we are still too highly regulated.  We give big businesses tax breaks to lure them here, while mom and pop businesses are over-regulated and overtaxed.  Don't overlook the businesses that are already here - we should offer them the same incentives that we are using to lure businesses, like Amazon,  from other states.",Maryland is one of the worst gerrymandered states in the country where the politicians pick the voters instead of the other way around.  Redistricting should be done with an eye on keeping communities together and lines should be drawn by impartial panels and not by politicians concerned about being re-elected.,"No, under this bill officers are only judged by other officers.  And it prevents the formation of civilian review boards that give civilians oversight over police.  The result is other officers judging each other rather than seeking input from an impartial third party.  In addition, the police board cannot acknowledge that an officer is under investigation.  If the charges are dropped the department may not publically acknowledge that that investigation ever took place or reveal the nature of the complaint.",80% of heroin addicts begin with an addiction to over prescribed pain medications.  The opioid issue is massive and is growing increasingly more complex and dangerous.  I would participate in counsels to address solutions giving those addicted the help they need and provide education for alternative pain relief options.,It is not the responsibility of the government to ensure income equality.  We are not a socialist state.  This has been tried in Cuba and Russia with bad results.,"In theory it works well.  However, in reality, we are still subject to the various layers of bureaucracy.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

Prior to going to law school, I worked as an administrator at Towson University where I developed and managed educational and leadership programs for undergraduate student organizations.","I am generally supportive of the Commission's findings and that is why I voted for House Bill 1415 this year, legislation that aligns with and advances the goals of the Commission. Prior to this, I supported House Bill 999 (2016), which established the Commission.  I am passionate about reducing achievement gaps based on income and race as I firmly believe that a child's zipcode and race should not determine whether they have access to a world-class education. In addition to improving outcomes, I am committed to funding the development of innovative computer science and IT curricula to meet the needs of a rapidly-changing economy. Automation threatens to eliminate many good-paying jobs both in the public and private sector, and we need to ensure that Maryland is well positioned to meet the demands of tomorrow's workforce. We also need to expand career opportunities for educators to attract and retain the best and brightest teachers, and we must improve the quality of standardized testing in our primary and secondary schools.","I believe that the Hogan administration has appropriately balanced roads and transit spending. With respect to our new transit system, BaltimoreLink, I believe that there have been marked improvements in both rider reliability and access to high-frequency transit. BaltimoreLink has also expanded access to job centers throughout the metro area. As an elected official, I have been impressed by the Department of Transportation's level of engagement with citizens, community groups, and legislators, and I am glad that department officials are committed to soliciting and  relying upon stakeholder feedback when making decisions about local transportation projects.","Given the challenges associated with the rollout of the medical marijuana industry in Maryland, I'm not convinced that the question of legalization for recreational use is even ripe at this point in time. Intellectually, it's a conversation we can certainly have (e.g., debating the functional difference between alcohol consumption and recreational use of cannabis when it comes to health and public safety outcomes), but, for now, let's keep the focus on helping our citizens gain access to medical treatment. That has been my focus as a member of the House Health and Government Operations Committee over the last four years.","Maryland should continue to prioritize Bay restoration efforts through the state budget, while our federal delegation should continue advocating for federal funding. We must also call upon our neighboring states to serve as partners in restoration efforts and sustainability.","There are an estimated 174,000 uninsured people in Maryland who are working but make too much money for ACA subsidies. For these Marylanders, insurance is anything but affordable. A family of four in the individual market with the current Gold Plan pays over $22,000 in premiums each year. The same family might expect to pay over $15,000 under a Bronze Plan. Assessing a higher deductible while providing the ten essential health benefits as defined by the ACA is one solution that could lower premiums by as much as 25% for Bronze Plan families, and as much as 84% for Gold Plan families. This alternative plan would be exempted from requiring additional state-mandated benefits, but these are benefits most people never use (but get stuck footing the bill for). This option will keep uninsured people out of the emergency room, which will help prevent higher costs to the broader health care system.  Maryland should also be looking to other states that have been successful in reducing premiums for innovative policy solutions.","It is critical that Baltimore  be able to compete with other major American cities for economic development opportunities and investment. Growth is vital if we are to create new jobs and stability for families in and around the city. But what company or prospective employer would want to call Baltimore home if its streets are unsafe, or if its homicide rate remains among the highest in the country?  The state must focus on making Baltimore an attractive play to live, work, and raise a family if we're going to remain competitive. I, therefore, believe that it is prudent for the General Assembly to play a role in helping the city address violent crime as it did in the closing days of the 2018 session when we passed bipartisan legislation that focused on cracking down on violent offenders, including volume drug dealers, through the imposition of harsher sentences. To be sure, our efforts represented a good start, but there is much work to be done in this area.","Maryland has benefited from a remarkable economic turnaround under the leadership of Governor Hogan. Since he took office, Maryland has gained over 110,000 jobs and holds the #1 ranking for job growth in the Mid-Atlantic region. In addition, our state's unemployment rate has dropped by 25 percent under Hogan. And according to a recent CNBC report, Maryland ranked seventh nationwide in economic performance.   So, candidly, if we want to continue to create family-supporting jobs and grow our economy, the answer is simple: re-elect Larry Hogan. His economic policies are working!","Yes! In fact, this is the issue that ""got me off the couch"" five years ago when I first decided to run for a seat in the state legislature. The idea that politicians in Annapolis manipulate electoral outcomes for partisan or political gain is maddening.  In my first session as a member of the House, I introduced legislation, House Bill 906 (2015), to create an independent body to draw legislative and congressional district maps using fair, impartial, and objective standards; standards that would allow voters to choose their elected representatives, not the other way around.  I have also authored legislation, the Maryland Fair Representation Act,  House Bill 1328 (2018), which would guarantee that all Marylanders enjoy an equal voice and equal representation in the House of Delegates. Currently, about two-thirds of Marylanders have three delegates, while the remaining one-third  have only one or two representatives in the lower chamber. This is a clear violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause and an affront to our democratic process. But, more importantly, it's just plain wrong. It not only foments public distrust in state government, but undermines the very integrity of our elections.","Yes, the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights adequately balances protections for police and the public. Baltimore City certainly has challenges with respect to policing policy (that should be addressed by city leaders), but one jurisdiction's need for reform should not necessitate sweeping changes to the LEOBR, which works well across the State of Maryland.","In addition to all of the important steps we are already taking, I would place a greater emphasis on educating our young people on the dangers of experimentation, particularly because of how high addicting these substances are. Many do not perceive trying opioids as risky. According to a study done by the University of Michigan, ""[a]lthough Opioid Pain Relivers have an abuse liability similar to that of heroin, they are commonly perceived as less risky. Seventy-three percent of eighth graders surveyed in 2013 perceived occasional use of heroin without a needle as high risk, but only 26% perceived occasional use of Vicodin as high risk. Eighth graders also perceived occasional Vicodin use as less risky than occasional marijuana use, less risky than smoking 1–5 cigarettes per day, and less risky than moderate alcohol use."" This is alarming and tells me that we need to raise awareness about just how dangerous opioids, fentanyl, and carfentanil really are through educational programs and initiatives.","We should focus on creating apprenticeship programs  for high school graduates in underrepresented communities, as well as foster the development of more public-private partnerships  in emerging industries, such as IT. The state can offer tax incentives to employers in these industries who will provide on-the-job training for socioeconomically disadvantaged candidates, as well as opportunities for gainful employment after the completion of such training.","Maryland's PIA laws generally work well, but I have two major concerns: 1) At times, jurisdictions will use ""prohibitive cost"" reasoning to prevent information from being gathered and transmitted. This needs to be addressed, particularly if a requestor individual can suggest a more cost-effective way to access requested information;and 2) The General Assembly continues to move legislation in (literal) backrooms in the State House and government office buildings, with little or no notice, no opportunity for public comment, and, in some cases, no access for the press. This is completely unacceptable. A vote that's announced mere minutes before it is taken violates the spirit of our open meetings laws.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

This can be done through a commission that has the power to impose restrictions and provide the resource to provide the care for the addition.",If we provide less regulations and less taxes on small businesses - they will grow and they will hire employees and provide more jobs.

I have also served in elected positions since 2014. More importantly, I have a working relationship with the current Maryland State Senator, C. Anthony Muse, and have actively engaged with him regarding legislation impacting the 26th District and Maryland. As a result, he has endorsed me for the Maryland State Senate seat, which he will be vacating. Finally, I was accepted in the 2018 Emerge Maryland class, which will further prepare me as a woman running for a Democratic office.","Yes. I believe that funding for associated reforms should include leveraging money from developers who come to the county, and should be put into a lock- box.  All funding should be in addition to the established budget for education, increasing pre-K and expanding K-12 innovative learning opportunities. Finally, money should be specified to increase teacher salary and retention, and appropriate school construction projects.","No, Maryland's transportation spending is not appropriately balanced between roads and transit.  Yes, the state has the resources to meet its transportation needs.   Baltimore Link could benefit from more transient -oriented construction. This will afford residents the opportunity to be able to increase employment options, social options, and live in the vicinity of public transportation.","No. As far as I understand, recreational marijuana can have a negative impact on brain cells and functioning.",I will support initiatives that continue Bay restoration programing that began in 1983 that resulted in underwater grass abundance to female crab population growth and water clarity.,I believe that Maryland should enter into a thorough research inquiry into a single-payer health care system. This system will provide healthcare services for all.,Baltimore could address the underlying trauma that tends to result in an increase in violent crime. This trauma could be addressed through an increase in mental health services that begin as early as elementary school and continue through high school. Access to increased mental health services will undoubtedly help to reduce violent crimes and so forth.,"Maryland's business climate is promising. There are numerous opportunities available that can help to increase the success of small businesses.  Additionally, through the increase of collegiate, vocational, apprenticeship, and internship programs, the business climate will undoubtedly improve.","Yes, I support the creation of a non-partisan, independent body to draw legislative and congressional district maps after each census.","No. I believe the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights would be improved with the inclusion of more citizens on review boards, with voting power,  and investigations involving brutality.",I believe there must be increased education on opioid and the impact it has on residence.

Bush's Administration, Deputy Chief of Staff for Maryland Governor Bob Ehrlich's Executive Office, and now serving as State Delegate in the Maryland General Assembly.  Areas of focus include homeland security, public safety, social and faith-based services, and budget and appropriations.","As a member of the House Appropriations Committee and as an active member in local education meetings,  I have been attending the Kirwan Commission meetings focusing on career-trade-technology education which is one of the priorities of the Commission.  I supported the extension of the Kirwan Commission and $200 million in the FY '19  budget.  I   support the focus of the Kirwan Commission including Pre-kindergarten expansion, teacher recruitment, and career-technology education.  I also support the lockbox to ensure that casino proceeds go to education as originally promised.  I am particularly concerned with putting money into the classroom in order to directly benefit the teaching professionals and students. When the Maryland Lottery was first proposed it was determined that any funds would be dedicated to education. I would propose returning to that formula.","Currently road funding is woefully behind. As a representative of a district that is predominantly rural, I will continue to work  to return our Highway User funds to their rightful source to the counties and municipalities. I have been working along with Governor Hogan to restore Highway User Funds and believe that each year we have taken great strides for providing for the transportation needs of all Marylanders.  This year, I joined with my colleagues to pass legislation that provides certainty and predictability beginning in FY 2020 through FY  2024  by guaranteeing at least an additional $30 million in municipal HUR funding and an additional $32 million in county HUR  funding.  It is my belief that before we undertake a massive project such as the Red Line that we must first repair our aging infrastructure and provide funding to finally complete construction and expansion of the Baltimore Beltway.",No. In the midst  of a Heroin/Opioid epidemic marijuana can serve as a gateway drug to more potent forms of drugs. I have arrived at this decision after consulting with law enforcement and health officials and local families.,We should build on the success of local programs and partnerships including the work of non profits like the Maryland Coastal Bays Program.  In additionthe State should continue to adequately fund the Chesapeake and Atlantic Coastal Bays 2010 Trust Fund as was done in the FY 19 Budget at $52.9 million.,"The Maryland General Assembly and Governor Hogan worked to protect Marylanders from a dramatic 50% increase in their health insurance rates. House Bill 1795- Maryland Health Benefit Exchange - Establishment of a reinsurance Program creates the structure for a reinsurance program to be administered by the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange (MHBE), which is predicted to help stabilize rates for the next several years. I voted for this bill and the Governor has signed it into law.","All State law enforcement agencies should continue to serve in a supporting role to Baltimore law enforcement. I also believe HB 291/SB 1131 - Criminal Law - Prohibitions, Prosecutions and Corrections, which makes it easier to prosecute high volume drug dealers, will be a useful deterrent to violent crime. Also, legislation that increases the penalties for witness intimidation from 5 to 10 years will help address the violence in Baltimore. Both of these bills passed this Session.","In my District it is absolutely essential that we have a business climate competitive with Delaware and Virginia. I have consistantly supported policies and voted for initiatives that improve Maryland's business economy including regulatory relief, tax relief and a proactive partnership with our local jurisdictions to retain and attract businesses to Maryland. I have been working with area employers and local school systems to establish Career Trades Technology Education to develop a skilled workforce and to ensure that our students have the necessary skills to meet the requirements of our employers. I have a 100% rating from the Maryland Business for Responsive Government and have received the Maryland Retailers Association Award.",Yes.,"For the most part, I believe the current Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights adequately balances the protections for police and the public. Since I am aware that there are some flaws, I would be willing to consider some changes to improve the current policy after consultation with stakeholders affected by the policy.","As a member of the House Health Appropriations Committee and a member of the Worcester Opioid Intervention team, I have been working with Governor Hogan's Administration, my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and local stakeholder on a comprehensive strategy to strengthen education, prevention, treatment and recovery infrastructure, and law enforcement. I also believe that those who helped create this mess should ultimately pay for its clean up.","Addresssing income inequality starts with education. We empower all families by continuing to support historic levels of funding for Pre-Kindergarten - 12 and support the priorities of the Kirwan Commission which includes Pre-K expansion, teacher recruitment and Career Trade Technology Education. Geographical disparity in education has to be addressed to ensure an  even playing field so that students - regardless of where they live - are equally and adequately prepared to succeed in an ever increasingly competitive job market.",No. I favor ever increasing transparency  and will strive to see that all meetings of the General Assembley and it various committees and subcommittees be televised and available on the web.,"Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

Baltimore City Council 1982-1987
Maryland State Senate 1994-Present","Absolutely, I am a very strong supporter of education. We set aside in this years' budget $200,000,000 as a deposit on future funding needs for the implementation of Kirwan. We also passed the ""lock box"" legislation that will be on the ballot in the General Election that mandates all casino money to be used to increase and not supplant school funding.","There is an imbalance in Maryland under this administration where the appropriations are slanted significantly  towards roads. Baltimore Link is just what it says-link- not a   comprehensive, integrated mass transit system that the Baltimore region deserves.","Maybe in the future, but not at this time. We have to see how the medical cannibus initiative works.","Maryland, Virginia and Pennsylvania take the restoration of the Chesapeake Bay more seriously than the Trump administration. I stongly support the work of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, and will support all of  efforts and initiatives to clean up thhis important natural resource.  ","We need to recognize that the Republicans on Capitol Hill will do everything they can to decimate Obamacare, but we must ensure we have the tools make the ACA succeessful.  In Maryland, we are looking at an innovative solution which will create an individual mandate. It will work to keep our funds in an escrow-like setting that will give individuals and families the  opportunity to use those funds to purchase health insurance. This will expand the pool and lower rates for all. ",We need a comprehensive approach to Baltimore's crime problem that emphasizes  community policing and additional resources that result in more officers on foot patrol as opposed to desk and office duties. An enhanced use of tehnology can help in all areas. I also stongly support the multipronged approach we moved forward in the General Assembly to increase  penalties for repeat violent gun offenders while significantly increasing our Safe Streets program. We akso gave additional tools to the Baltimore City Police and The States Attorney's Office to assit in their effort to fighting crime.,"Maryland's business climate is underated, it works better for those with means but presents problems for many others. We need to do more to expand opporrunities for those without college degrees and expand tehnology related educational opportunities. We need to foster better alignment of the business needs of our citizens by expanding the skill sets of our residents through certified job training and apprentice prgrams. Further expansion of the Governors' P-Tech program  will provide additional opportunities for our high school students. Additionally, we need to make college education more afforable by passing legislation such as the degree without a debt bill that we passed in the General Assembly this year.",I think redistricting is a national problem that needs a national  and/or regional solution.  I hope the Supreme Court will lay out standards this summer to address this national problem.,In Maryland and many other states we are in many respects hampered by the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights (LEOBoR). This legislation has made it almost impossible to discipline and remove bad police officers. Under LEOBoR officers are judged  by other officers and it prevents civilian  input in the process. Recent events in Baltimore City clearly show we can and must do better. We must learn from our mistakes and make appropiate changes that clearly address the few bad actors in the Baltimore City Police Department. We need full participation of citizens on police trial boards. I also supported the creation of the state commission which will investigate allegations of police corruption that was revealed as a result of the Gun Trace Task Force investigation with supbeoena power.,"We need more options for treatment. We also need to be smarter on crime - by going after the high level drug kingpins, while ensuring that those who are low level drug users get diverted into programs that can help them. ","We need to address this critical issue - that's why I introduced legislation to raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour, but unfortunately it failed, It is also  why I supported paid sick leave, and voted to override the Governors veto. I am a very strong supporter of collective bargainng which enhance the opportunities for our hard working ctizens to raise their familites.We must also eliminate the disparities of income between men and women that was revealed in a recent study that showed women earning $.84 to every $100 earned by a man.","We can do better, for example when the Governor convened his  Sick Leave Task Force  without strict adherence to our open meetings law, there were no public records and little or no opportunity to hear the concerns of business people or  thier employees. We must avoid this happening in the future. It is essential that we do better in the General Assembly by taking additional steps to be more open and transparent. We should work to have our floor sesions live streamed to the public as are our comittee sessions.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

Managing partner in Glen Oak Professional Bank Director Hospital Board Member Board member on many non-profit boards,"Yes, I do support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education.  This is confirmed by my vote this year for HB1415.  I am looking forward to the Kirwin Commission completing their work.  I will continue to support education funding and my record reflects that support.",Maryland's transportation spending is not appropriately balanced between roads and transit.  Maryland cannot continue to build roads that encourages more congestion. We need to be looking to the future for ways to mitigate the congestion. I have chaired the subcommittee for Motor Vehicle and Transportation Policy for the past four years.  Educating voters on the need for mass transit is not an easy task.  Annapolis is one of only 8 capitals in the country that does not have mass transit available to the capital.  I sponsored HB1468 to assist employers and employees with job access.  In my opinion Baltimore Link has not done enough to improve transportation in the Baltimore region.,I am not a fan of legalizing recreational marijuana. I have observed the increase in vehicle accidents in the states that have allowed recreational marijuana and the combination of  using  marijuana along with distracted driving is not a good combination.,"As a member of the Environment and Transportation Committee for the past twelve years, I have seen Maryland make many changes that are helping to improve the Bay and we are seeing significant improvement. We have implemented cover crops, limited development in critical areas, limited new septic systems and required BAT systems, increased the oyster population and improved our major and minor waste water plants.  The pollution from the Conowingo  Dam continues to be our problem and the Federal Government must help us with that issue.",Maryland took major steps this year to help our citizens with affordable health care. The ACA Workgroup is working to lower premiums in the individual market by seeking a federal waiver for flexibility to use federal funds to help create a state-run reinsurance program and curb the premium increase from having substantial effects on the rest of the insurance market. HB 1782  will authorize the State to collect the 2.75% ($380 million) in suspended federal fees from insurance companies to pay for a state reinsurance pool. It also requires a study to explore further long-term solutions for the insurance industry  and stabilize individual market rates.  I will continue to support ways to find affordable health care for everyone.,"Baltimore is an important contributor to  Maryland's economy.  We need to help increase the police protection in communities.  We passed bills this year for sentencing mandates for repeat offenders and firearm safety bills.  More needs to be done and Baltimore City's leadership in this role is important.  We are ""one Maryland"" and assisting Baltimore with their crime issue helps all of Maryland.","Maryland's business climate is good, but could be better.  Our employment rate is one of the lowest in the country.  As a State we need to better prepare our workforce, which is being addressed by the Kirwin Commission, we also need to provide more dependable transportation. The Augustine Commission recommended reducing corporate tax and I will support that reduction.","Yes, I do support the creation of a non-partisan, independent body to create the legislative and congressional district maps after the next census. The gerrymandering, by both parties, has to stop.","As citizens, have a right to decide how our police departments are run, how our officers are trained, and how they are held accountable.  As times change, our laws are re-evaluated to ensure that they continue to operate as intended.   I was proud to support the 2016 police reform legislation submitted by the Workgroup on Public Safety and Policing.  Considered landmark police reform legislation, this new law codified the requirement that all police disciplinary hearings be open to the public, allows a police chief to appoint a civilian member to hearing boards, and, if authorized by local law, include up to two voting or nonvoting members of the public to serve on the hearing boards.  The law makes it easier for police officers to disclose information that evidences gross mismanagement, dangers to the public, or even violations of law committed by other law enforcement officers.  The new law also made sweeping changes to the Maryland Police Training and Standards Commission and many of the benefits from these changes are just now being realized.","The legislature is working to address the opioid crises. Both prevention and treatment are strategies that we need to embrace. Anne Arundel County is a  model for the country with our ""Safe Stations"" and the ""Not my Child"" prevention program.  The over dose epidemic seems to increase even with all the programs and help we are providing.  As a State, we need to continue to work on prevention and enforcement and tough sentencing for drug dealers.  HB1092 includes mobile crises teams, crises residential beds and crises response teams.  Funding will be provided by annual grants beginning in 2020.  More needs to be done to follow suspicious prescriptions and educating doctors  about over prescribing.  Opioid addiction often begins with an injury that requires pain medication.","The State can address income equality by doing a better job of  preparing our workforce for the jobs that are available, provide more dependable transportation, and increase the minimum wage for our full time workers.  Maryland has a very high cost of living compared to many of our surrounding states.","In my opinion the Public Information Act and open meetings laws do adequately ensure Marylanders' the ability to exercise oversight in government.  All of our legislative meetings are open and recorded.  If a citizen misses a meeting or cannot attend a meeting, they can go back and watch our proceedings.  In Anne Arundel County the same is true of our County Council meetings, our Board of Education meetings and our School Board Nominating Commission meetings.  I feel that sometimes citizens do not know where to find the information and my office does help direct our citizens with that information.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

If we don't educate our children, we won't have to worry about the future because there won't be one. We must insure that every dollar going into education trust fund is used in our schools.  Whatever it takes, we should support the findings.","The General Assembly passed a bill to insure there was equity in providing funding for our roads, bridges, and transit.  The cancellation of the Red Line serves as a disadvantage for the Baltimore region.  I do believe our transportation system has the resources to respond to this critical need.",I do not support the legalization of marijuana for recreational purposes.,"We need strong communication and an educational component for our citizens regarding what happens when they litter our roads and highways.  Land run offs are a contributing factor to the pollution of the Chesapeake Bay.  We need stronger legislation for companies and those who do not control poultry litter, dumping of refuse, and poor waste water management. We also need to better control the use of materials used in fertilizer which are a part of the water that flows into the Chesapeake and kill our fish.",I am a strong unwavering supporter of the Universal Care Act.  Everyone should be able to have access to quality health care.  We need to expand the Medical Assistance Program for families and make Medicaid more available for low income and disabled citizens.,"The General Assembly must provide every resource possible to help Baltimore which at one time was the economic engine for the state.  This includes, job creation, education enhancement, providing incentives for economic development, improved health care and affordable housing.","More time needs to be spent talking about what's great about our state.  Our public relations need a ""shot in the arm"" on this issue.  We need also to provide more incentive packages for companies to relocate here.","Yes, I do support this important body.",I think there needs to be an independent panel established to look at this Bill of Rights and make recommended changes.,"We need to train more people to work in our schools, churches, communities regarding the devastation of any drug.

The primary focus should be mass transit, not only WMATA and the Purple Line, as well as the advent of Montgomery County BRT, but the Baltimore region, as a major metropolitan area, should have a first class mass transit system as well. The state does have the resources, if it wants to find them, and we can raise gas taxes again as necessary.",Yes. The tax revenues should be used to shore up the health care system and public education.,"We seem to be improving our regional political climate, as evidenced by the recent agreement to provide a guaranteed funding stream for WMATA, so we can extend that to the Bay as we have in the past. We need to maintain and improve our stormwater and septic tank efforts. Dealing with chicken farm manure disposal is still a major problem.  While the trump regime is not supportive, our regional Congressional and Senate delegation is stepping  up as best they can.","We should work to come as close as we can to a functional single payer system, while advocating for the United States to join the league of industrial and post-industrial nations which all use some form of a single payer system.","Reform the bail bond system. Reform the Law Enforcement Officers' Bill of Rights and bring civilian review back into the oversight system. Work closely with the police to educate them on dealing with various minority communities, including those with mental disabilities. Empower the residents who live in the communities most exposed to violence to develop structures -- community schools, after-school program, job training -- to offer their residents an alternative path. Legalize marijuana and develop harm reduction models for substance abusers to mitigate the damage caused by the drug war.","It's better than the Republican party would have us believe.  We need to add more vo-tech and coding programs in high school. We should develop incubators on the model of the Y-Combinator in California to encourage the risk-taking necessary to create new, innovative programs. We should encourage tax credits for entrepreneurs, including relief from capital gains taxes similar to the federal JOBS Act. The Amazon HQ2 package includes reasonable incentives, as far as I can tell.",Yes.,"No, it does not. There should not be a special layer of due process -- cooling off periods, adequate breaks not offered to other defendants, investigation by other police, informing officers of the complainants and their testimony before questioning, the use of a hearing board before a final decision is made, maintenance of salary and benefits during suspensions, purging of complaints and investigative reports after three years. If there is no effort to implement these changes, then we should consider adding these special layers of due process for everyone instead.","Support a harm reduction model - this includes the following:  Make naloxone available in all health-care facilities and EMT/paramedic teams. Create safe injection sites with adequate medical supervision. Allow drug checking for individuals to anonymously submit drug samples (critical given all the tainted drugs being injected by users ignorant of the makeup of the drugs being injected. Offer Medication Treatment, whereby heroin is replaced by a longer-acting but less euphoric opioid. Work to educate the public about opioid overdose, and encourage health-care facilities to participate so that the public develops increased trust in the system.","Ensure that corporations pay their taxes -- close the combined reporting loophole. Rebuild the state's estate tax, which should not be on a glide path to repeal. De-linking from the federal scale and limiting the ceiling to $5 million is insufficient. Re-create a more progressive income tax, such as recreating a higher bracket, formerly known as the millionaire's bracket. Bring the Fight for a $15 Minimum Wage to a successful outcome.","No, they don't. I worked with then-Delegate Heather Mizeur in 2009 to improve transparency and accountability. The effort resulted in recording/live-streaming of chamber hearings and votes, putting committee votes online, and trying to get all delegation meetings and votes live-streamed. There is also a need to reform the system for committee testimony, which greatly inconveniences the residents of our state who  come to Annapolis to lobby but often have to spend an entire day waiting for their three minutes.

The reforms outlined in the Commission Report is needed to make Maryland an international leader in high-quality public education.","From years of underfunding and/or neglect the needs of our infrastructure needs to be addressed immediately.  Improvement to aging roads and bridges is paramount and our outdated mass transit is woefully inadequate for the needs of the citizens in Maryland, Pennsylvania and Virginia that commute everyday  into business regions throughout Maryland.  The state must  make a commitment to make transportation a priority.  The Baltimore region is inadequately served by public transportation. The gaps that still exist with the cancellation of the Red Line and the attempt of the Baltimore Link to update an antiquated mass transit system has missed it mark for those who live in the outlying areas.",Legalized marijuana for recreational use is now a reality that must be addressed! I would support the legalization of recreational marijuana only if the revenue from the taxes can be specifically 'locked' for education or transportation.,"The first step I would take to protect the Chesapeake Bay is to find more funding for the Chesapeake Bay Foundation which works at the local, state, and federal level to restore the waters through education, advocacy, litigation, and restoration programs.",The most significant health challenge facing Maryland  is the concern of the working middle- class and those just below the poverty line that cannot afford the premiums nor have the access to health-care.  To ensure the broadest possible access to affordable health care I would  consult and/or confer with both providers and consumers to exam situations and solutions for varying types of issues.,"Maryland needs Baltimore to be strong, but what policy makers are currently doing in Baltimore isn't working. For generations, we have continued to ignore the fundamental problem, those born in Baltimore seem to have fewer opportunities than those born elsewhere. Baltimore spends more than $17,000 annually per student on education and yet outcomes do not equal that level of investment. We need to help our kids by reforming our education system and expanding trade and technical skill training beginning when children are young.  Improving the quality of life of the city's residents will aid in the reduction of violent crimes.","Maryland's business climate is of skilled labor especially in cyber-security.  With that being said, small businesses are important to any economy because they employ many more local people than do large-scale corporations, and the money small businesses make stays local as well, small businesses provide family-supporting jobs.",Maryland's system of redistricting needs to be reformed. We need to implement a non-partisan panel to draw our state and federal districts. Maryland has some of the most gerrymandered districts in the nation. The current process deprives Marylanders of real choices and a fair political debate.,"The Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights is for the protection of police officers only, it does not make provisions for the protection of the public.","The opioid epidemic does not discriminate, impacting communities and families across the nation. There are several strategies that I would implement that can assist in the reduction of opioid addiction and overdose, they include utilization of management (limiting the supply to only 7 days), monitoring pharmacists before and after dispensing prescriptions and education.",We must invest in education and training for middle-class families so we can raise our standard of living.,"The public's right to information about government activities lies at the heart of a democratic government however, the Public Information Act (PIA) does not ensure oversight to the government  due to the limitations of protecting legitimate governmental interests and the privacy rights of individual citizens.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

I received my Ph.D. in the Biomedical Sciences, with a concentration in Biochemistry and Cancer Biology, from the MD Anderson Cancer Center – UT Health Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences. I completed my postdoctoral studies as a National Science Foundation – Defense Threat Reduction Agency fellow at the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases.","For the past twenty years, I have worked as a scientist in industry, academia and government. I spent a year working for a food microbiological testing company, developing tests to enable food companies to test their products for the presence of food-borne pathogens. During graduate school, as part of my training, I worked as a graduate research assistant, conducting independent research on everything from electron microscopy of viruses to lung cancer. For the past 10 years, I have been at the U.S. Army Institute of Infectious Diseases, working my way up from postdoctoral research fellow to Senior Research Scientist. My work at USAMRIID has focused on disease models and treatments for viruses like Ebola virus, which caused the devastating outbreak in West Africa in 2014. I have also worked a number of other jobs throughout my life, often more than one at a time, in order to make ends meet and pay for school. I have delivered newspapers, pizzas and phone books. I have worked in fast food restaurants and piano bars, doing everything from taking orders to making food. I have worked in offices and warehouses. I even worked in a bingo hall! I understand what a hard day's work is, and the importance of education in lifting people out of poverty.","I support the findings of the Commission, and I am committed to implementing them, and fully funding education in Maryland. It is important to remember that money spent on education is not simply spent and gone. We provide public education because it is the right thing to do, but it is also true that every dollar spent on education provides a return on investment. The state can start by using the casino revenues to supplement education funding. This was addressed by the General Assembly with the Fix the Fund constitutional amendment. I support this amendment, and will work to gain approval for this amendment by voters in November 2018. I would further propose legislation to end Gov. Hogan's BOOST program, and redirect that money to public education. Uncoupling Maryland's estate tax rules from the federal government could also provide revenues for funding public education.","Despite being 18 years into the 21st century, our transportation system and planning are stuck in the past. Maryland should shift its focus to developing modern, mass transit solutions for the entire state. This will require working with our neighboring states and the federal government, and will not happen overnight. We need to elect leaders who will prioritize modernizing our transit and transportation. Maintaining the status quo is not an option. With regards to Baltimore, BaltimoreLink is a step in the right direction.  However, Baltimore needs a modern, comprehensive transit system, such as has been proposed by Baltimore's Transit Choices.",Yes.,"The Chesapeake Bay is not only a natural treasure, but an economic driver for Maryland. I will focus on making sure Maryland meets milestones in the ""Clean Water Blueprint,"" including ensuring that we develop metrics to track new pollution arising from land development, and develop policies to offset such pollution. Programs that incentivize developers to include green infrastructure, such as impervious pavement and green roofs, can decrease the amount of stormwater carrying pollutants into the Bay and its tributaries. I also support requiring all newly installed septic systems to use best available technology (BAT).","I support single-payer health care, and taking steps to move Maryland in that direction. This will be a process, which will require careful thought and planning. Maryland, because of our current all-payer system, is ahead of the game. The cost-savings of a single payer system will be significant, but more information will need to be gathered to determine the best way to pay for setting up the system. However, beginning the process must be a priority for Maryland, and will be a priority of mine.","The state can and should fund programs such as Roca, UMAR Boxing, the Rose Street Community Center and Safe Streets as part of an effort to increased investments in after-school programs, mentorship programs and job training across the state. We must also ensure that we are fully funding our police departments and crime labs.","I appreciate the pairing of these two questions, as we often ask what we can do for business, but not what we can do for families. Families need a living wage, and we must pass an increased minimum wage in Maryland. Investing in career technology centers in schools, and developing comprehensive programs to funnel our young people to trades and community colleges, not simply four year colleges must be a component. Now is the time for Maryland to invest in green energy, and the jobs that will come along with that. Maryland's business climate will improve along with these investments, as well as investments in modern transit and affordable housing.",Yes.,"Several changes to the LEOBR would strengthen protections against police misconduct. Changes should include requiring all misconduct cases involving the public to go to a hearing board, and removing the barriers to fully implementing the reforms of 2016 that allowed for voting civilians on trial boards. Any allegation of police brutality should be investigated, regardless of when the incident occurred. Greater civilian involvement and transparency doesn't just benefit civilians, but improves trust and communication with law enforcement.","I support the use of comprehensive user engagement sites and medication-assisted therapy. A comprehensive approach that includes education and prevention, combined with the best harm-reduction practices available, will be key to solving the opioid crisis.","There are a number of steps we can take to address income inequality. First and foremost will be raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, and indexing it to inflation. I support legislation mandating blind recruitment practices in government hiring in order to increase diversity in hiring, as well as preventing employers from asking about salary history during the hiring process. A major focus of my tenure, should I be elected, will be developing a paid family leave program, removing one of the barriers to women remaining in the workplace after having children.","Some changes could be considered, such as fee waivers to all the indigent to access records about themselves.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

Carter,Carter,6/18/1963,Baltimore,Democratic,Baltimore City,http://www.JillPCarter.com,committeeforjillpcarter,jillpcarter,,"Juris Doctor,  University of Baltimore Bachelor of Arts,  Loyola university Western High School","Attorney, Director of Civil Rights, Legislator","Yes, Of course. The Kirwan Commission has released its initial recommendations to create a world class education system in Maryland through a new statewide funding formula.  The Commission endorses a funding formula that considers the needs of at risk students, which include low income students, students with language barriers, students with disabilities and students living in high concentration of poverty.  I am fully supportive of a funding structure that takes these factors into consideration.  Baltimore City Public Schools have been historically, unconstitutionally, underfunded. I will advocate legislation to implement the full recommendations of the Kirwan Commission which hopefully will reflect an adequate funding formula for the students across Maryland, and Baltimore City in particular.","Maryland is unique compared to other states because the state's investment in transit is almost as much as highways (approx; $8 Billion for transit, $10 Billion for highways).  However, the share of transit funds dedicated to the Baltimore Metropolitan Area, although it is the largest metro area in the state, has always been secondary and insufficient for the Baltimore region and Baltimore City in particular. The state has some of the oldest infrastructure in the nation.  Historic funding methods do not produce revenues needed to perform the massive reconstruction programs needed to upgrade bridges, roads, transit systems and more as well as to invest in new construction and technology. Baltimore's transit needs are not being adequately served.  Nearly, one-third of our residents are transit dependent and the travel time, from the most impacted areas to major job centers, can be up to 2 hours each way.  Baltimore Link has begun to upgrade the network and technology but there is more that needs to be done to properly serve the transit dependent population as well as making transit a viable first choice for all travelers.  Transit in the city is not interconnected and it only serves specific areas or pockets.  The state has funded a transit study and this study needs to be integrated with a comprehensive transportation plan for the city to ensure a complete transportation system that provides for connectivity and access from all modes to all people. The metro should be expanded in all directions.",Yes.,"Legislators should continue to advocate for strong environmental protection legislation, utilize the best technology to deal with storm water runoff, especially in Baltimore with so much impervious surface, and invest in educating youth regarding the health of the Chesapeake Bay, our role in it, and its impact on our lives.  For more than 4 decades, the Inner Harbor has been Baltimore's thriving center of entertainment and tourism. It needs upgrades, however, to remain a draw for local residents and millions who visit Baltimore. There is a goal of making the harbor safe for swimming and fishing by the end of the decade. The state should partner with the Baltimore City Department Public Works to provide funding to upgrade our aged sewage system.","The Maryland General Assembly passed bipartisan legislation (HB 1795/SB 1267) intended to stabilize health care insurance rates for the next several years. I support a single payer, healthcare for all, system. Slowly, but surely, I believe we will get there.","Legislative leaders should allow the passage of legislation to end and prevent lead poisoning of children;  adequately fund the schools; provide funding for community based up-lift, conflict resolution, and anti-violence programs, such as: expansion of the Safe Streets initiative, Operation Ceasefire, expungement eligibility and access, expand Ban-the-Box to make it actually work, and increase resources and authority for civilian governance and oversight of police, and expand pre-trial services and diversion programs.  The solutions to violence reduction require a cultural shift that can be achieved through policies intended to uplift and repair damage of decades' long discrimination and disinvestment","Baltimore has world class institutions of higher learning, innovative healthcare companies, and the thriving Port of Baltimore.  There are great opportunities in Baltimore, but structural barriers and historic inequities make it difficult for many of our residents to obtain economic opportunities. We must encourage and incentivize employers to increase their investments in local neighborhoods and continue to support the RISE Zone program. We must  also ensure our educational institutions adequately train and prepare our residents for the 21st century workplace.",Absolutely.  It is essential democracy to ensure a fair and impartial process in determining congressional and legislative district boundaries.,"The only effective way to improve police misconduct and the culture of corruption within the Baltimore Police Department is to legislate expanded authority for adequately resourced civilian oversight.  The ability to independently investigate incidents of police misconduct is essential to ensure accountability and restore the public's trust and confidence in the Baltimore Police Department. The legislature just established a temporary commission to investigate BPD Gun Trace Task Force.  The better approach would be to authorize the Civilian Review Board, a permanent agency, to have unlimited investigatory and governance power.  I was the legislative leader on law enforcement reform and changes to the LEOBR.  If not repealed altogether, it should be amended to carve out exemptions for civilian oversight agency to have broadened authority","Legislation that would make a difference in the opioid crisis includes funding of evidence based treatment on demand through 24/7 crisis centers, and supporting efforts to protect and strengthen the Affordable Care Act. I support the availability of naloxone and continuing funding for diversion programs such as LEAD (Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion) and require treatment in our jails.  The city, in partnership with the state, will be opening its first ever Stabilization Center.  The center will provide 24/7 specialized, on demand treatment for individuals with substance abuse disorders and mental health concerns.  All community health matters must include ending lead poisoning","We must ensure a state wide approach to pass legislation to raise the minimum wage to $15.00 per hour to improve life for all of our residents. We must assist and uplift those that struggle to survive and struggle to provide for their families and pay for housing and living expenses. Maryland is one of the wealthiest states in the country with one of the highest costs of living. Increasing the minimum wage, working to ensure a living wage, and legislating and enforcing anti-discrimination laws and policies to ensure gender and racial pay equity is essential to support working families and improve our economy.","No, I sponsored legislation to create a Public Information Act Compliance Act Compliance Board.   Maryland's transparency rating has been among the lowest in the country.  All persons should be entitled to have access to information about the affairs of government and the official acts of elected officials.  There is room for improvement in the area of government transparency and oversight.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

I also supported the 2016 legislation creating the Commission and played a key role in passing the Commission's initial recommendations as Chair of the Senate Education, Health, and Environmental Affairs Committee.  The Kirwan Commission is taking a comprehensive look at the funding adequacy of our public schools, improvement must be made to keep up with a changing economy and the evolving jurisdictional needs of individual school systems.  I am committed to funding the reforms recommended by the Commission to ensure Maryland's public schools are a world class system.  It is vital that the Commission have sufficient time to fully vet Maryland's unique educational issues and develop a comprehensive report to determine how to best create a sustainable funding mechanism for our public schools, while requiring accountability for local jurisdictions is in place to ensure those dollars benefit students directly.    Maryland must have a substantial/sustainable revenue source to adequately fund and maintain a successful K-12 educational system.  As the sponsor of SB1122, establishing a Constitutional Amendment placing a ""lockbox"" on Maryland's casino gaming revenues for our public school system to fund education exclusively.  Casino revenues can no longer be used to offset funding for other state projects.  As Chair of the education policy committee in the Maryland Senate, I will use my leadership position to ensure these dollars are leveraged.","No, Maryland's transportation funding is not appropriately balanced between roads and transit.   Governor Hogan's decision to cancel the Red Line has had a devastating impact to the larger communities of the Baltimore Region.  The decision hinders working class citizens' access to economic mobility by denying affordable, reliable and efficient transit options.  Without an affordable and efficient means of travel, many of Baltimore's citizens are trapped in the economic deserts of their impoverished neighborhoods.   Maryland has to do better and, in fact, had plans to do better until the Hogan Administration decided to cut the Red Line.  I will continue to fight alongside Baltimore leaders to bring transportation options to our City and Region.  The State has the resources to meet its transportation needs, however Governor Hogan's decision to repeatedly spend that funding on projects that serve to solidify electoral votes in rural areas, rather than support sound transportation policy has harmed Maryland and particularly Baltimore City.  BaltimoreLink, by any metric has been an abject failure- it is inadequate, confusing to riders, and treats Baltimore citizens like second class passengers.  Transit failures, as evidenced by the recent shutdown of the Baltimore area Metro, demonstrate the inadequate transit options of our region.    We must provide commuters access to mass transit beyond buses; in order for Baltimore to realize its true economic capacity, automobiles and rural votes cannot continue to be the focus of the State transportation policy.",".   I believe the legalization of marijuana is coming to Maryland, however there is much work to be done before I would be comfortable voting for such a bill.  In particular, studies are clear that the effects of marijuana on a minor's developing brain is very harmful.  I would need to see strong protections to ensure marijuana would not be readily available to children.  Additionally, Maryland has the benefit of learning from other states, including neighboring jurisdictions, where legalization has occurred and take the time to fully study the impacts of those laws on the public health, safety and economies in those states.   Finally, the effects of new strains and variations of marijuana products is quickly evolving, and I would need more information about the checks and balances on those products to ensure the safety of Maryland public.     The criminalization of marijuana has had devastating and inequitable consequences for racial and ethnic minorities, more specifically, black neighborhoods.   As we move toward legalization, we must fully resolve how we treat individuals serving time for marijuana possession, use and sale, as well as have an open debate on how to address the ongoing stigma marijuana arrests have on black citizens.","Maryland has an obligation to protect our most valuable natural resources.  We must remain vigilant in funding those items and making sure that the enforcement continues.  Also, environmental protections are crucial to the Chesapeake Bay.  As a result of the Trump budget cuts, legislators must remain vigilant in restoring and maintaining funding for any cuts associated with monitoring pollutants in soil and air, water quality testing and wild life monitoring, environmental modeling, Bay cleanup efforts and best management practices.   In spite of the Trump cuts, the EPA can take action to make sure pollution reduction targets under the Chesapeake Bay Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) are met by increasing oversight, redirecting grants, denying the issuance of specified permits, or other enforcement actions.  However, an amendment was attached to the budget as passed by the House of Representative restricted the EPA enforcement authority, prohibiting the EPA from taking enforcement action against Bay jurisdictions if a state does not meet the reduction required of the TMDL.","During the 2018 Legislative Session, the Maryland General Assembly approved the passage of SB1267/HB1795 which allowed the continuation of the healthcare exchange program.  This enabled Maryland citizen to continue enrolling in the MD Healthcare Exchange program at a more affordable rate.  This allows the low and moderate citizens to continue to participate and receive affordable healthcare benefits.    We need to follow the template that the Obama Administration set forth, which is healthcare benefits for all.  SB1267/HB1795 is designed to mitigate the impact of high-risk individuals on rates in the individual insurance market.  Beginning January 1, 2019, funding for reinsurance through the program may be made by using any pass-through funds received from the federal government to be utilized to reduce the cost of healthcare","Effective crime suppression must cross jurisdictional lines; the problems faced by any individual jurisdiction must be the concern of all Marylanders.  Enforcement is a reaction to crime.  The State has the ability to do a tremendous amount through parole and probation coordination and spearheading inter-jurisdictional task forces, such as warrant and apprehension units, auto-theft taskforces, and weapon/narcotics interception and enforcement units.   Working with Commissioner Desousa to supplement the Baltimore Police Department's efforts at violence reduction is essential and can be quickly accomplished though the dedication of existing resources and adequate education.   The best crime prevention strategies must focus on ending the cycles of poverty which plague too many Maryland families.  Zip codes should not determine access to academic excellence.  As the Chair of the Senate Education, Health and Environmental Affairs Committee, I will continue to work with Chair, Delegate Maggie McIntosh to leverage our leadership positions to improve City schools and fight for Baltimore's children.  I am also working to provide Baltimore residents, and all Maryland citizens, access to affordable education beyond high school.  House Bill 16, similar to Senate Bill 317, which I co-sponsored alongside my Vice Chair Paul Pinsky, will provide substantial financial support and scholarships for Maryland's community college students.  This legislation provides real, accessible education and training options for Baltimore residents, which is why I shepherded through my Committee in the final days of the Legislative Session.","We need an affordable and efficient transportation system and the State must commit  to a continuous investment in affordable housing development, increase funding to live where you work, to attract qualified, skilled and well-educated employees.  No doubt, we need to continue to invest in our infrastructure to improve our quality of education and our public school facilities.  In addition, a tremendous boost to the business climate in Baltimore would be substantially enhanced with tax incentives from the State.  With these investments, we will continue to attract and retain the tax paying citizens in the great City of Baltimore.   Our great  City of Baltimore embodies  world renowned medical facilities, cultural institutions, excellent higher educational institutions and tremendous sport facilities.","Yes.   No citizen, regardless of party registration or ethnic background, should have their vote diluted resulting from political gerrymandering.  Currently, the State of Maryland has criteria and guidelines for drawing legislative districts, inclusive of compact contiguous with specific populations in each district, with a plus and minus deviation factor.  However, the most troubling and problematic issue associated with redistricting has been attributed to the drawing of congressional districts which lack such specificity and guidelines.  Therefore, the question remains, if this issue should be resolved at the Federal or State level?  If the Federal Government fails to act, I feel it is incumbent upon the State to resolve issues relevant to gerrymandering.  If the solution is an independent commission, so be it.","Police accountability and effective crime suppression is not an either/or proposition but must go hand in hand.   The Law Enforcement Officer's Bill of Rights (LEOBR) was enacted to ensure police officers receive appropriate due process prior to discipline or termination and, provides a good balance for the protection of police and the public.  Changes to the current law can improve the LEOBR.   I am supportive of 2 trained citizens being a part of the trial board, this allows for transparency and balance.  Additionally, I support allowing internal investigations to utilize one-way consent for wire taps of officers for use solely in administrative proceedings.  Citizens who are placed in a position to judge the appropriateness of an officer's actions must fully understand the jobs that officers are required to do and the environment in which they work.    Stripping a police officer of due process is not the answer to effectively addressing police corruption.   We must take police integrity seriously from the initial hiring process throughout the promotional policies of agencies.   Police officers in Baltimore have to be trained annually on the application of the Fourth Amendment and the Court's evolving view of how stop, search and seizures can be legally effectuated. Police agencies must ensure that they staff their internal affairs units with experienced, honest and effective detectives, capable of providing fair and thorough investigations.  Jurisdictions need to be cautious at the negotiation table to ensure they do not make concessions which slants the process contrary to the public interest.","During the MGA 2017/18 Legislative Sessions, there were a mirage of proposed legislation addressing the opioid crisis and addiction ranging from the investigation and prosecution of pill mills, restrictions associated with limitations on opioid prescriptions, policies relating to heroin and opioid addiction and prevention, and establishing a prescription and drug monitoring program to identify prescription drug abuse and the investigation of unlawful drug diversion.   There is a need for legislators and the General Assembly to receive reports of the benefits of the legislation currently passed to protect and inform the constituents of the effectiveness of the legislation that has been currently enacted before we introduce additional legislation.  There should be a collaboration/negotiation between all local health departments to track opioid use, addiction and prevention.  Additionally, physicians are providing signage and notification to patients as to the detriment of these drugs.  Grant funding is available through legislation that provide state-wide treatment to address opioid/heroin addiction.  In the past, treatment centers were primarily located within Baltimore City.  Due to the stigma associated with treatment, many, if not most, of the jurisdictions would not provide these service.","I support raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour to help working men and women meet their basic needs.  Working men and women need honest wages for honest work.    We must also ensure that employers do not continue the discriminatory trend of underpaying women, particularly women of color, for the same work their male counterparts perform.  Maryland has many good wage and hour protections on the books, however the Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation (DLLR) simply does not have the resources to investigate violations and enforce these laws.  Adequate enforcement mechanisms are essential to ensuring workers' rights and will do more to correct wrongful employers than enacting arbitrary new requirements without the ability to properly enforce them.   We must adequately fund DLLR through proper budgeting and fine structures for intentional wrong-doers.","The Maryland Public Information Act and open meetings laws give clear direction to public officials for how the public's business should be conducted, communicated and reviewed.  However, enforcing these laws requires time consuming litigation and expense when the initial request is summarily dismissed.  The legislature, with the assistance and guidance of Attorney General Brian Frosh, in conjunction with the public and journalistic stakeholders should work to pass legislation to ensure a more streamlined judicial review process for PIA disputes.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

University of Baltimore School of Law B.A. Johns Hopkins University,Attorney practicing in Maryland since 1988 Former Army officer,"Everyone wants top quality public education and most of the Commission's goals are worthy of support.  The challenge is in the funding – simply demanding more money ""for the children"" is insufficient.  As public officials, we have to go much further to justify the expense.  Taxpayers are justifiably wary of sending additional money to the State to redistribute among the counties and Baltimore City.  Taxpayers are well aware, for example, that Baltimore City receives three times the amount shared with most other counties and that the results of that generous spending are abysmal.  A number of other jurisdictions are also lacking in the effective utilization of taxpayers' dollars.  Government must clearly demonstrate that additional funding for education is absolutely necessary to improve quality and not simply to make up for taxes lost through gross inefficiency, waste, fraud, and malfeasance.  Citizens are right to demand full accountability.","Neither roads nor transit gets the amount of funding needed.   It is important to recognize that we are a very diverse state and that the transportation needs in Montgomery County are very different from those in Harford and Cecil Counties, for example and that the needs vary greatly within each jurisdiction.   The D.C. area jurisdiction moves very large numbers of people to a relatively compact area so an extensive investment in transit makes sense.  A similar level of transit in the rest of the state is more difficult to support where the employment is far less centralized.   As the state continues to grow and change, it is important that elected officials try to understand and appreciate the very diverse interests of all parts of our state.  Because of that diversity, there will always be a constant tension as we struggle to find the correct balance.  That is not bad; it is just hard to do.","Maryland has already decriminalized the use and possession of small amounts of marijuana.  The issue now, is do we go further and if so, how fast and how far.   Is wholesale and immediate decriminalization in the public interest?  Reliable studies on the societal and individual impacts of recreational marijuana have been hampered by its illegality.  As more states legalize, the number or very reputable studies is expanding.    Those studies, including studies from the University of Maryland and NIH, are raising a lot of serious concerns.   We also lack the ability to conduct on the spot tests to determine levels of intoxication as we currently have to test for alcohol intoxication.   Before we fully address the issue of decriminalization, I would like a greater opportunity to examine all of the data that is beginning to emerge from those states that have volunteered to serve as our national test cases for legalization.","The federal government's commitment to the Chesapeake Bay has always been questionable.  That is obvious from the fact that despite many political changes in D.C. over  the past five  decades, the overwhelming majority of Bay pollution continues to run in from Pennsylvania and New York.  That is because those states have far more political power than Maryland at the national level and are able to avoid responsibility for their polluted runoff.  Maryland enacts laws and spends substantial sums to protect the Bay locally only to have those efforts greatly diminished by pollution from neighboring states.  We must stay the course locally and work at all levels of government to significantly expand our impact in Congress and in direct dealings with other states.","The majority of Marylanders would be well served by a strong, private healthcare marketplace.  Those who for a variety of reasons are not well served by the private sector should be afforded state subsidized healthcare.  What we should not do is undermine the success and efficiency of the private sector providers in a misguided effort to make them also serve a quasi-governmental function.   In the short term, we have to continue to work with the system we have to avoid catastrophic results of a failed system.","The most important role the state can play in reducing violent crime in Baltimore is to help City residents understand the root causes of that crime: fatherless children, under performing schools, an anti-business bias in City government that leads to a shortage of employment opportunities for young people and for those who are academically challenged, and a criminal justice system that appears more interested in the perpetrators than the victims.","The current business climate is quite favorable to white collar jobs.  We still have much further to go in our efforts to expand employment opportunities in manufacturing and other blue collar jobs.  We are leaving a large sector of our population on the sidelines of economic opportunity.  We have a limited number of employers whose business model presents ample opportunities for young, inexperienced, and less educated workers.  Rather than targeting those employers with the burdens of mandatory minimum wages and other benefit mandates, the costs of assisting low income workers with rent, healthcare, food and the like should be shared by all taxpayers.  If the voters support increased benefits, those should be paid from the general tax revenues and not taken solely from those employers willing  to take the business risk of employing the minimally skilled.",Yes.,The LEOBR strikes an appropriate balance.  There have been numerous misguided efforts from the Baltimore City to undo that balance.    The LEOBR protections do not support bad policing and removing or reducing these protections will only serve to discourage quality police officers from serving in the City.,"The state is on the right course now.  We have expanded opportunities for treatment, expanded emergency medical care, increased prosecution of illegal distribution, expanded emergency training, reduced prescriptions, and expanded drug education in schools and at work.  This comprehensive approach is succeeding  and those results are a testament to the power of good, hardworking people to make a difference.",We have to expand job opportunities for those who for a variety of reasons are not suited to white collar employment.,"The laws are meaningless without enforcement.  We need to expand enforcement of open meeting laws.   PIA requests would, in most cases, be unnecessary if public information was effectively posted on the internet.   We are seeing expanding access to public information via the internet.  That effort has got to continue at an accelerated pace.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

In Frederick County, our priority is the expansion of the I-270 Corridor, in order for us to connect to employment hubs in Montgomery County and DC. We have been waiting more than 20 years for the widening project and have no draft plans for expanded mass transit (Metro) to Frederick. Expansion of mass transit, either in Baltimore or DC suburbs, pays for itself in air quality improvement, less congestion, and quality of life. Currently, no jurisdiction is adequately served by transit. We need more help from our federal partners since Maryland continues to be a fast-growing state.","Yes. We have effectively created a ""legal"" use of marijuana when the State decriminalized its use in small quantities. Marylanders support the legalization of recreational use and we can take advantage of the economic and social benefits at the same time. If we legalize marijuana, we can regulate it for safety; tax it to benefit education, health care, and transportation; reduce police costs of enforcement; and reduce the costs to the courts and jails. We can look at the best practices of other states to avoid mistakes of the transition from ""de-criminalized"" to ""legal.""","As a former mayor, I know the local cost of storm water management is budget-busting. Maryland Department of the Environment is helpful with making grants/loans available, as a State Senator, I will push for funds to remain available to local governments. The Chesapeake Bay Foundation has introduced Environmental Impact Bonds to help local governments pay for local projects that are effective and proven to improve the green infrastructure in Maryland. I will introduce a professional internship program for recent graduates with degrees in forestry, environmental studies, etc. to manage, protect and maintain the Frederick Watershed and Monocacy River. Once the model is proven, we can expand it to target other regions.","We should continue to support Maryland Health Connection with four target audiences: Basic Health Care for Individuals and Families; Veteran Care; Aging and Senior Populations; and Special Needs (ranging from chronic illnesses to Alzheimers). By understanding the cost of no/inadequate care,the legislature can focus its work on funding streams and minimizing legislative red tape that hampers the health care delivery system. By performing financial analysis on the impacts of no/inadequate care, we can better invest in solutions for health care.","The State should not be interfering in the operation of local government operations unless requested by the Mayor/Council or required by Consent Orders. The State can help all Marylanders by addressing the expansion of opioids/heroin, human trafficking, and gang violence. What municipalities need is a source of funding for police training, closed circuit tv cameras, and Drug Court options that minimize the demands on the Courts.","Businesses come to Maryland because of the strong economy, they do not come because we are free of red tape. I am a small business owner, some of the requirements are outdated, tedious, and unnecessary. On the up side, we are a relatively safe, clean, and successful state with many benefits: a well-regarded educational system, adequate public transit, good health care options, varied entertainment/recreational options. The State should continue to use its economic development tools to focus on strong jobs in life sciences, business services, and hospitality. Now, the State is bundling a multi-billion dollar offer for Amazon, which has the promise of creating jobs with six-figure salaries. In addition, the State should continue to support and expand home-ownership tools to assist young people, public-sector employees, and veterans to buy homes in Maryland.","Yes. The ""tribal"" nature of today's politics has been detrimental to our system and we have to take steps to repair it. By putting the decision into the hands of residents, it will still be political, but the ability to micro-target will be severely limited.","The LEOBR is a good tool to protect police officers under investigation, but it has not been updated to address public concerns. I support more opportunities for public review - a Civilian Review Board - to improve oversight and trust.","It's a health crisis that has a crime component. We have put so much of the burden on police officers and first responders that we have been slow to develop adequate counseling and residential care facilities. My focus will be on creating a 24-7 drop-in center in Frederick as a pilot program for a professional internship opportunity. We will recruit recent graduates with degrees in counseling, social work, etc. to operate the center under the supervision of the Health Department, State's Attorney Office, and local health care providers. It will serve a double purpose - offering professional development opportunities for young professionals and providing a safe, counseling place for recovering addicts.","While the State cannot require businesses to pay more than the minimum wage or provide more paid time off, it can make sure that State employees are fairly compensated with adequate, competitive benefits. State contractors must also be held to a standard of fair pay and benefits so that we reward companies that value their employees and add to the economic strength of the state.","The burden of proving a violation of Maryland Open Meetings' Act and sifting through the requirements of the Public Information Act do not favor transparency and openness. The Public Information Act is designed to provide the public an opportunity to see the documents used by public officials in their decision-making, but often, the public does not know exactly what to request. Further, the Act is expensive, giving the false impression that the cost to produce documents is high. In fact, by transmitting materials electronically, makes the cost negligible. Finally, the timing of responses from the government allow extended time to pass, sometimes preventing the public from being able to make informed objections to public decisions.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

I am committed to funding early childhood education, teacher quality and teacher preparation, integrated college and career pathways, school finance equity, and more resources for at-risk students, as recommended by the Commission. Certainly, adding the revenue from casino gaming to the State's education budget will help to fund these initiatives. Voters must approve the Fix the Fund constitutional amendment in November, adding an estimated $500 million to the state's budget for public schools.","All Marylanders should have access to public transportation. Urban residents need mass transit. Suburban residents need increased commuting options. Rural residents need public transit options to navigate daily needs. Toll lanes on high-volume roadways create revenue, but also increase car traffic. If Maryland creates toll lanes, they should also be designated for electric-powered busses in order to streamline and encourage public transportation. Widening major roadways is a short-term fix, in my view. Encouraging more cars on the roadways is not a sustainable path forward. The state needs to set aside money in the transportation budget to revamp public transit.",Yes. The recreational marijuana industry stands to take in billions of dollars every year in the United States. Only nine states are taking advantage of the jobs and opportunities associated with that growth. Maryland should use the tax revenue made available from legalization to fund education initiatives and infrastructure needs.,"We have made great strides in bringing back to health the Chesapeake and the Potomac. We cannot rest. Maintaining the health of these watersheds requires constant vigilance, especially in the wake of our current EPA administration. Maryland needs to commit to funding what the federal government won't: namely the Chesapeake Bay Program, the Clean Air Act, and the Clean Water Act.",A lack of access is the root of health care challenges in Maryland. Every Marylander deserves access to affordable quality health care. Preventative care is more cost effective than the emergency care that results from lack of preventative care. Access to quality health care must also include access to affordable addiction rehabilitation. Legislators must oppose healthcare cuts and expand Medicare through a single-payer healthcare system.,"The state should support the training of police officers in de-escalation. The state should also subsidize programs that encourage young people to join the force in their own communities. Finally, fully funding education initiatives like early childhood education and community schools would provide much-needed resources to areas of concentrated poverty, which have been proven to reduce violent crime.","With Amazon showing real interest in building another headquarters in Montgomery County, it seems as if big businesses are already encouraged in Maryland. The state needs to ensure that large corporations that operate here offer paid family leave, full-time employment opportunities, and good wages.",Yes.,"As a public school teacher, I know what it means to serve the public. As a public school teacher, I have encountered a handful of dangerous situations. Police Officers encounter dangerous situations while interacting with the public more often than most, and the protections granted to every citizen under the Bill of Rights in the Constitution should be the only Bill of Rights necessary.",Expanding health care coverage should also include access to affordable addiction rehabilitation.,"Fully funding education is paramount. If the state of Maryland can reduce the opportunity gap through robust public education, it can also reduce income inequality by providing enhanced opportunities for the traditionally marginalized.

Half my career was as a formal educator (i.e., tech training instructor/evaluator, undergraduate professor & Dept Chair, graduate-level visiting lecturer, executive wargaming facilitator).","As an experienced educator, I am generally supportive of the Commission's recommendations. As a conservative, I am wary of vague funding proposals without accompanying objectives and measures of performance. I found numerous flaws within the preliminary report, but am still working my way through the cited sources, which may resolve my concerns. I would take the recommendations a step further to create a new Maryland Student-Parent-Teacher Covenant that drives excellence in education, gives deference to parental values and authorities, elevates the role of educators, and promotes mutual respect between and among all three participants. As for funding, the State's gaming revenues - provided Democrats do not siphon them all away for ideologically-driven pork like scholarships for illegal aliens - provides a ready starting point. In addition, the business growth throughout the State - championed by Governor Hogan - that expands the tax base is always the underpinning necessary to resource innovation.","The balance should be less about spending and more about region-appropriate types of infrastructure. I am concerned western Maryland's transportation needs are not being met or represented. Over-emphasis on funding public transportation projects is not necessarily the right solution set for Marylanders who live well-outside the I-95 corridor. As a METRO commuter myself, I am acutely aware of the negative toll being limited to public transportation takes on family quality-of-life. As to Baltimore-specific concerns, my focus has been the transportation concerns of the constituents of northern Montgomery County, and I have not met with Baltimore officials.","I am an evidence-driven individual. While I have opposed drug use - including marijuana - throughout my life, I accept societal views are shifting. For me to support the legalization of recreational marijuana, the following would need to be in place: - FDA studies certifying marijuana to be no less healthy or safe, both short and long term, than tobacco or alcohol - Laws in place to address public consumption & impairment comparable to those for alcohol (e.g., DUI, public ""intoxication,"" etc.) - Policies that prevent marijuana use from impeding the rights of non-users (e.g., designated smoking/no-smoking areas, prevention of second-hand effects, etc.)","I am currently reading Maryland Sea Grant's report on the impact of sea level rise on the Chesapeake, ""Come High Water,"" and believe strategic planning must begin today to mitigate the effects of sea rise. All efforts we take today to continue Chesapeake Bay restoration will be for nought if sea level rise, coastal erosion, etc. re-injects pollutants into the Bay. I am a strategic planner by military background, and my focus will be long-term sustainability in a time of climate change, depending at all times on experts in the field to guide that planning.","The recent bipartisan effort from Annapolis to aid Marylanders struggling to meet rising health care premiums should be applauded. However, such efforts will never be enough if costs are not also controlled. Maryland should lead the way in conducting a comprehensive cost analysis that could underpin legislative efforts to begin to address the costs that actually drive health care to be unaffordable and difficult to access.","The State must partner with the city of Baltimore to find solutions, and then assist with resourcing those solutions. Governor Hogan has been a strong advocate for doing so. Beyond that, I am not prepared to offer more without consulting law enforcement experts.","Maryland's business climate has grown demonstrably better over the past four years, growing from within and attracting new businesses from outside the state. Under Governor Hogan, we turned the state around. There remain some pockets, such as Montgomery County, experiencing difficulty attracting and growing new businesses - and even losing some. Our efforts to improve transportation infrastructure, education, and other quality of life issues are attractive to both business owners and employees' families. We can go further by working to lower the cost of living in this region by fighting to lower taxes and to promote our small businesses to grow by further reducing regulatory burdens. Such efforts are the hallmark of Republicans, and are not generally pursued by Democrats.","YES! I fully endorse the Marlyand Commission on Redistricting Reform recommendations, as has Governor Hogan. Ending gerrymandering is the primary reason I entered the race. Redrawing districts following each census is an obligation of the State in its responsibility to promote and maintain fair representation by accounting for population shifts. Unfortunately, Maryland Democrats treated the effort like a spoil of war, redrawing districts based not on population shifts, but likely voting preferences. As a voter and a citizen, that angers me. I oppose gerrymandering regardless of party at fault. I reject the effort of my opponent, Mr. Zucker, to protect the status quo by authoring a bill he knew would not go anywhere and which only serves his party's national interests to keep Maryland blue over fair representation for Marylanders. I reject the efforts admitted to by former Governor O'Malley to draw districts for the purpose of improving Democrats chances of winning another House seat. Think about this: Mr. Delaney, should he be successful in his Presidential bid, will owe his rise to prominence in the public eye directly and exclusively to unethical gerrymandering. Maryland is far more ""purple"" than it is blue or red.","I have not yet reviewed the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights, so I must withhold judgment.","Strategically, we need to focus on the sources of opioid promotion and stronger methods for abuse prevention and detection. Tactically, we should consider stricter controls on availability and un-monitored use. I am encouraged by the Governor's efforts to elevate this issue and look forward to supporting recommendations that comes from those efforts.","I fully support free-market capitalism, which will always result in some level of income inequality. Recognizing that Governments have never demonstrated the ability to effectively manage tax dollars over the long-term, and that society has rightly assumed an obligation to provide a safety net for those unable to effectively compete in the market place to escape poverty, our focus should be programs that emphasize catch-and-release whenever possible. In paraphrasing Lincoln, I do not believe we should seek to raise up a people by tearing down those who succeed. Therefore, the State should not vilify those who have succeeded. Rather, they should be incentivized by the State to willingly provide greater support through the private sector to help those still rising.","Only insofar as our elected officials respect and adhere to both the letter and spirit of the laws. Recent Democrat leadership meetings and votes taken during the legislative session behind closed doors, and efforts to reduce transparency demonstrate a lack of respect and deference to Marylanders. In this light, the laws do need to be strengthened to ensure greater transparency. However, doing so is not in the political interests of the dominant party. Such actions will only be corrected by changing the people we send to Annapolis in November.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

Served as the Government Affairs Director for the National Aquarium, where she advocated for legislation to help protect the Chesapeake Bay and protect local wildlife. As an advocate for the Aquarium, Sarah successfully secured funding for capital projects and funding to allow hundreds of thousands of Maryland schoolchildren to visit the Aquarium free of charge, and worked to expand access to the Aquarium for all Marylanders. She later Senior Director of University Projects at Margrave Strategies, Sarah worked with universities to implement economic development plans and to revitalize local communities, all while creating 21st century jobs. Sarah currently consults for the National Aquarium, project managing the Marine Conservation District project.","Yes, I fully support the findings and recommendations of the Kirwan Commission. Every child deserves to have access to a high-quality public education. I am committed to expanding technical and career education to prepare kids for 21st century jobs, increasing teacher salaries to keep experience in our classrooms, and investing in universal pre-kindergarten. Strong schools are the foundation for strong and growing communities. We should examine all funding avenues available.","District 30 is a bedroom community with a majority of workers commuting outside of the district every day, particularly to Baltimore City and Washington, DC, and currently, there are not enough reliable and clean methods of mass transportation available to District 30 residents. That results in increased pollution, traffic jams, and stymied economic opportunity; problems which could be reduced significantly through the implementation of improved public transit systems. I would support increased rapid transportation projects that better connect residents to job opportunities. Any increase in public transportation options are only as effective as the public's level of awareness; thus, I would support legislation for funding public awareness campaigns to increase ridership.","I supported the legalization of medical marijuana, and I supported the decriminalization of small amounts of marijuana. I believe we need to look at all the benefits and drawbacks that would accompany the full legalization of marijuana. Any study that looks at legalizing marijuana must examine the revenue that can be raised, the threats to public health, and any other societal impacts.","The Chesapeake Bay is our greatest natural resource, our economic engine, and key to our way of life. Maryland has made tremendous progress in restoring and protecting the Bay over the last forty years, but overdevelopment, pollution, climate change, and sea level rise present significant threats that require local solutions. We must continue to promote the health and growth of oysters in the Chesapeake Bay, further Maryland's use of green energy sources, protect forests and critical areas, and incentivize best management practices for farms.","Access to affordable, quality healthcare is a fundamental right. Maryland has always been a leader on affordable, accessible, innovate healthcare, but we need to make sure our healthcare system works for all Marylanders. We must look at creating a Medicaid buy-in for all Maryland residents to help stabilize the health care marketplace. We can reduce health disparities, improve access to underserved communities, and build healthier communities by supporting innovative access to community-based healthcare. And we must expand home healthcare services that allow seniors to age in place.","Maryland has some of the strongest gun safety laws in the United States, but we must do more to guarantee that guns do not fall into the hands of dangerous individuals. We need to increase background checks before people are able to purchase firearms. But we can not only focus on the punishment side of crime. I am an active member of ""Eastport Working Together"" - a community group focused on job creation, youth intervention, and increasing education and public health services - which was formed as a response to increased violent crime in Annapolis. Addressing crime does not start or end with addressing public safety - it includes holistic approaches to systemic challenges facing our communities.","There is always more that we can do to make it easier for businesses to open and thrive in Maryland. One of the most important things we can do is make sure there is a trained workforce available for all businesses, from childcare centers to the maritime trades. I will support legislation to allow individuals to attend community college tuition-free, re-train workers who lose their jobs to automation and outsourcing, and to respond to the rapid changes in our economy.",Yes.,"We must have the highest standards for our law enforcement officers while simultaneously providing higher wages, better training, and easier access to necessary mental health services. More can be done to hold bad actors accountable so that they are not able to harm their colleagues's ability to do their job safely and responsibly. I support the use of body cameras and further oversight of our police departments so that there is greater transparency to the communities they serve.","The opioid epidemic touches nearly every family in District 30. This isn't a partisan issue, it's a public health crisis. We must act now and rise to meet the challenge. We need to increase funding for residential treatment centers, invest in the continuum of care for those in recovery, and make it easier to report doctors who are over-prescribing opioids.","Public education is the great equalizer in our society. We have to ensure that every Maryland family has access to some form of higher education, whether that is a community college, technical school, or a four-year institution. We need to make it easier for parents to afford childcare so they are able to work and raise their families. I support raising Maryland's minimum wage so that people who work full-time are able to support themselves and their family.","I believe that Maryland is ahead of the curve when it comes to ability of the general public to be involved in its government. But more must be done, I support live-video of floor proceedings in the Maryland General Assembly, as well as video access to committee voting sessions.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

The Commission's work has been extended for one additional year year and I look forward to reviewing those recommendations later in 2018.","I believe Maryland's transportation spending is appropriately balanced. This Session, I was the lead Senate Sponsor of the historic Maryland Metro Funding Act, SB 277. The bill provides the DC Metro system with a bondable, dedicated funding stream for the first time, the only system of its size in the nation without one. At the same time, the bill redirected critically needed dollars to the Baltimore region's transit needs. In addition, in order to make our scarce transportation dollars go further, I look forward to some of the innovative public private partnership proposals the Governor is currently exploring in the DC region along the I-270/I-495 Corridor.","Yes. During the 2017 Session, I introduced legislation that would put the issue on the November 2018 statewide ballot. Under the legislation, which did not pass, the tax revenues collected on sales would be earmarked for public education, school construction, substance abuse programs, and mental health services.","The Trump administration and the current EPA appear determined to zero out funding for the $73 million Chesapeake Bay Program, a critical part of the comprehensive strategy deployed over the past decade that has been successful in cleaning up the Bay. Not only is the program important to protect the Bay, a national treasure, it is vitally important to Maryland's economy to have a vibrant Bay. If funding for that program is eliminated, the State would be left with no choice but to step up with State funds to buttress the program.","As Chair of the Health Subcommittee in the Senate and Senate Chair of Maryland's Health Insurance Coverage Protection Commission, I spent a great deal of time on this topic during the 2018 Session. I introduced the Protect Maryland Health Care Act of 2018, SB 1011, an innovative proposal that takes components of the Affordable Care Act and Romneycare in Massachusetts but injects additional ideas designed to ensure the broadest possible access to affordable health care. I look forward to reintroducing the legislation in the 2019 Session.","This a complicated question that does not lend itself to a simple answer but the state can play a critical and constructive role. The State must first do what it can to reduce the achievement gap, improve Baltimore's schools, and provide greater access to higher education for those living in the parts of Baltimore that remain economically depressed. Moreover, the state must to do all that it can to ensure that Baltimore thrives economically, and that economic opportunities and benefits realized in Baltimore are spread to the entire population.","I believe that Maryland's business climate is strong, but could be improved. Among other things, we must do more to address our traffic congestion problem which continues to hinder economic growth. In general, Maryland is a wealthy state, has a highly educated workforce, and outstanding public institutions of higher learning. For these reasons, our unemployment rate currently sits at only 4.2% and companies like Amazon are looking to locate a major presence in the state. As for fostering the creation of more family supporting jobs, I believe that we made strides this year in Annapolis with passage of ""Sick and Safe Leave"" law and other leave related proposals for state employees which support families.",Yes.,I do not serve on the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee and do not feel that I have sufficient information to be able to respond to this question adequately.,"Over the past several sessions, the General Assembly has passed a comprehensive package of bills to address the opoid addiction and overdose crisis, ranging from requirements that doctors log into a database to review prescription histories of patients before prescribing, to funding for hotlines, and other services. This session, I introduced and secured passage of legislation directed at the disposal of opoids to better ensure that opoids do not end up in the wrong hands. However, in order to really make a dent in the problem, we need to try new innovative solutions that take us out of our political comfort zones. One such legislative proposal that I introduced this Session would have set up a Pilot Program where addicts could go to a safe consumption site that has medical staff and other wrap around services on the premises. This concept is working in several other states and would work in Maryland if given an opportunity. The bill did not pass but I plan to reintroduce it in the 2019 Session.",The key is to expand access to higher education in the impacted communities since securing a college degree remains the best predictor of one's prospects for employment and higher earning capacity.,Yes.,"Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

Formerly: Special Assistant to the CEO, Baltimore City Public Schools. Currently: Director of Reform Initiatives, Office of the Dean, Johns Hopkins School of Education.","Implementing the Kirwan Commission's visionary framework for public schools in Maryland will be the single most important issue we address during the next term of the General Assembly. Recently released Maryland NAEP scores from 2017 highlight the urgency of this work. Maryland is one of the wealthiest states in the richest countries in the world, yet our public school students are scoring in the middle of the pack in the U.S. in math and reading, even worse when compared globally. This is completely unacceptable and avoidable. The Kirwan Commission's recommendations rely heavily on the 9 Building Blocks of World Class Education Systems as developed by the National Council on Education and the Economy. We know what we need to do to create a more equitable and successful environment for public school outcomes, yet the ultimate question remains whether we have the political will to do it. A grand compromise is required. Additional state funding will be required, and we will have to engage in broad tax reform – particularly as it relates to the sales tax – to create the sustainable revenue streams necessary to uphold the opportunity. Yet, we must be willing to incorporate genuine and meaningful accountability measures and leverage points to ensure that additional funding is tied to associated outcome gains. I ran for office in 2010 for this purpose, and, if reelected, I intend to fully dedicate my service in office next term to achieving the potential the Kirwan Commission presents.","No. Our state, and more specifically the Baltimore region, wholly lacks a coherent vision and plan for public transportation. We are currently investing too heavily in an automobile-based transportation system, and we are falling behind our peer regions. With the passage of the gas tax increase in 2013, we have sufficient funds at the state-level to provide a more comprehensive transportation vision, and we have sufficient funds to implement it. BaltimoreLink has been an objective failure, resulting in a net decrease in transit ridership since implementation. Furthermore, the current Administration has an unbalanced focus on building roads and highways instead of focusing on how to most effectively and efficiently move people and goods. During the 2018 Session, the General Assembly worked to bolster capital improvement funds for WMATA metro. Concurrently, the Maryland Transit Administration (MTA) shut down the Baltimore subway for a month for emergency repairs. The juxtaposition is clear. We worked with our colleagues from the Washington area to ensure that investments in WMATA accompanied a new plan and new investments for transit in the Baltimore region. At passage, the legislation authorizing a long-term commitment to WMATA included three important provisions: (1) mandated annual funding increases for MTA's operating budget, (2) development of a new long-range transportation plan for the Baltimore region, and (3) a requirement for MTA to develop a comprehensive capital improvement plan for existing transportation assets. During the next term, it will be essential that we hold MTA and MDOT accountable to these commitments.","Yes. Should we move forward and legalize recreational marijuana, we must be intentional in our regulatory systems, learning from both the best practices and mistakes other states have experienced. We should allocate the revenues from taxation of marijuana to the Education Trust Fund for the purposes of funding Kirwan Commission reforms for Maryland's public schools.","The federal government's retreat from environmental protections for our air and water is severe and will have lasting impacts for Maryland. Where the federal government withdraws, Maryland must fill the void more urgently. We can do this most efficiently by rigorously enforcing existing laws aimed at protecting our State's most critical natural resource, the Chesapeake Bay. Under the O'Malley Administration, we passed significant legislation to protect our Bay with phosphorus management plans, stormwater management fees, and limits on the use of septic systems in new developments. Over the last four years, the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) has relented on enforcement and shifted operations towards accommodation. Similarly, the State's Department of Planning has suffered from absent leadership and a full retreat from active management of sustainable growth policies. To protect our Bay, this must change. As we look forward, we must do more to protect the Bay's oyster population and encourage more sustainable farming practices. We've made reasonable progress with aquaculture, but our oyster populations still lag optimal levels. We should be doing more to protect our State's forests and priority preservation areas. Sprawled development has led to the elimination of Maryland's tree canopy and vegetation, which serve as key buffers to harmful pollutant runoff into the Bay. Over the next term, we must develop a more comprehensive policy to limit deforestation and tree replacement.","Access to basic health care is a right, and Maryland should be a leader on this issue given the remarkable health care assets we have in this State. Unfortunately, the politics of healthcare access hamper our ability to meet our fullest potential. Until we reach a point where a single payer system is feasible, we must protect existing programs and build on recent successes in expanding access and insurance coverage. Specifically, we must protect Maryland's Medicaid waiver. This waiver ensures hospitals and healthcare providers have an incentive to focus on population health instead of a fee-for-service delivery model. Losing Maryland's waiver would severely limit health care access across the State. We must also continue to monitor the Affordable Care Act's implementation in Maryland, especially as we've seen the federal government intentionally undercut the law's prior successes in expanding insurance coverage. This year we worked in a bipartisan way to save the individual marketplace, but the fix is temporary. We must make sure that the ACA's insurance marketplace exchange is accessible and affordable with competitive options that benefit Marylanders. I also strongly support the exploration of models to make Medicaid more accessible, as states like New Mexico are considering. Movement towards single payer must be balanced with the realities of today's insurance marketplace, yet I am committed towards ensuring that we are continuously working towards universal health care access for Marylanders.","Ensuring the safety of all Marylanders is a foundational purpose of government. State government has an obligation and duty to work with local officials to reduce violence and create genuine safety in all of Maryland's communities. This past summer, I worked with my fellow 46th District Delegates Luke Clippinger, Brooke Lierman, and Robbyn Lewis to present a framework for reducing violence and creating safe communities in Baltimore City (see: http://www.billforbaltimore.com/baltimore_prospers). I supported the balanced approach the General Assembly took to reduce violence in Baltimore this past Session – investing in prevention while holding repeat violent offenders accountable. Fundamentally, I believe the best crime fighting strategy available is one that approaches violence as a public health crisis and allocates resources towards prevention and diversion, but when individuals choose to repeatedly break laws and victimize communities, they must face tangible consequences. Additionally, I believe the State has a primary responsibility in restoring faith in law enforcement in Baltimore City. The Police Department of Baltimore City is a state agency, and state oversight is essential. This past year, I passed legislation to establish the Commission to Restore Trust in Policing, an investigatory body charged with reviewing the tragic and unacceptable crimes committed for years by the Baltimore Police Department's Gun Trace Task Force. Until we get to the bottom of the abject failure that led to the Gun Trace Task Force's rampage on Baltimore citizens, progress will be impossible. The State must be a partner in helping Baltimore heal and move forward.","Maryland is underperforming our potential. We are a wealthy state with one of the most highly educated populations in the country. Yet, we trail peer states dramatically in formation and sustainability of innovative, high-growth firms. We do not have a clear strategy around leveraging our sectors of competitive advantage like cybersecurity, biotechnology, and robotics. Instead, our economic development model is too reliant on strategies from last century's playbook. We need to get away from the model of throwing incentives at individual companies in a race to the bottom, and focus instead on creating the climate where Maryland companies expand. We do this best by broadly investing in infrastructure improvements, enhancing our education and vocational training pipelines, and creating a better quality of life across the State. We, of course, have to be mindful of Maryland's tax burden to remain competitive overall, but I deeply believe tax rates are a marginal issue in the overall assessment of business climate. Finally, as our economy gets ever more sophisticated and globalized, we must do more to ensure all Marylanders have access to a world class education. Technology is changing the economy and workplace faster than we can keep pace, and we must prepare our State's residents for this changing world by doubling down on our public education systems. The Kirwan Commission's framework offers the State the opportunity meet this challenge, and our State's economy will be the beneficiary if we adopt this vision and hold ourselves accountable to implementing it over time.",Yes.,"In Baltimore City, the practical application of the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights (LEOBR), specifically with regard to the alternative trial board process, likely contributes to ineffective management and oversight of the police department. LEOBR has created an environment in Baltimore where the constraints on disciplining sworn officers likely gave rise to an environment where the Gun Trace Task Force was capable of inflicting years of criminal behavior before facing any consequence. Furthermore, the lack of trust that exists between law enforcement and too many communities in the City serves as a foundational roadblock to creating a genuine sense of safety across Baltimore. There are thousands of Baltimore officers who do their jobs honorably and justly each and every day, putting their lives on the line to serve Baltimore's residents. Yet, instances like the Gun Trace Task Force undermine their work and create a cloud of doubt that permeates the system. The Commission to Restore Trust in Policing is the appropriate vehicle to approach this challenge. By reviewing the series of events associated with the oversight of the GTTF in depth, the Commission provides the process and means to present to the public an objective assessment of the scope of the problem and potential reforms that may be necessary to remediate. I firmly believe that components or application of LEOBR in Baltimore will be a necessary, although not sufficient, subject of recommendations for change.","I was proud to support the General Assembly's evidence-based initiative to address the opioid crisis during the 2017 General Assembly Session with passage of the HOPE Act. We need more resources for this problem, but we need those resources to be appropriated on the basis of evidence-based treatment and with purposeful coordination. Specifically, ongoing strategies must include the basic initiatives provided for in the HOPE Act: -  Enhanced education efforts through crisis hotlines, treatment center access, and opioid abuse resource guides; -  Oversight of controlled dangerous substance registration systems; -  Expansion of the use and scope of drug courts; -  Coordination of local fatality review teams for overdose cases; -  Expanded access to overdose reversal treatments; -  Greater funding for community-based behavioral health providers; and, -  Revision of healthcare providers' discharge protocols in cases of presumed drug abuse. Ultimately, though, effective implementation and program oversight are essential. We have consistently seen the current Administration fail to implement programs with fidelity and effectiveness. Despite the Hogan Administration issuing an executive order labeling the opioid crisis a state of emergency, opioid overdose deaths have only increased. In the first three quarters of 2017 (most recent data available), over 1,700 Marylanders died from unintentional intoxication deaths, a record for Maryland and a nearly 20% increase in overdose deaths from the same time the prior year. We must continue to allocate resources purposely, but we also must hold the executive agencies accountable for failing to address this problem sufficiently.","The growing structural income inequality in Maryland and across the United States signals severe foundational challenges in our economic system. As capital becomes more valuable in a globalized marketplace, and as technology and the robotic revolution further disrupt traditional labor markets, the concentration of wealth has become increasingly segmented. Without major systemic changes in our capital and labor markets, society faces dramatic challenges that have enormous consequences for all parts of daily life. Thus, it is absolutely essential that the State play a role in better preparing Maryland residents for a new economic future while regulating abuses in the free market that perpetuate inequality. Specifically, Maryland should: 1) Comprehensively reform our State's public education system aligned to the Kirwan Commission's framework for world class schools; 2) Move towards publicly funded post-secondary degrees/industry-recognized certificates; 3) Increase the State's minimum wage and index the minimum wage to inflation; 4) Enhance access to high quality early childhood education and childcare opportunities; 5) Enhance the earned income tax credit; 6) Develop stronger industry-aligned career and vocational workforce development programs; 7) Enhance income tax progressivity; 8) Increase transparency and accountability for tax credits and incentive programs; 9) Invest in a better transportation infrastructure to more effectively move people and goods; 10) Increase the availability of affordable housing; and, 11) Enhance low-cost lending opportunities for small businesses, particularly those owned and operated by women and minorities.","While we've made significant strides in making government more open and transparent in recent years, we still have a ways to go. On the front end, we should expand upon Maryland's Open Data Policy through the Open Data Council, a policy I authored and passed in 2014. If documents and materials are public and open by default, concerns about later releases diminish. To do this effectively, we must invest more fully in our information technology infrastructure, as the State remains woefully behind our peer states. Also, we must hold agencies accountable for meeting open data policy targets to tangibly shift the culture of state government. In 2015, we passed legislation related to the Public Information Act and Open Meetings Law to update applicability; enhance training on how these laws apply to public bodies; reduce fees for access where feasible; establish a new compliance board; and, create a new Office of the Public Access Ombudsman under the Office of the Attorney General. We must continue to build on these recent improvements. Finally, as cybersecurity failures and personal data breaches have become ever more prevalent in today's society, the balance of interests between transparency and protecting citizen privacy will become more strained. There is no reason to believe that these two interests are in full conflict, and our most effective work will hinge upon strong policy values guiding a well-maintained regulatory framework. A strong democracy relies on government operations being as open and accessible as possible.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

Policies such as the Justice Reinvestment Act from 2016, that reduce mass incarceration in Maryland can open up hundreds of millions in funding for education that is currently being used to house offenders, many of whom are non-violent offenders who have been jailed because of an outdated approach to treating addiction.","When we look at thriving metropolitan areas around the nation, and global trends in first world countries, there is an ever-present feature in their transportation systems: They invest heavily in fast, clean, reliable, convenient public transportation that residents utilize as a first-choice rather than a last resort. As long as Maryland continues to invest heavily in expanding highways instead of in public transit, Baltimore and its metropolitan area will never be as competitive with other East Coast cities as it could and should be. Investing in public transportation should also entail investing in quality public transportation like fixed rail trains and subways, not just buses. We have the resources that we need to do this; we just have to make a choice to shift our investments from being so highway-centric. And, as reports like the Central Maryland Transportation Alliance's study on commuting in the Baltimore Region make clear, our region is not adequately served by transit.","Yes, and I believe it is important that we be intentional about how the revenue that it generates for the state is spent. For instance, it can and should be used to better fund education and to expand access to healthcare.","There are multiple fronts that can be improved upon here. Both the Bay and Maryland's environment in general would be improved if the state extends its commitment to the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, and increases its goal for reduced emissions under the RGGI. Improving septic regulations for homes located near the Bay is another perennial opportunity to improve the quality of its water, as is working with poultry farmers to help them make feasible transitions to less environmentally harmful systems of waste reduction. We can also improve the health of the fauna in the Bay and its watershed system by combatting invasive species like the Snakehead. Other states have created innovative programs that incentivize the catch of these invasive species, and then use that catch to feed residents who experience food insecurity.","Increased funding for the Maryland Health Exchange is an ever-present option, but we also need to increase the quality of employer-provided healthcare packages, as well as the transparency for the benefits that they provide their customers. Organized labor is a traditional champion on this front, and a natural partner to the state as it works to expand access to healthcare. Subsidies that decrease the cost of prescriptions for seniors are also extremely important, as is expanding access to generic prescriptions that can provide the same benefits at a fraction of the cost.","In July 2017 I authored a letter signed by a majority of my and published by the Baltimore Sun calling for the Governor to deploy State Police, Parole and Probation, and the Department of Juvenile Services to help Baltimore by working with the warrant task force, and using their resources to focus on violent offenses. The State could also staff the Juvenile Booking Facility to return BPD officers to the streets, like it does with Central Booking. The State can also extend patrols and crash investigations by State Police another 5 miles into the City on I-83. When the state takes steps to address the increased levels of violence in Baltimore, it is also important that these steps be made permanently, not as temporary salves that may not be available next year. To that end, permanent and expanded funding in violence interruption programs is a tremendous opportunity for the state to help Baltimore. We made strides on this front in the 2018 legislative session, but that's just the beginning of what a City-State partnership is capable of.","More family-supporting jobs come from regulations that require businesses to pay family-supporting wages and provide family-supporting benefits. We have seen time and again that increasing business profits with tax breaks and corporate welfare doesn't translate into bigger paychecks for the average worker. It just translates into better compensation for owners and high-level executives. A $15 minimum wage, expanding prevailing wage regulations, expanding access to healthcare, and creating more paths to home ownership are the best ways to improve the financial security of the average Marylander. The extreme wealth that Maryland holds compared to other states both in the region and around the nation is a clear indicator that our state's business climate is not ailing. Our problem is that not enough Marylanders are included in that wealth.","Yes, as long as the body is truly non-partisan. We cannot expect Republicans elsewhere to relinquish their hold on redistricting if we are not willing to do the same ourselves, and we sacrifice the moral high ground in the argument by failing to do so. It is important that natural, contiguous communities have unified legislative representation, because dividing neighborhoods and towns into multiple districts has a very negative affect on their ability to influence elected representatives, because it diminishes their voting power within any one legislative district.","No, as subject matter experts like the American Civil Liberties Union routinely explain, LEOBOR is tilted heavily towards protections for police officers, often at the expense of the public. Requiring that civilians be allowed on hearing boards for misconduct in every municipality across the state would be a tremendous step forward for LEOBOR reform. The multi-day buffer before cops are required to give a statement after incidents involving a use of force should also be reduced.","As a lead sponsor of the HOPE Act and the Keep the Door Open Act, I have a long track record of working to treat opioid addiction as a health problem, not a criminal act. Beyond expanding access to health-based treatment, it is important that victims of addiction have access to the wrap around services that will allow them to stabilize their living conditions so that they can move past their addictions. This includes improving their housing security, expanding access to career training and employment onramps, and housing as many of these programs as possible in their local communities. Other cities have also demonstrated that programs like safe-injection sites are an important tool for combatting disease that springs up in conjunction with addiction, and providing addicts with the information they need to begin making positive steps towards treatment.","State Government is perhaps the most important tool that we have to address income inequality. Guaranteeing better wages by supporting a $15 minimum wage and expanding prevailing wage regulations is an important start, but income inequality is debilitating because it also impacts access to healthcare, housing security, and transportation usage. We can help more Marylanders keep more of the money that they earn by expanding healthcare coverage and healthcare subsidies, creating more paths to homeownership and ending housing discrimination via legislation like the HOME Act, and improve access to opportunity by investing in stronger public transportation systems.","The state should have an expanded requirement to proactively report information to the public, and do so via a user-friendly online interface, so that citizens do not have to constantly seek out relevant information about the activities their tax dollars are supporting.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

Over my career I have used these skills to work with fortune 500 companies, governments, and nonprofits around the world to create win-win partnerships for sustainable international development. I have helped grow local agricultural markets, helped government agencies create jobs, advised companies on engaging key stakeholders, and trained hundreds of individuals in partnership building. My most recent role has been as the Americas Regional Director for The Partnering Initiative. https://thepartneringinitiative.org/about-us/staff-and-associates/",I support the findings of the Kirwan Commission and believe that the implementation of those findings is vital to meet the 21st century needs of education in Maryland. I support efforts to bring universal pre-K and a professional pay structure to attract and retain the best educators. The Commission's work so far makes it clear that teachers feel overworked and undervalued. We need to examine our teacher pay to attract the best talent to our school systems and create flexible systems that allow teachers to move within their profession rather than leave it. Increasing teacher pay to better our students will come at a cost; we can afford that by ensuring that gaming revenues are locked into general education funding.,"Our region experiences some of the greatest congestion in the nation. Too many spend too long in their commutes and those who rely on mass transit are underserved. Cancelling the Red Line in Baltimore and forfeiting nearly a billion dollars in federal funding in the process was a mistake. Baltimore needs a full mass transit system and BaltimoreLink is not sufficient. The recent total shut down for emergency repairs to the metro shows that there has been substantial under-funding of mass transit for years. Investment in public transit not only addresses our infrastructure and community development problems, but also serves as a powerful economic engine – creating jobs in transportation and creating greater access to workplaces.","I support Maryland's laws to decriminalize possession and make marijuana available for medical use. Before legalizing marijuana, we need to ensure that rules and regulations as well as the necessary enforcement procedures are prepared for this change. Through studying the experience of other early-adopter states and constructing policy around their experiences, we can properly prepare for the potential impacts on public health, impaired driving, and underage use.","The Chesapeake Bay's health has improved dramatically since the 1960s, however much more remains to be done. The current presidential administration has threatened to rollback funding of this vital regional resource. We must be ready with state funding and efforts that don't rely on federal support, such as expanding incentives for businesses and homeowners, public-private partnerships, and private fundraising for grants programs. Maryland must also work with regional neighbors like Pennsylvania and even New York in reducing their contributions to polluting the Chesapeake Bay. We must prevent future exacerbation of current environmental concerns with sustainable growth. Reforestation, increased permeable surfaces, and investment in pervious surface technology is crucial to storm water management and preventing soil erosion and runoff. We can leverage education, incentives, grant programs, and legislation to change norms on the neighborhood level, so that homeowners use watershed-friendly practices on their own lawns and gardens.","Access to affordable health care is a critical issue in Maryland. The bipartisan bill recently signed by the governor is an important step, creating a reinsurance pool for 2019 financed in part by a tax on health insurers. The intent is to stabilize the individual marketplace by reinsurance funding to reduce premiums. This one-year fix will help curtail rising premiums for 150,000 Marylanders. An important component of the bill is dedicated to studying the long-term stability of the Maryland insurance market and the possibility of reinstituting the individual mandate that expires in 2019. Finding a permanent solution to this one-year fix will be one of the most important goals in 2019 to ensure all Marylanders have access to affordable care.","No single law or program will be able to address violent crime in Baltimore. A complex effort by government, law enforcement and communities is required. We can increase efforts like Safe Streets Baltimore, expand drug and alcohol rehabilitation and clean up blighted buildings. We can encourage police recruitment from within communities and support community policing activities to cement trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve. We must acknowledge, however, that crime is the symptom of larger problems of economic inequality and limited opportunity. Serious investment in education, job training and employment opportunities can break the cycle of poverty and crime.","There is room for growth and improvement in Maryland's business climate, especially for small and medium sized business and entrepreneurs. A well-educated workforce means a stronger business environment. We can expand apprenticeship programs, affordable higher education, vocational training, effective K-12 education, and early childhood education to help cultivate a 21st century workforce. In addition, if we can lower the barriers of entry, we will foster new businesses and create long-term job opportunities for Marylanders. Programs like TEDCO (Technology Development Corporation), can be expanded and scaled to create incubators for small businesses. Ensuring affordable access to healthcare will increase entrepreneurs' ability to start a business without worrying about their family's health care. Increasing funding in public transportation and infrastructure will help businesses connect with a variety of markets more efficiently.","Ideally, the supreme court would call for a national system for establishing district maps. In the interim a state non-partisan, independent redistricting body would ensure the fairness of the redistricting process and would encourage elected officials to appeal to more moderate voters. There must be clearly set standards on how to determine representative fairness in a district and a transparent process that ensures accountability.","Fostering trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve is essential. The LEOBR is dependent on the police policing themselves and most departments have managed this effectively. However, we must remain cognizant of the mistakes made in Baltimore and remain vigilant that similar lapses do not happen elsewhere. Leadership in government and in the police departments must remain alert to how effectively the LEOBR is administered. Increased community outreach and transparency that does not impede the ability of law enforcement to do their jobs will help to create the relationships necessary to build that trust and must be a priority for all police departments in the state.","Opioid addiction is a national tragedy and a medical care emergency, requiring major changes in how we approach pain management. I support a comprehensive plan to combat the crisis that includes changes in our emergency response, addiction, rehabilitation and prescription policies. We can equip our first responders with Naloxone to counter the effects of opioid overdoses in the worst of situations. We can promote medication-assisted treatment for dependence and remove barriers in Medicaid to inpatient addiction treatment. We can improve the protocols of our medical system for managing chronic pain and utilize a state prescription monitoring system to identify potential problems in opioid use before it becomes a problem of addiction or overdose.","During the last several decades, income inequality in the United States has increased. Children born into low income families are born with similar abilities, however they have different educational opportunities. The resulting educational attainment gap between children born into low- and high-income families grows over time. In order to fight income inequality, state policies need to provide middle and low-income families better access to education and employment training that provide new skills in light of changes in technology. Additionally, we must acknowledge that income inequality has a magnified effect along gender and racial lines. Equal pay for women and the prevention of discriminatory compensation practices for people of certain races or ethnicities must be considered in combating this problem in Maryland.","A government that is truly of the people must be open to the people. State records and meetings must be accessible to all Marylanders. The basic mandate of the Public Information Act is to allow citizens to have access to government records without unnecessary cost or delay. The Attorney General requires that agencies and government officials have a clear process for handling record requests and that fees are reasonable. The existence of the Public Access Ombudsman who mediates disputes ensures an additional level of transparency. Open meetings laws aim to guarantee that public business is conducted openly and that citizens are allowed to observe their public officials, their deliberations, and the decisions that become public policy. One remaining area of concern is that technology now affords groups to ""meet"" and hold discussions without a physical presence. The use of email and virtual meetings must not take away the right of the public to observe our government at work.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

,YES,state-senate,7,Donna Hines,Hines,8/2/1955,Fallston,Democratic,Harford County,http://votefordonnahines.com,,,http://surveygizmoresponseuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/fileuploads/296249/4297291/99-f1c1c7afadf5035c32bf4b8a3a9f8dd6_Donna_Hines.jpg,"Although I was accepted to Wharton, I decided to study close to home for financial reasons. Later it proved to be fortuitous as it allowed me to take care of my dad when he got cancer. I graduated from Towson State University with two Majors: Business and Psychology. I also minored in Geography.","I worked my way through school by working part-time at The Savings Bank of Baltimore in the first ever walk- in-window in Maryland. I was trusted to work by myself, alone in a bank. As graduation drew near the bank officers attempted to recruit me into their management program. I was very dissatisfied that the path to management was different and longer for the women than the men. I chose to work for BG&E as they published their pay rates based on years of service for all of their jobs. They were a bit forward-looking and ahead of their time. I started in sales, then moved to customer relations where I met my husband. Later, I decided to learn about other departments in the company. I worked in Human Resources and then moved to Distribution Engineering. I was doing quite well, was promised a promotion, went on maternity leave and low and behold I lost my job while on pregnancy leave. BE&E eliminated my job but then filled the same position with a male employee. We went to court. I won the largest settlement in the state of Maryland - $750,000. The case was thrown out because the BG&E attorney was in the same elevator as a juror. The case had to be retried. Nothing that was allowed in the first trial was allowed in the second trial. I lost the case. The judge retired and his longtime law clerk got a job with BG&E immediately. I was a mom who volunteered at all of my daughter's school events. I served as an officer (vice president) on the PTA for ten years and was a regular on-site volunteer at my daughter's school every day for more than ten years. I also started several online businesses: Donna's Dally with Ruby Lane - vintage jewelry A vintage jewelry line with Etsy Sendalittlesomething - gifts under $150 My husband and I started an online site to assist people in recovery from heroin and opioid addiction called Quit The Habit or https://QuitTheHabit.org. I worked with Linda Williams from the Addictions Resource Council. She put me in touch with Joe Ryan from the Harford County Office of Drug Control Policy. They sent my husband and me to a five-day recovery coach academy training to help us hone the language on our site.","The Commission on Innovation and Excellence establishes new programs and makes funding recommendations for the following: Provide strong support systems for children and their families before students arrive at school Provide more resources for at-risk students than for others Develop world-class, highly coherent instructional systems Create clear gateways for students through the system, set to global standards, with no dead ends Assure an abundant supply of highly qualified teachers Redesign schools to be places in which teachers will be treated as professionals, with incentives and support to continuously improve their professional practice and the performance of their students Create an effective system of career and technical education and training Create a leadership development system that develops leaders at all levels to manage such systems effectively Institute a governance system that has the authority and legitimacy to develop coherent, powerful policies and is capable of implementing them at scale In addition, I think we must do all we can to increase the pay of our teachers, fund their pensions (so they do not have to) and provide them with the resources they need. I believe we must find additional avenues of revenue to fund our schools. I would advocate for the legalization of cannabis and use the majority of the tax revenue gained to support our teachers. Out teachers are hour heroes and they should be given the same professional respect and pay as similar professionals with equal education.","I would like to see Maryland expand their bus lines and provide more transportation across the counties. I would like to see expanded bus service to hospitals, places of worship, and educational centers like community colleges, technical schools, and colleges. I recently heard of some students in Edgewood Maryland taking 3 hours to get to Harford Community College and 3 hours to get home using our current transit system. We should find cost-effective means to provide this transportation. Can our school buses that sit unused most of the day be contracted to provide additional services at a reasonable rate?","Yes, I do and I would like to provide our farmers in Baltimore and Harford County and the rest of the counties in this state an opportunity to benefit from the growth of cannabis. In addition, I would like to allocate all tax monies gained from the sale of cannabis to go towards paying our teachers significantly more, funding their pensions and providing them with the resources they need. In addition, any money not going towards education should be allocated to our health care system.","The Chesapeake Bay is our most precious resource. It is the largest estuary in the United States. It is a true wonder of the world and it lies in our backyard. We must do everything we can to counter the regulations that the federal government is rolling back. The health of the Chesapeake Bay has improved over the past 5 years creating real potential for growth to the crab and oyster population. Our local seafood industry will thrive if these efforts are continued. We must keep clean water and clean air front and center on the agenda. Recent proposals by Trump along with many of his Republican leaders give the states rather than the EPA the ultimate decision-making authority over our national waters is a BAD IDEA. Under Trump, there are 67 environmental rules on the way out. Please see this article: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/10/05/climate/trump-environment-rules-reversed.html. I believe this is not a bipartisan issue and I will reach out to all legislators to identify which of the above rules have been rolled back and propose measures to counter the effects of this anti-EPA movement. Let save the bay. Let's save our Drinking Water. Let's protect our air.","I think this is such an important issue. I have been helped significantly by the Affordable Care Act. I believe the State of Maryland does an effective job of taking care of its citizens. Good health care should not be dependent upon your earnings and wealth. Everyone deserves good health care. Chris Rock, in one of his stand-up routines, said that if you are poor then you are sent home to die. If you have money, you can live a few more years. The mother of a coworker of my husband was sent home to die because she had cancer and she did not have health care. This was in a different state, but I do not want that to happen here. I am for universal health care. I am for doing whatever can be done to ensure the greatest number of Marylanders are insured. There are ways to take care of our citizens without increasing taxes. First, I would tax the pharmaceutical companies and take those proceeds to apply to our health care system. I would also fund health care with a portion of the revenue from the legalization of cannabis. I would also support the litigation being initiated to sue the pharmaceutical companies involved with opioid epidemic and use some of the proceeds to also fund our health care system.","I believe there should be close cooperation between our state police, our local police and Baltimore city police. I think we should have a task force, possibly as part of the State Police, to coordinate policing efforts and intelligence across the state. I believe a great deal of the crime in the city and the violence that surrounds it is a result of drug distribution. This task force would focus on curtailing the distribution of these drugs. I would support Mayor Pugh's recent programs to focus on specific drug areas. She has started a new program to provide support to certain high crime areas. Rather than focusing on just arresting criminals, she is bringing the Massachusetts-based ROCA program to the city. This program focuses on providing job training and job opportunities to at-risk youth aged 18 to 24 and has been very successful elsewhere. In addition, she has identified 4 areas as part of the transformation neighborhoods initiative where the city is beefing up resources to address high crime areas. In additon to policing they are focusing on trash removal, social services, job creation etc. I believe the state should assist the city in funding these programs.","I believe we need far more non-governmental jobs in Harford County. We have a wonderfully large area on our Route 40 corridor that is ripe for development and jobs. I would like to provide incentives and low-cost loans to promote small businesses in this area. In addition, I would like to utilize our technology resources from Harford Community College and elsewhere be used to assist new businesses in their expansion.",Yes. Our current maps do not make much sense. You have various districts like mine that cross from one county to another. I think it would make far more sense to base these districts within specific counties instead of spreading them across.,"I would like to establish a board that includes a number of citizens that review the actions and behavior of our police departments. Allowing only the mayor, or county executives to oversee police behavior does nothing to encourage the police to perform self-reflection and to address issues before they get out of hand.","I think that Harford County is doing a superb job of fighting the opioid epidemic. They are actively training recovery coaches, holding training seminars, conducting plays, sending their representatives to schools and are active in educating the community. I would follow the lead of Harford County. I would like to see more people who are trained in recovery, be required to provide some type of volunteer service to give back to the community. Most of the people who work in this field are just too emotionally drained to give more at the end of their day. So, I encourage training people outside of the field. What else can we do in the state of Maryland? Provide training to students (do not give this task to teachers) on how to cope with the terrible issues we face in life such as being ugly, called fat, stupid, etc. How to deal with rejection and life's ills. This is what causes people to turn to drugs. We must teach coping skills. This will help with addiction and violence. I am going to be self-serving here. My husband and I started Quit The Habit to provide recovery support to people in recovery from heroin and opioid addiction. I want this site to be the hub for people in recovery, anywhere in the nation to come and get and give support. We should train more recovery coaches and get them to my site to help the public. It is self-funded and free.","We should provide free community college. In addition, we should bring back vocational training in high school and we should also provide vocational education after high school. We should either add these classes to community colleges or set up new vocational schools. In addition, we should provide tax incentives for people in the trades to bring on paid interns to train them in their field. Additional incentives should be given to high-risk members of society who are trying to rebuild their lives.","No. There is inadequate coverage of the bills that are proposed and what is enacted in Annapolis and in our local jurisdictions. In the past, our local papers had sufficient resources to cover all state and local events. I would like to see the state and quite frankly our nation, provide funding to our most valuable resources - our national, state and local reporters. Their ranks have been diminished yet they, to a large degree, keep us informed and educated about the workings of our government. I believe we should find a way to fund our reporters and support our newspapers. This is critical to our democracy.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

Since 1998, The Tire Network has become an integral part of the revitalized section of Federal Hill where it is located, providing residents with a local small business that they can be proud of. I am a certified Maryland State Inspector and past volunteer fire fighter. I have advised various commissions and consultants on how to maximize transportation efficiency and ensure that the vehicles on our roads are safe, reliable and environmentally friendly. I am a defender of small business and in 2012, I took on the Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company for trademark infringement and won. I have acted as a political liaison –aid for the Finnish Foreign Affairs Committee, and as a past trustee of the Lansdowne Improvement Association, I worked hard to defeat the Maglev train proposal that would have torn apart neighborhoods in the train's path, and as chair of the CSX Abandoned Utility Pole Committee, I fought against sagging abandoned utility poles, scoring a major victory against CSX Transportation.","For decades, I have been an advocate for higher teacher salaries, additional spending on schools and school construction, the reimplementation of vo-tech programs across Maryland, and improved student safety, however these improvements require tremendous amounts of money. I have proposed an Immigrant Pay to Work program whereby all 350,000 undocumented workers in Maryland would be required to purchase an annual temporary right to work for $1000 and their employers would be required to purchase an annual blanket hiring permit. My plan will raise $350 million per year in permit sales alone, and millions more after income taxes. We should not have to unfairly bear the full burden of education costs, but we should allow undocumented workers who are willing to undergo a background check, provide a physical address and pay taxes to lawfully enter the workforce. Everyone should be paying their fair share when it comes to education, because nothing is more important than our kids.","The entire Baltimore region is in desperate need of transportation improvements. Let's improve our roads, safety laws and services with particular focus on: The elderly, Americans with disabilities and minorities. Transportation is a form of freedom and we should all have access to that freedom. As for financing improvements, we need to work toward additional revenue generation such as my immigrant pay to work program. We know what our needs are, and we know what needs to be done to address our failing roads, bridges and transit systems.","I do not have a particular problem with adults who choose to privately use Marijuana, but I am concerned with public use of ""pot"" including use while operating vehicles or equipment, and I have concerns about minor children who may be exposed to the drug while in the sanctity of their own homes. In my opinion, we should be promoting a drug free culture, we should be investing in education and promoting financial independence. I do, however, respect individual rights and freedoms and am commited to finding solutions to these problems.","We need to work toward compliance with the clean air act standards, it is simply unacceptable that Maryland is deemed a non-attainment zone. As a state senator, I will rewrite comar to address deficiencies in our transportation safety law as it applies to the environment, and I will work to find common sense solutions to protecting our most precious natural resource, the Chesapeake Bay.","Any meaningful solution to healthcare must include involvement from all of the stake holders which are; the doctors, the nurses, the insurance companies and the patients. We need complete, affordable, one stop coverage and care. We need to cut out corruption and abuses, and we need to put quality and affordability first.","The state can provide Baltimore with the additional financial resources needed to hire more police and probation officers. Currently, the Baltimore police department is under staffed and overwhelmed. We need to improve police morale, and we need tougher sentences for violent adult offenders. We need to show compassion for youth violators, and our stake holders need to know that they are appreciated. Let's put partisan politics aside and invest in doing the right thing.","The Maryland economy has tremendous potential, but we are suffering from a shortage of skilled labor. We need to reintroduced vocational programs at the high school level and we need to develop incentives for small businesses to hire. Additionally, I believe it is time for us to tax internet sales, it's not fair to force Maryland brick and mortar companies to compete against online companies that can sell products tax free.","Gerrymandering is, in my opinion, one of the most offensive practices in politics and all voters should be incensed at the mere mention of the word. Unfair redistricting has kept numerous highly qualified public servants from getting into office and improving the problems we all face, while it has allowed many unproductive politicians to stay in office and exploit their positions of power. I fully support the creation of a non-partisan body to create fair legislative and congressional districts.","I believe that the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights is adequate, and that recent changes have been made in the best interest of the public. As citizens we have every right to expect the highest level of professionalism from our police, and they deserve our respect and appreciation.","I propose more treatment and less punishment for users, and tough mandatory sentencing for drug dealers. ""If you offer illegal or regulated drugs for sale, then you go to jail."" ."" Additionally, we need better mental health services, and we need to invest in occupational training for recovering addicts.","For starters the state can stop using private contractors and temporary workers to fill state positions. If we need people in government, then let's hire them. Additionally, there should be limits on the amount of time that an employee must work in an entry level position, except in industries such as agriculture. And, we must pass laws that ensure fair compensation for everyone.","I believe that our current ""PIA"" gives the public adequate and timely access to records of all 3 branches, however we should consistently work toward greater transparency.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

These are fixed formulas that automatically dictate how tax dollars will be spent. Some of these formulas date back 75 years. There should be a review of all these formulas to ensure each jurisdiction is receiving its proper allotment of school funding.","About 10 years ago the counties and local jurisdictions had roughly 98% of their transportation funds cut. Due to these cuts, many of our roadways have not been properly maintained. Potholes, cracks and erosion are causing serious traffic issues. These funds need to be restored so that these failing roadways can be repaired. Additionally, new technology, such as 'smart' stop lights need to be installed to ensure traffic moves in a more efficient manner. The complete overhaul of the city's transportation system with BaltimoreLink has helped alleviate many of the area's public transit concerns, such as updating antiquated systems and routes, better access to alternate transit like the Light Rail and more efficient alignment with job networks.",No.,One of the biggest challenges facing the Chesapeake Bay is the hundreds of thousands of tons of sediment and pollutants sitting behind the Conowingo Dam. Another issue is the over-development of agricultural land and green space. This is taking away the natural filter that purifies the storm water before it makes its way to the Chesapeake Bay.,"The costs for individual insurer market is out of control. Rates have risen as much as 34% year after year. It has gotten to the point that many can't afford to have insurance. This is an issue that should be addressed on a federal level. However, with the feds not acting to fix it, legislation needs to be looked at next session to see what can be done at the State level to lower these prices.","We need to start addressing the issue of crime by using a three-prong approach of tackling short term, mid-range and long-range problems to achieve lasting results: 1) There needs to be a zero-tolerance policy for repeat violent offenders. Double the minimum sentence from five to ten years for repeat offenders who use firearms to commit felonies and violent crimes. 2) A large percentage of people are out of work because businesses do not want to hire people with non-violent, minor offenses. If we want our community to flourish, we need to rally around this segment of the population and give them the chance to get back to work. Mentorships and partnering with government programs that offer workforce training are two ways the business community can help make a difference. 3) Early teens who are at risk of getting involved in gangs and other violent criminal activity. This is another segment of the population that needs the help of citizens, businesses and community partners to mentor, tutor and offer other means of support to end the vicious cycle of violent crime in Baltimore. If we can intervene when they are still young, the long-term results could be incredibly beneficial for the city.","Over the past three years, Maryland has gained over 125,000 jobs and the unemployment rate has dropped to 3.8%, the lowest it has been in nearly a decade. The private sector is growing and Maryland continues to be a leader in key areas like Biotechnology, Information and Technology, and workforce educational attainment. To keep this momentum, Maryland needs to increase incentives and reduce regulations. For instance, last year the More Jobs for Marylanders Act was passed to incentivize and encourage manufacturers to create jobs where they were needed most, and to offer new and expanding manufacturing businesses a ten-year tax credit for each new job created. Two new tax credits under this plan are budgeted for FY 2019, and a new expanded proposal for 2018 will open the program to industries outside of manufacturing. This plan has the potential to create thousands of jobs and attract businesses by reducing state taxes for employers that offer opportunities in qualifying high-unemployment zones.",Yes. The process should be done in a non-partisan way that ensures politics is taken out of the process. Each district should be drawn in a way to ensure communities stay connected and not divided between multiple districts.,"Several years ago, the legislature changed the Law Enforcement Officer Bill of Rights and made it a more fair process.","Increasing penalties for dealers of heroin to include 2nd degree murder when someone they sell to dies as a result of an overdose. Additionally, Nalaxone and expanded medically assisted treatment services should be more readily available for people to access.","Public transit upgrades that provide better, more efficient access to high density job areas, incentivizing job growth in high unemployment zones and areas like manufacturing are a step in the right direction. Additionally, continuing to invest in public education, community colleges and workforce training initiatives that blend high school, college and workplace skills required for 21st-century jobs. These programs in particular can better prepare our students for the workforce and provide a steady pipeline of skilled professionals to some of the state's biggest employers.","I've always maintained that elected officials work for the people, not the other way around. I believe the more transparency in government the better, and think it's important for people to have a better understanding of bills that are under consideration in the House and Senate as well as the process the legislature follows during session. To that end, I fully support granting even more access to the public via television and live-screening technology.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

I do. I've seen the proposals to change the formula including increasing the base amount that is spent on each child from $6,900 to $10,800, offset by a decrease in the amount spent on most students versus those who need additional support. Under the current formula, LEA's get extra money for students living in poverty and who have special needs, as well as those who are new immigrants learning English. Under a new formula approach proposed, LEA's would get far less extra money for those students than they do now. This will be controversial but needs to be fully explored. To generate the requisite revenues for these (or any changes) I would support enhancements such as legalizing and taxing marijuana, closing corporate tax loopholes, Education trust fund gaming revenue (passed this session and going to referendum which I will strongly support).","No. There's an imbalance, weighted to roads. Yes. The State has the resources, but they're not being appropriated effectively. No. The Baltimore region is absolutely not being adequately served by transit. See for example the calamity that was the brief shut down of the only metro servicing the region a few weeks back. Supplemental bus service was able to be provided but that was far from ideal and not at all indicative of a long term solution for an area with some of the worst traffic congestion in the nation.","Yes. For fiscal (potential multi-billion dollar industry) and criminal justice equity reasons as these laws have had a grossly disproportional impact on minority and low income communities historically. Marijuana criminalization costs our state hundreds of millions of dollars every year without making us any safer. Legalizing, taxing, and regulating marijuana will provide Maryland with a dedicated revenue stream to make overdue and critical investments in other areas. I understand estimates to be upwards of $150 million dollars a year in projected revenue to state coffers and upwards of 18,000 jobs in a new industry.","The key is to be proactive. We should perhaps require the integration of coastal erosion, coastal storm, and sea-level rise response planning strategies into existing state and local policies and programs. Develop and implement state and local adaptation policies (i.e., protect, retreat, abandon) for vulnerable public and private sector infrastructure. Strengthen building codes and construction techniques for new infrastructure and buildings in vulnerable coastal areas. Because the agricultural sector is the largest source of pollution in the Bay and local waterways, and urban and suburban storm-water sources and rural septic systems also are pollution sources, we should buttress the multi-state, bipartisan partnership to restore the Bay, and promote policies or programs that address Bay pollution by reducing agricultural pollution, mitigating pollution from new development, reducing use of and pollution from septic systems, and/or improving storm-water management such as nutrient trading and the Watershed Protection and Restoration Act.","Shoring up the Affordable Care Act and protecting it against rollbacks from the current federal administration is a good place to start, until we can further explore something like a single payer program for the state. Now, I understand that the Department of Legislative Services has not conducted any recent studies of what it might cost to set up such a system in Maryland so this might be a good place to begin. I would also consider a state-run public option, under which the state would set up a health program to compete with private insurance rather than the state providing the coverage if that makes more sense fiscally.","The State should NOT be passing legislation that does anything to increase mandatory minimum sentences. Right now there's a severe crisis of basic confidence and trust from community to community, between communities and government, between communities and law enforcement. So that means we have to be very creative in any approach we pursue in this area. The DOJ consent decree reached last year will help address some of the trust issues, but until that plays out, one thing that should be considered is having police departments hold ongoing reconciliation meetings between police officers and community residents to discuss past incidents and air grievances or team up officers with community organizers to better understand neighborhoods thereby identifying violent offenders and potential victims along the way. An idea I've read about would involve the state funding a special training academy for the BPD's mid-level management and putting more resources into recruiting talent into the department. I understand in Baltimore, unlike most major city police departments, something as basic as the patrol cars not having on-board computers is still an issue…in 2018. That means City officers spend thousands of hours writing out reports that then have to be re-typed, with data errors and omissions every step of the way. As a member of the State Juvenile Justice and Grant Monitoring Council I know that there is work afoot already when it comes to youth violence, wherein we might expand the use of community mediation, community courts and diversion programs to reduce repeat offenses.","Overall developing. What I hear from small business owners in western Baltimore County is that there's a gap between the skill sets they need to grow their businesses and those that prospective employees possess. So supports on the educational side to boost technical skills via job training or apprenticeships may help. But also, there's an ongoing issue with what I call the incubation period for businesses (years 3 to 7 or so) when the euphoria of launching has faded and the hard task of building into something sustainable really takes hold. The irony is that better wages for workers (instead of being a detriment) might actually help as businesses will attract and retain (thus saving $) better personnel. The State should boost incentive programs to lure development in areas of need. Perhaps extending the time period for tax abatement that's afforded start ups a few more years. Assist with or give bonus/credits to companies that invest in training supports for workers, provide sick leave, or better wages. The public and private sector have to work together to realize that it's in everyone's best interest to have an economy that's thriving and people generally happier. Happier, respected, appreciated workers with more disposable income themselves produce more activity and great economic benefits for society overall which includes Maryland Businesses large and small.",Yes. Greater transparency is needed in the redistricting process generally. A redistricting commission comprised of average citizens independent of legislative or executive influence would lead to a better process and sounder outcomes more reasonably representative of the state's diversity. Having any redistricting plan presented as a bill and voted up or down would mean more public input and involvement via direct testimony which we should have in redistricting processes.,"Still not quite. HB1016 passed in 2016 was a good step in that it removed the requirement for notarization of a complaint against a law enforcement officer alleging excessive force and instead requires that a complaint be signed by a complainant under the penalty of perjury; allows a complaint to come from an individual with firsthand knowledge obtained because the individual has a video recording of the incident that, to the best of the individual's knowledge, is unaltered; and extended, from 90 days to 366 days, the complaint filing deadline triggering the requirement that disciplinary action be undertaken by a law enforcement agency. However, additional changes could include: completely eliminating the 10 day waiting period before an officer can be interrogated by a superior, including a prohibition against officers viewing written records by other officers that describe events in question, and requiring police departments to recruit and retain officers that reflect the makeup of the communities they are sworn to serve. Of course these are contentious (which is perhaps why they didn't make it into the 2016 bill), but the conversation should continue.","We have to start by recognizing this as a true public health crisis and avoid criminalizing people any further (this should apply and have applied to other areas and certain communities long before now, but I digress). Moving forward here, now, we should provide the overdose-reversal drug Naloxone to Baltimore and the 23 counties of the State at affordable prices by using the state's purchasing power to negotiate directly with pharmaceutical companies for the best prices. We should boost needle exchange programs to cut the spread of infectious diseases by addicts sharing syringes. Perhaps, we might expand diversion programs for people arrested for minor offenses into treatment programs, and work with the Attorney General's office in going after manufacturers of these prescription opioids whose products have led Marylanders into addiction and the use of cheaper, illegal drugs. Then use the proceeds of any settlements with those companies to create a dedicated fund to pay for the state's anti-addiction efforts. I believe this is happening or is at least underway in Prince George's County at the local level already.","I support a stronger minimum wage. Families cannot really live on the minimum wage which at 40 hours a week worked would still leave a worker too close to the federal poverty line. CityLab just released a report this week which indicates people need to earn $28/hour in Maryland to afford a 2 BR apartment without paying more than 30% of their income on housing. I support workers' rights to organize in the private and public sectors, so strengthening protections here would help. If the State were to move to close the corporate tax loopholes benefitting large businesses in Maryland, via combined reporting, the beneficiaries would be small businesses and lower wage workers. Roughly half the states in the nation already have some measure of combined reporting in place, including ""liberal"" enclaves such as Utah and Montana. Of the 15 states with corporate income taxes that had the best record in retaining manufacturing jobs in the last 10 years, 10 of them utilized combined reporting. Having combined reporting would benefit small businesses allowing to compete more effectively on a more level playing field and the revenues we would then have (estimated at $65 million per year by the Comptroller) could be put to use for small business tax credits or go to things such as enhanced child care subsidies for instance which would address inequality.","Probably more can be done in this regard. For instance, many legislative activities in Annapolis are not currently subject to recording or publication, so the transparency of governmental processes and machinations could stand a little more sunlight. However, we did just recently have changes put in place re: the MD Public Information Act (MPIA). I've not seen any evidence as to how well these are working yet. But working in an organization subject to many requests under this law I know that there has been increased awareness and responsiveness in this domain. I'd want to see how these changes are working (detailed or documented by the data) before calling for more changes just to being doing so.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

I look forward to the final recommendations at the end of this year. An adequate education is one of our few state Constitutional obligations, and I am committed to funding these final recommendations though I do not support raising taxes to do so. I think we need to look at all avenues as we move forward in funding Universal Pre-K and continuing education, and believe that we can find efficiencies in our school system to do so. In addition, I think we have an obligation to budget responsibly and make the tough decisions regarding how soon we can fully phase in the recommendations. Finally, we took an important step this year by finally passing a Constitutional Amendment to ensure that money from casinos go straight to adding to our education budget.","I don't believe that this is an either/or choice. Our roads are in a constant state of disrepair, from potholes to traffic on 695. Our mass transit does not adequately serve everybody who needs to get to work to make a living. We need to do a comprehensive look to see how we can ensure that the vast majority who use our roads have a safe drive, but that there is a path forward for those who use mass transit.","With Colorado, Washington, and other states legalizing marijuana, we must at least study the issue. We need to know the tax revenues, public health impacts, and other associated costs and benefits. Should we pass a bill to do so, I do believe it should go to the voters for their say, and I will push to pass legislation alongside it to make sure we are cracking down on anybody using these drugs while driving, and ensuring that our citizens remain safe.","Oysters and aquaculture are the magical ingredients to cleaning the bay. Oysters can filter over a gallon of water an hour, while also providing for a source of agricultural revenue. We also must look at more cover crops, and resources and incentives to help farmers reduce their pollution. We also must stand firm to protect the Bay. This session, I was proud to vote for Senate Bill 1128, which created severe penalties for any spills from offshore oil drilling. With the Federal Government considering oil drilling, we must take all steps possible to disincentivize this practice, and protect our precious Chesapeake Bay.","We must admit that our health care system is broken. Too many people are seeing their premiums hiked, with high deductibles, and little coverage. We took positive steps this session to stabilize the healthcare marketplace after the federal government destabilized it, but we must do more than simply stopping premiums from rising. We need to look at all sources of costs and look at all options. One approach that deserves closer scrutiny in the proposal from this past legislative session which will allow the individual mandate to become a downpayment on insurance costs - but even this is just a band-aid. Every year sitting on the Finance Committee I hear horror stories, and am looking forward to exploring all avenues to find a better, more permanent solution.","This past session, working with Governor Hogan we passed aggressive legislation to fight back against violent crime. Our approach to crime has been smarter against lower level offenses, but we must be tougher against the worst perpetrators who commit violent crime. We strengthened penalties against those who use guns multiple times for a violent crime, providing more tools to prosecutors, and we went after the worst of the worst. At the same time, we must continue to provide resources for more police officers so they can be on the street getting to work with their communities, and provide more job training opportunities for troubled communities.","For the last 50 years, I have watched my husband build a small business in our community, so I know better than most that life is tough for small business owners. We have taken positive steps to help small businesses - including the creation of a small business ombudsman - and we must do more. However, our business climate is not just determined by our small businesses. Every year during the legislative session, we look for opportunities to expand manufacturing. Last year, we worked with Governor Hogan to pass the More Jobs for Marylanders Act to provide incentives to manufacturers, and I have not given up hope that we can bring these jobs back to Maryland. In addition, for the last several years, I have worked with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to increase apprenticeships in our state. These vital resources will provide new paths to promising careers to young people entering the workplace. Finally, for all the talk of the importance of education, we need to remember to include continuing education. Not everybody needs to, or should go to college. From HVAC, to manufacturing, to working as a mechanic and more, there are plenty of expanded educational opportunities that can lead to better jobs without going to a four-year college. I will continue to promote this as an important option.",Yes.,"In 2016, the Legislature made an effort to rebalance LEOBR. We took input from police and the public and came up with a solution that neither side loved, but both accepted. This is the way legislating should work. Our police put their lives on the line for us every day, and deserve our thanks and appreciation - it's why I was a strong supporter of the Hometown Heroes Act, and why I continue to look for opportunities to show our thanks - while trying to keep that balance with the public.","I have been honored to lead the fight against the opioid epidemic in the Senate. Last year, we passed the HOPE bill which expanded crisis centers, created a crisis hotline, and provided for increased funding for treatment, and stabilization centers. In addition, we passed the Start Talking Maryland Act to ensure that parents and children start having conversations about avoiding these drugs. This year, we continued this leadership - passing legislation to crack down on pill mills, requiring prescribers to have conversations with their patients on the dangers of dependency, and requiring education before somebody can become licensed to dispense opioids. Ultimately, we need to work to prevent addiction from occurring - but also be prepared to treat it like the mental illness it is - not like a criminal justice issue. Finally, we must clamp down on those bringing Heroin and Fentanyl into our community. I have supported tougher sentences for the top level drug dealers, and will continue to work to make sure that those who bring these drugs into our community face harsh sentences.","I believe education is the great equalizer. We must continue to invest in our schools so every child has a chance to succeed. In addition, we must continue to invest in apprenticeships and other tools that can provide jobs and upward mobility for those who do not have access to these resources. Finally, we must realize that income inequality affects people of all ages, races, and gender. Job opportunities and pay equity for women are still a significant problem, and we must address those as part of a comprehensive solution.","While we have made great strides, we still have more work to be done. The people should have access to know what Legislators and elected officials are doing, and ofttimes the costs for transparency can be overly burdensome. I remain open to continuing to work to making government more accessible for more people.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

The draft report makes clear that there remains significant room for improvement in Maryland's K-12 system:  national assessments show that Maryland's educational system is average at best and large achievement gaps persist.  The approach needed to address these shortcomings is multifactorial and includes expanding early childhood education, elevating teaching as a profession, supporting students with disabilities, and ensuring that graduating students are prepared for their next career or academic endeavors.   I deeply believe that a world-class education is important for every child and that Maryland must step up to fund needed educational reforms.  My commitment is reflected in my voting record as a state legislator, where I have supported increased funding for early childhood education programs like Head Start, provisions for struggling or disabled students to access necessary resources, apprenticeship programs for students seeking a career in the trades, and an increase in funding for school construction and renovations.   I also recognize that these reforms are not inexpensive and will require the commitment of legislators in order to provide necessary funding.  It is with this responsibility in mind that I supported legislation in the 2018 session to address a $3 billion funding shortfall in the state's support for public schools.  With passage of SB1122, we've taken a substantial step forward in preparing for the Commission's final recommendations by requiring casino revenues be fully directed to public school education.","Transportation spending must be balanced between roads and mass transit.  Unfortunately, recent efforts have emphasized support for highway projects, at times diverting funds away from the densely populated central region of our state to more rural areas in Western Maryland and the Eastern Shore, while eliminating the Red Line and reducing funding for the Purple Line.   That is why I supported the passage of legislation requiring state transportation projects be scored based on established criteria.   Data from the Baltimore Metropolitan Council has shown that there are jobs available in the region, but residents in Baltimore cannot afford hours-long bus rides to reach a job outside of the city. The Red Line would have benefitted these communities while also serving as a needed economic driver for many struggling neighborhoods, and BaltimoreLink has not been an adequate replacement for its loss.   Additional support must also be provided to improve existing services like the Baltimore Metro and MARC.  It's inexcusable that Metro's maintenance has fallen so short as to require a sudden month-long system shutdown.  MARC improvements in reliability, train frequency, and adequacy in available parking—such as at the Halethorpe station—are also necessary. Maryland must spend its transportation dollars wisely in order to ensure that funding is available for transportation needs.  Thus, I disagreed with the popular decision to lower tolls for Maryland's bridges and tunnels that, in the end, will cost the state more and reduce available funds for the future infrastructure investments and transportation projects.","Marijuana is likely one of the most politicized drugs in our nation's history.  Policies adopted by the federal government decades ago have led to overcriminalization of marijuana use and stifled opportunities for better research and scientific understanding of this drug.  As a result, while marijuana use has climbed, our understanding of its benefits and potential harms is incomplete.   I fully support the legalization of medical marijuana because the available scientific evidence points to a clear medical benefit to patients.  I supported the state's implementation of a medical marijuana program and I've supported the 2018 legislative reforms to address shortcomings of the program that became clear over the past few years.   That being said, I have some reservations about the full legalization of recreational marijuana.  Other states that have rushed forward with legalization have experienced many challenges related to those policies.  As a result, I am cautious about supporting full legalization.  Some of my reservations stem from addressing health and safety concerns.  As mentioned above, I don't think we fully understand marijuana sufficiently to allow for widespread use, and the most common method of use—smoking—still carries the potential for harm.  Regardless, I do want to make clear that 1) I supported legislation that decriminalized the possession of marijuana and 2) that the generation of revenue for Maryland should not be the driving reason for legalization of marijuana.","The Chesapeake Bay is a Maryland treasure whose watershed supports the livelihood of millions of people and countless species of animals who depend on a healthy and clean bay.   To protect the health of the Chesapeake Bay, Maryland needs to stay committed to the EPA established Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) limits for nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment.  Recent data shows that the state is on target in addressing phosphorus and sediment runoff but continues to miss its goals in reducing nitrogen effluent into the bay.  To address this, the state must advance policies aimed at: reducing agricultural runoff; implementing conservation measures on farms including fencing animals out of streams and maintaining grassed or forested buffer strips along farm fields; reducing the use of chicken litter in agricultural fields, and revegetating natural filters such as forests, oysters, wetlands, and underwater grasses. The state must also address shortcomings in sewer and septic systems by connecting septic systems to already available upgraded treatment plants when feasible, expanding availability of nitrogen removal technologies for upgrading of septic systems, and requiring the reasonable use of nitrogen removal technology on new systems.  The Chesapeake Bay has never been healthier, but this progress has only been possible through concerted action and support for vital federal and state programs.  With the continued threat of reduction of federal funds for important bay programs, I would support an increase in state funds to ensure important programs are able to continue and the progress we've made in the bay is sustained.","As a physician, I consider healthcare a fundamental human right that should be available to everyone, not a privilege only for those who can afford it.  As such, I believe Maryland must continue to strive towards universal healthcare for all.  Although the federal government is best empowered to establish a uniform single-payer system across the country, I support and will continue to advocate for state policies that will advance Maryland towards universal coverage and a single payer-type system. Maryland has made great advances through the Affordable Care Act by enrolling over 300,000 individuals in health coverage.  But more must be done to improve affordability to continue to move towards universal coverage.  That is why I sponsored legislation (HB1504) during the 2018 session to examine the establishment of a reinsurance program to mitigate insurance premium increases stemming from a few patients that require a catastrophic level of care.  I also sponsored legislation (HB1038) that would have made it easier for pregnant women to enroll in healthcare by requiring insurers to consider pregnancy as a ""qualifying life event,"" which currently they do not.  I've also co-sponsored legislation that will reduce health insurance premiums, support improvements to the health exchange, and encourage more companies to participate in the exchange in an effort to increase competition and reduce rates.   I hope to continue working on important legislation that will explore the expansion of eligibility for Medicaid to any Marylander, extend open enrollment periods, and help mitigate the loss of federal cost-sharing subsidies.","A safe, thriving, and prosperous Baltimore is crucial to the success of the State of Maryland, and so we must step up to play a vital role in helping Baltimore address violent crime.  However, we must bear in mind that violent crime is an end result of many different systemic failures including poverty, inadequate education, insufficient jobs and productive opportunities, poor support network of family or friends, availability of illegal drugs and weapons, and many other reasons.  Addressing the problem of violent crime cannot only be restricted to criminal justice solutions but must also address these other social determinants that are especially large and challenging.   These problems are too large for one jurisdiction, and their solutions span across the state, which is why the state must step up to assist Baltimore.  To address this, the state needs to provide funding for schools and educators to improve Baltimore's public education system, support businesses that create local jobs and provide needed benefits like child care subsidies and credits to workers, implement policies that promote integration of housing and combat ""redlining"" which keeps neighborhoods in poverty, support expansion of mass transit options so workers without cars can get to jobs without spending hours on a bus, support workforce training and apprenticeship programs, address drug addiction, promote justice reinvestment and decriminalization policies to break the cycle of crime, reduce the availability of weapons and firearms, and fund programs like Baltimore's Safe Streets that take a proven, public health approach to reducing violence.","Maryland businesses are successful in an environment that is competitive and fair.  A study by Ernst & Young found that Maryland businesses pay well below the national average in taxes and rank second lowest in the nation in the share of taxes paid to state and local governments.  Entrepreneurship remains high, with Maryland ranking consistently as a top state in the nation for innovation by small businesses and start-up companies.   Despite these achievements, Maryland should continue to make improvements in supporting well-paying jobs.  Despite having the highest median household income in the country, nearly 10% of Marylanders live in poverty, and so ensuring family-supporting jobs must be a priority.   I support the following measures to help workers, reduce inequality, and support families:  expand affordable child care to working families through tax credits, subsidies, or other programs to make it easier for parents to work; establish universal early childhood education because it will allow parents to go back to work sooner and has been shown to have a lasting positive impact on a child's development; legislation that will ensure equal pay for equal work so that women are not underpaid for doing the same work as their male counterparts; prohibiting employers from asking applicants for their prior work history to reduce salary disparities; improving mass transit options and public infrastructure so that parents spend less time commuting and more time with families; and expanding workforce training programs so that parents seeking to reenter the job market are equipped to do so.","I am concerned about the level of partisanship involved in the drawing of district maps.  The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule on this specific issue shortly, and I hope that the ruling removes partisanship as a factor that can continue to be used in the redistricting process.  This issue is best addressed at the federal level so that uniform standards can be applied in all districts across the country.   Nonetheless, the state can and should take action on this issue.  In the past, I have supported legislation that would trigger these reforms to our redistricting process if other neighboring states also adopted similar policies.  I will continue to support legislation that allows for a non-partisan, independent body to lead the state's redistricting efforts after each census.   For nearly 10 years, California has had a redistricting commission comprised of citizen commissioners that I believe has been fairly successful in creating reasonable district maps.  California's redistricting process could serve as a model for Maryland in allowing for fairer and more competitive elections.  Other policies that could be adopted to support more competitive elections include California's ""top two"" primary system (where the top two candidates in a primary advance to the general election, regardless of party affiliation) and expanded public financing of campaigns so that the ability to fundraise is not a hindrance to serving the public.","The Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights (LEOBOR) was enacted by the legislature over 30 years ago to provide protections to a law enforcement officer facing potential disciplinary action during an investigation of that officer's conduct by a law enforcement agency.  I have some ongoing concerns about the LEOBOR, and I believe that some additional reforms to the LEOBOR are needed.   In instances where a LEOBOR hearing board is formed to investigate claims of misconduct, the hearing board is important in maintaining the public's trust and sense of legitimacy in investigating allegations.  As a result, I believe the composition of the members of the hearing board are critical to advancing the legitimacy of the hearing board process.  I support legislation that will ensure greater public representation and improve the transparency of the LEOBOR hearing board because I believe the exclusion of civilian voices and oversight deepens the mistrust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.  I am also in favor of reforming the hearing board process so that police chiefs have greater flexibility in addressing shortcomings in procedure and obvious misconduct without being constrained by the decision of the hearing's board decision.  Ultimately, the police chief is accountable for the actions of his or her officers and must take appropriate disciplinary steps when appropriate.  Overall, these reasonable reforms to the LEOBOR would greatly improve public trust in law enforcement and increase accountability and oversight of the officers serving our communities.","The opioid addiction and overdose crisis is a significant public health concern for Maryland.  The problem of opioid addiction is complex, and so it requires a tiered approach that focuses on prevention and treatment.  The state legislature has taken steps over the last few years to address the problem, including permitting standing orders for naloxone, passing ""Good Samaritan"" laws protecting those who report overdoses, and allowing pharmacists to dispense naloxone.  However, rates of addiction, overdose, and death from opioids continues to climb in Maryland.  As a public health physician, I believe we need to continue to be aggressive in tackling this crisis.  In preventing further cases of addiction, healthcare providers play a key role in reducing the use of opioids by restricting prescriptions to those that are absolutely necessary, being more familiar with other pain management alternative to opioids, and ensuring tight compliance with the state's Prescription Drug Monitoring Program.  This may also require greater oversight of over-prescribers by the Board of Physicians.  For those who are addicted to opioids, safe consumption sites where users are monitored by healthcare providers, distribution of spot testing kits for fentanyl, expanded and inexpensive distribution of naloxone, and a greater availability of medical assisted therapy like buprenorphine could help reduce detrimental outcomes.  As a legislator, I've also supported increased funding for treatment beds, intervention programs, and reimbursements to providers because it is critical that users who are ready to seek treatment must not endure long waits.","Income inequality is at some of the highest levels in our nation's history, and so Maryland must continue to strive towards reducing income inequality.  As a policymaker, I am concerned about the growing gap between the rich and the poor.  This level of inequality is not sustainable in the long term, diminishes opportunities for many workers who are struggling, and tears at the fabric of our society by reducing the likelihood that someone who works hard can achieve the American Dream.   It is concerning to me as a legislator that nearly 10% of Marylanders continue to live in poverty while the state ranks highest in median household income.  For that reason, I believe that policies that are adopted by the legislature must be scrutinized to ensure that they are progressive, rather than regressive.  Tax credits and subsidies to big businesses and special interests should be withheld unless they serve to reduce income inequality of the average worker.   I support the expansion of the state's earned income tax credit as a means to support low and moderate-income working families.  I also favor increases to the minimum wage as a means to reduce disparities and would support indexing the minimum wage to increases in the cost of living.  Finally, I think we should continue to level the playing field by providing opportunities for working families to achieve the American Dream through programs that expand availability and accessibility to child care for parents and paid parental leave.","The state adopted legislation several years ago that improved and strengthen the provisions of the Public Information Act (PIA).  This legislation provided a means to address citizen complaints by creating a Maryland PIA Compliance Board, adjudicates allegations of unreasonable fees of greater than $350 for the production of requested documents, and established an ombudsman that helps mediate disputes between requesters and records custodians.   I believe all of these provisions are good steps forward in advancing the goals of the PIA, but the legislature must remain watchful in ensuring that the public has the tools necessary to exercise oversight of our government.  Access to government information is a basic right of the public by a government who works for them, and so the PIA is a critical tool in facilitating an informed public and press so that our government remains accountable and transparent.   When seeking information, the records custodians in state and local agencies have a significant amount of authority in determining which records can be made available.  The public, in seeking access to this information but also unaware of the information that is available, is at an inherent disadvantage when seeking documents.  For that reason, it is incumbent on the legislature to periodically assess whether the balance between the authority of the records custodians and needs of the public are adequately balanced.  The PIA Compliance Board will issue periodic recommendations for amendments of the Act, and I would certainly be open to considering their future proposals.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

Laskin,Laskin,3/3/1951,Baltimore,Democratic,Baltimore County,http://www.sheldonlaskin.com/,SheldonHLaskin,SheldonHLaskin,http://surveygizmoresponseuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/fileuploads/296249/4297291/95-e5eaf31a478bb204de72061ab6f1301c_Head_shot.png,"BA, JD Rutgers University.  LL.M in Taxation, University of Baltimore","I am a retired attorney.  I represented migrant and seasonal farmworkers, litigated employment discrimination cases (including winning a unanimous decision from the US Supreme Court), was a Maryland Assistant Attorney General and was counsel to the Multistate Tax Commission where I worked on state tax policy issues at the national level.","Yes, I do support the findings of he Kerwin Commission.  Maryland students deserve a quality, 21st century education without regard to where they live, their race or their socioeconomic status.  Providing such an education requires full funding to meet every student's needs.  I also support funding to hire and train qualified teacher aides to take some of the classroom load off of teachers.  Vocational education needs to be greatly expanded.  Maryland needs skilled workers such as  plumbers, electricians, HVAC specialists and home health care workers.   The public schools should offer adequate opportunities for students to master those skills.  Finally, all schools need to have modern, efficient heating and air conditioning systems.  Antiquated schools need to be replaced, with prioritization  based on need and not on how politically influential a  neighborhood might be.","Maryland's transportation system is totally unbalanced.  Building more roads to relieve congestion is a fool's errand.  More roads only increases congestion; if you build it they will come.   The cancellation of the Red Line was a mistake that needs to be rectified.  Clean and efficient mass transit must take priority in state funding over road construction.  The resources for mass transit and other critical needs can be found by reducing our overreliance on prisons to address violent crime.  Spending on prisons only produces more prisons, not less crime.  By concentrating on proven - and cheaper - alternatives to incarceration, we can free up resources for transportation and other urgent social needs.","Yes.  Marijuana is far less harmful than alcohol or tobacco, both of which are legal. Dealing marijuana is often the gateway to a career in the criminal drug trade.  That in turn leads to overpolicing and mass incarceration, both of which drain public resources away from vital social needs such as education and transportation.  Legalizing marijuana ends that gateway to crime and creates  massive additional tax revenue to meet those important public purposes.  In the first three years after  Colorado legalized recreational marijuana, the state received half a billion dollars in increased tax revenue.  Maryland's population is 700,000  higher than Colorado's and can expect to receive even more  tax revenue to meet its citizens critical public needs.","One of the biggest steps Maryland can take to protect the Bay is to curb concentrated animal feeding (CAFO) agriculture on the Eastern Shore.  Industrial scale farming produces massive amounts of manure and other wastes that leech into the soil and ultimately find their way to the Bay.  The amount of urine and feces produced by the smallest CAFO is equivalent to the quantity of urine and feces produced by 16,000 humans. CAFO waste is usually not treated to reduce disease-causing pathogens, nor to remove chemicals, pharmaceuticals, heavy metals, or other pollutants. Over 168 gases are emitted from CAFO waste, including hazardous chemicals such as ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and methane.  Methane is one of the leading contributors to climate change.  Curbing CAFOs is essential to preserving the Bay.  In addition, Maryland should continue to increase  its renewable energy standards.   Reducing fossil fuels is essential both to address climate change and to reduce pollution in the Chesapeake watershed.","Maryland should move to implement a single payer health care system.  Health care will never be affordable as long as it is financed through private insurance companies.  Those companies owe a fiduciary duty to their shareholders to maximize profit, not to provide affordable, quality health care.  Every other leading Western democracy provides health care through some form of single payer system.   Health outcomes are better than in the United States, at lower cost and with a higher level of consumer satisfaction.  Here in the US, Medicare recipients consistently report overall satisfaction with Medicare's single payer system.   The Rand Corporation estimates that Oregon can afford to implement a single payer system.  Maryland's population is 2,000,000  higher than Oregon's.  Surely, if Oregon can afford to implement single payer, so can Maryland.","We cannot incarcerate our way out of violent crime.  We've tried that repeatedly in recent decades, only to wind up with the mass incarceration of generations of African American males, to decimating effects in inner city neighborhoods.  Alternatives to incarceration -- drug addiction counseling and  treatment, quality education, job training and jobs -- in conjunction with peer to peer crisis intervention programs such as Safe Streets, have been empirically shown to reduce violent crime.  Particularly following the revelations of police corruption in the Gun Trace Task Force case, now is not the time for Maryland to adopt a crime bill that can only increase overpolicing and mass incarceration in Baltimore.    We need to stay focused on the root causes of crime, not the violent symptoms of that problem.","It is inaccurate to speak of Maryland's ""business climate"" as if all businesses are uniformly affected by state economic and fiscal policies. In fact  in Maryland, as in all states, some businesses do better and some do worse, depending on a host of factors including their product and customer mix, the availablity of a quality workforce, decent schools and roads and taxes.  As to taxes especially, not all businesses are equal.  Maryland's corporate tax rate is about in the middle of its neighboring states.  In addition, many Maryland businesse have a relatively low tax burden, because Maryland has no gross receipts tax on manufacturers, no corporate franchise tax, no unitary tax on profits, no income tax on foreign dividends (if the corporation owns 50% or more of the subsidiary), no tax on intangible property and no separate school taxes (many states impose such taxes).  The best ways for a state to foster family-supporting jobs is to provide quality education, a wide mix of cultural amenities, good roads, a good health care system and thriving communities in which to live.  That is how states and localities attract young professional families who in turn provide the tax base for further job growth.","Gerrymandering is a bipartisan disgrace.  It is a cliche, but true, that voters do not choose their representatives -- the representatives choose their voters.  I was redistricted myself after the 2010 census.  Redistricting must be done by a non-partisan, independent body.  Partisan legislators cannot be counted on to  draw the legislative and congressional maps in a disinterested manner.  We waste too much time and money on these decennial battles over increasingly absurd district lines.  It's time to take this task out of the hands of the very legislators who are drawing the maps that will determine whether they will be reelected.","No, it does not.  Law Officers have a bill of rights already -- the same one all Americans have.  The police are to serve and protect the citizens.  Therefore , they must always answer  to those citizens.  In any instance of alleged police misconduct, the review process must include meaningful citizen input and transparency, to assure that the public will trust the outcome of the investigation.  As the Freddie Gray trials showed, the criminal courts are perfectly capable of protecting the criminal rights of accused police officers without additional protections that are unavailable to the average citizen.  In the end, the police work for the citizens and need to be held  accountable to the citizens.","First and foremost, health care practitioners must be educated to dramatically reduce the amount of opiods they prescribe.  In many cases, there are safer alternative pain medications.  I had a wisdom tooth pulled a few years ago, and the dental surgeon prescribed oxycontin.  I ignored the prescription, took one or two Tylenol, and was fine.  The prescription never should have been written to begin with.   This crisis was entirely preventable.  Pain is sometimes an unavoidable consequence of  medical treatment.  Patients accepted that before pharmaceutical companies started pushing opiods to boost profits.  As a society, we need to commit resources to  educate both patients and health care providers that the dangers of these medications  in many cases far outweigh any benefit.","First, a $15 per hour  minimum wage is essential.  It is no longer the case that minimum wage workers are teenagers working part-time during the school year.  Many single mothers are the sole source of support for their families, and work full-time at minimum wage jobs to provide that support.  Fifteen an hour isn't luxurious -- it's only $600 per week if the worker works 40 hours per week.  Furthermore, if we're serious about reducing violent crime, we need to discourage entry level drug dealers from entering the business.  Six hundred a week may not be equal to what a dealer can make hustling drugs on the street.  But weighed against the virtual certainty that that entry level dealer will either be dead or in prison in 10 years, it could well be enough to discourage him from taking that route to begin with.  After $15 per hour, we need to implement a true living wage that will allow workers to adequately support their families while allowing sufficient quality time with family members -- to read to a child, to play, to go to school conferences and to engage in  all those other activities  that make life meaningful.  And finally, we need to reinstate a truly progressive taxation system whereby the very wealthy pay a bit more to fund programs  to build up those at the other end of the income ladder.","No.  There are too many exceptions and exclusions.  Government needs to be as completely transparent and open as possible.  If public safety or individual confidentiality are not an issue, the meeting should be opened.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education? Are you committed to funding associated reforms, and if so, how?","Is Maryland’s transportation spending appropriately balanced between roads and transit?

Towson University, B.S. Political Science","I have spent my career as an attorney representing low-income individuals in Baltimore. For the past six years, I have represented individuals who were lead-poisoned as children in trial and appellate courts. Previously, I served as an Assistant Public Defender in Baltimore in both juvenile and adult courts. My final year at the Office of the Public Defender was spent in Annapolis working with its Government Relations team. Prior to my legal career, I worked as a Youth Development Professional with the Boys and Girls Clubs.  In addition to practicing law, I also serve as adjunct faculty at the Community College of Baltimore County. I began teaching remedial courses in the Math Department, then transitioned to the Legal Studies Department","Yes. As someone who has taught remedial math courses at CCBC and who has represented cognitively disabled and impoverished children as an attorney, I know first-hand the inequities of our public education system. We don't currently know what the final cost is for the associated reforms, but we can assume it will be a hefty bill. Many of the Kirwan Commission recommendations can be achieved without increased funding. However, the most important recommendations need to be funded. I support the ballot question to create an education lockbox for Maryland's casino revenue and I also support Governor Hogan and the Maryland legislature's plan to use our windfall tax revenue caused by federal tax reform for our schools. Furthermore, new revenue should be considered such as legalized marijuana. Nine states (two this year with Republican governors) and the District of Columbia have legalized recreational marijuana and have reaped the tax rewards. Washington State saw $1.3 billion in sales and Colorado is continuing to see increased tax revenue that is funding their schools. I'm more than happy to lead this effort in the Maryland State Senate.","Most drivers probably underestimated the benefit of our subway until it was closed for a month. The added buses, Ubers, and cars on our road backed up I-83 enough to cause a few headaches and miserable commutes. We all benefit from a world-class public transportation system and Baltimore is far from that. We do not have an appropriate balance between roads and transit spending. I am encouraged by legislation that was passed this year to add funding to WMATA and MTA. Somehow we need to revive the Red Line and have a larger conversation about regionalism. Baltimore County Executive Kevin Kamenetz originally balked at our county paying its fair share for the Red Line. All of Baltimore City's neighbors need to chip in because we all benefit from less congestion and providing opportunities for low-income individuals to get to jobs and school.","Absolutely. See above answer about education funding. Also, when I was at the Office of the Public Defender, I was a leading and successful advocate for marijuana decriminalization. There are too many reasons that this should become law. States that have better marijuana laws have fewer opioid deaths; our current medical marijuana program has been a joke; racial disparities in drug enforcement have a devastating effect on low-income communities, etc…","In 2014, The Baltimore Sun's editorial board gave me credit for having the courage to stand up for the stormwater management fee. We saw the devastation recently in Ellicott City which showed the need for flood planning and the dangers of development in high-risk areas. On a regular basis, rain carries pollution down impervious surfaces. Our stormwater management program if implemented well can protect the Bay from soil erosion and poultry farms. Hopefully, in 2018, we can elect an administration who won't roll back environmental policies, like Hogan did with septic pollution. I would also encourage incentives for groups like Gunpowder Valley Conservancy to help homeowners install rain barrels, and eliminate use of lawn fertilizers. Furthermore, limiting development while promoting common-sense regulations for stormwater runoff will help our Bay. The Innovative Technology Fund is a great program that should be fully funded. I also support any oyster restoration program.","This legislative session, Maryland stepped up to lead the nation by protecting our marketplace in the wake of the dismantling of Obamacare. I support the legislature's decision for an individual mandate and tax on insurance companies. I am also intrigued by Ben Jealous' plan for a Medicare-for-All system. I am a believer that universal healthcare should be our goal.",This is a problem that will not be fixed with mandatory minimums or increased sentences. That is a failed policy and will solve nothing. I am at least grateful that the state will increase its funding for community-based programs like Safe Streets. Rethinking our war on drugs and focusing on rebuilding Baltimore's school system and economy will have a greater effect on crime than any sentencing proposal. Of course we need to also focus on short-term crime fighting. More community policing and patrols in high crime areas should be the focus.,"Maryland, like most of the country, has done well coming out of the Great Recession and now has an unemployment rate hovering around 4%. I think everyone in Annapolis will call that a success. At the time that the unemployment rate was declining, Maryland's minimum wage was incrementally increasing. I support its continued increase and will fight for a new bill to index the minimum wage to inflation. To make Maryland a place that a business like Amazon would want to call home requires our state to be forward thinking on all of the questions in this survey. Not just an enormous tax package.","Yes. Hopefully, the Supreme Court addresses gerrymandering in Maryland, Wisconsin, and North Carolina all at once and sets a national standard. For now, I am okay with acting first. Yes, Maryland might lose a Democrat-held Congressional seat (probably not in an election year like 2018), but it's the right thing to do.",The Board needs to be modified to include civilians. Faith in the Baltimore City Police Department is at an all-time low following the Gun Task Force scandal and Freddie Gray before that. And it doesn't seem to matter who the police commissioner is. Maybe the citizens of Baltimore will feel more comfortable knowing that the police won't be the only ones policing themselves.,Continue to go after pharmaceutical companies and doctors who over-prescribe. Legalized marijuana will help at lowering the use of opioids by providing an alternative for pain relief and other medical reasons. I support additional funding for treatment and less incarceration.,"See above regarding minimum wage. Also, if we are successful following the Kirwan Commission recommendations and create equitable schools, then we might be able to create economic mobility. Housing needs to be addressed so that we are not concentrating poverty. It is easier to climb up the ladder when you have resources in your community.  I follow the research of Raj Chetty closely and would like to work to evidence-based solutions.","I'm not aware of serious problems in this area, but I would be interested to learn more.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

I have worked on energy efficiency, renewable energy, and environmental issues for 20 years.","Yes, I support the Commission's findings. We must fund education adequately and those funds need to be distributed equitably and fairly among the different school districts. Securing additional funding should be done by ensuring that gambling revenues are in addition to other school funding. We also need to ensure that school funding is used wisely by tracking how much funding in each school district goes to classrooms and how much goes to administration. We should also pursue truly innovative ideas from high-achieving school systems; many such innovations are either no-cost or low-cost solutions.","I believe that up to this point the state's transportation spending has been fairly well balanced. Since most Marylanders travel by car, we must continue to maintain and improve our road infrastructure. However, we also need to make significant investments in public transportation. We simply cannot solve our transportation challenges by solely focusing on roads. If additional funding is needed, I would support a slight increase in gasoline tax or some type of carbon pricing to fund needed road and transit projects. Since I don't live in the Baltimore area, I cannot properly assess the adequacy of the available transit options in the area.",Yes. We should not waste our public safety resources on unnecessary law enforcement and imprisoning people for recreational marijuana use. Legalizing marijuana would also provide us with additional tax revenue to help us fund priority projects and programs.,Protecting the Chesapeake Bay must be a high priority for Maryland. The state can protect the Bay by preserving natural landscapes and creating more protected buffers in critical areas. I will champion land preservation policies and programs to enable the establishment of such protective land areas and buffers.,"We must have affordable health care and it needs to be available to everyone. Since the federal government is not making progress on this front, Maryland should work to create a statewide universal health care program. As an interim step to achieve this, a ""public option"" plan could be built by creating a health insurance system for state and other public sector employees.","Since I don't live in the Baltimore area, I cannot claim to have intimate knowledge about all the underlying issues and challenges related to violent crime in the city. As a general approach, I believe we must find a way to bridge the divide between the police and the residents they serve to protect. One proven approach to achieve this is through community policing, and I believe we must support and strengthen such programs. Addressing larger societal ills, such as poverty, lack of educational opportunities and the opioid crisis, is also paramount.","Maryland has many qualities that make it a good place to conduct business, such as a well-educated and diverse workforce, thriving metropolitan areas, advantageous location, and rich natural resources. However, in many cases we have too many regulations and unnecessary bureaucracy that is not conducive to business and job creation. We should work to identify areas where regulatory reform is desirable and needed. An example is our antiquated liquor laws that are hampering the growth of craft breweries. We need to reform our laws to foster the growth of this dynamic new industry.","Yes, I strongly support establishing a neutral, nonpartisan system for drawing congressional and legislative districts. I have advocated for such redistricting reform in Maryland for several years. This would be one of my top legislative priorities.","I understand the difficult circumstances in which police officers work and their absolute right to a fair process to handle any complaints made against them. However, we have seen that in practice the current process is too protective of law enforcement officers and makes it nearly impossible to hold police officers responsible for gross misconduct. I believe the law should be changed so that the process for handling accusations against police officers is conducted by an independent third party. In the end, I believe it is also in the law enforcement officers' own best interest if ""bad apple"" individuals are held accountable for their actions.","The opioid addiction crisis is a complicated, multi-faceted problem, and we need to work on multiple fronts to find solutions. We need to educate our physicians about alternative pain treatment methods and strive to significantly reduce the number of opioid prescriptions. Reducing the number of prescriptions should result in a drop in the number of new addicts. We also must make further investments in treatment programs to help those who are struggling with addiction. We also need to address larger societal ills, such as poverty, lack of educational opportunities, and unstable communities.","Income inequality is a major issue in today's society that must be addressed. To help people on the lowest economic ladder, we must increase the state's minimum wage and tie it to a cost of living index. We must also work to develop an affordable, universal health care system. Providing affordable health care for all will be particularly helpful for low-income residents who can face extreme financial hardship due to a minor illness. We also need to further invest in educational programs and opportunities for all students and residents, with particular focus on vocational opportunities. This will open pathways for economic security for more residents.","Maryland has made improvements to laws regarding public information and open meetings. As we encounter new problems and find additional loopholes, such issues need to be fixed. At this time, I believe the undemocratic nature of the power structure in the General Assembly is the most significant obstacle to residents' ability to exercise oversight of the government. Currently, the Senate President and House Speaker have too much power over the legislative process. These individuals can block action on any legislation without any explanation and accountability. If elected, I will push for more democratic power structures in the General Assembly. We must also ensure that the same individuals don't wield this significant power decade after decade.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

I've always advocated for the increased use of mass transit, and seeking efficient usage of all modes of transportation.","I look forward to addressing this issue as it comes up in the legislature, and I will continue to support medical marijuana in our state, particularly in stabilizing and growing it.  This past session, I voted for the granting of additional medical marijuana licenses for the purposes of gender and ethnic balance within that new industry.    As the debate over recreational marijuana continues, I look forward to hearing from both sides of the issue.  I will keep an open mind on a statewide referendum on the issue, so that the  people of Maryland may decide for themselves.","My record of public service in local government as an Ocean City council member and mayor, and in the state house and senate, reflect strong action in protecting the Chesapeake and Atlantic coastal bays' health and future. This year I sponsored legislation to hold oil companies strictly liable for any damages they may cause in the event of an oil spill, as well as legislation calling on the federal government not to allow the coast off of Maryland to be used for drilling.    Given lessons learn from the development boom of the early 2000's, as well as the strong, respected, and effective dialogue I've established with the agricultural, commercial watermen industries, and other stakeholders.  I believe establishing effective policy is vital in protecting the legacy of our state and the Eastern Shore, I believe policy to protect our bays (and the industries that depend on them) is an achievable goal.  With regard to the public financing  to protect our priceless waterways, I will continue to strongly urge all members of our federal delegation to make certain that the Executive and Legislative Branches of our government, their budgeting and policy matters maintain their partnership role in protecting the national treasure that is the Chesapeake watershed area.","I've worked with Governor Hogan and our partners in healthcare to stabilize Maryland's healthcare market and stop rising rates this year. In prior session, I passed legislation to expand access to telemedicine, and I continue to support medicare expansion.  I also proudly co-sponsored the Rural Health Collaborative Pilot program.   While it is important to expand access to healthcare to ensure a healthier Maryland, I am committed to not raising taxes.","I was born in Baltimore, it pains me everyday to see the crime not improve at the rate it should be in my hometown.  The State of Maryland should continue to assist the City of Baltimore with resources to ensure that the people of Charm City have the access they need to the funding, quality schools, job opportunities, and redevelopment they need to reduce crime to demonstrate that Maryland is a full partner to Baltimore, as well to all areas rural and urban of our state in need of the full resources to reduce high crime rates.","Our business climate is good, but it still has room for improvement.  My family & I came to Ocean City to start a small vending machine business, which we still operate over 40 years later.  As one who been a small business owner nearly all of my adult life, I know the struggles of small business owner in Maryland, and I hear from other small business owners across the Lower Eastern Shore and the state everyday.  That's why I strive to advocate for small and medium business, including by reducing their tax burden and incentivizing them to create jobs in the jobs deserts that exist in our state.    I've continued to be a part of improving our business climate by supporting local expansions of Northrop-Grumman, Marriott, and attracting Amazon, for their investment in more Maryland job growth.",Yes,"Public safety has always been a top priority.  Having served on the police commission, I want to ensure our law enforcement officers have adequate protection for themselves.  Increased success in recruiting quality and community-minded new officers is dependent on many issues, including competitive  pay compensation, work environment, benefits, and knowing that their rights are protected as well.  I will continue to support policies that provide access and transparency, such as body cameras, and dissemination of public information to the appropriate parties that represent the rights and safety of our citizens as well.","We have seen too many citizens fall victim to this crisis across the state and nation.  That is why I passionate advocate for integrated behavioral health in addressing (depression, poverty etc) that lead to substance abuse, and supported the prescription drug monitoring program and the Governor's $500 million (that seems really high?) appropriation to battle this epidemic. I also supported legislation this session to require doctors to have a conversation with their patients about the addictive nature of prescription opioids.   I will continue to support bills and measures that address this issue in our schools through policies and programs, the Narcan program and accessibility to it, and stronger support for recovery facilities and counselors.  But we also need to support law enforcement and increased prosecution and punishments against kingpins and drug dealers, particularly any association with violence and guns as dealers of opioids.","I want to see a plan for aggressively identifying the forensics causes of the income inequality our lower income and impoverished citizens throughout Maryland, in a manner comparable to the Kirwan Commission in identifying how to improve our education system.  Once these dynamics are identified, then target for specific policy solutions that incentivize business and private/public partnerships designed to align opportunities to pair these individuals with economic opportunities.  This year, I sponsored and co-sponsored several bills to make community college more affordable, and to provide equipment to schools needed for job certifications.","I have a strong record of voting for increased transparency, disclosure, ethics, throughout my years of public service.  Engaging our citizens, affording them the opportunity to participate and gain the public information is central to good government, and the people's trust in their elected servants. However, there is always more we can do to ensure that Maryland state government is open and accessible to the people we blessed to represent.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

,YES,state-senate,44,Aletheia McCaskill,McCaskill,2/1/2069,Baltimore,Democratic,Baltimore County,,,,,Villa Julie College  College of Notre Dame of Maryland,Former IT professional for Johns Hopkins Hospital and 25 year owner and operator of Tender Tots Family Child Care Center in Western Baltimore County,"To my knowledge, the Kirwan Commission has not yet released its findings, and its process for issuing recommendations with regards to funding reforms has been delayed until later this year.  As an early learning professional, I am keenly aware of the importance of investing in our children and their learning, I will continue to monitor closely and be prepared to respond appropriately on behalf of the Baltimore City and County kids.","NO- Governor Hogan's irresponsible decision to cancel the red line is one of the many reasons why its of vital importance that Maryland elect a new Governor with a responsible attitude towards ensuring that ALL of District 44's residents have access to transportation which facilitates an easy commute to areas where more jobs are located.  I believe that the State absolutely has the resources to meet our transportation needs, it is a simple matter of appropriate prioritization.  This is one of the chief areas where I believe our District needs a more energetic voice in Annapolis advocating for the needs of West Baltimore and Western Baltimore County.","Given the enforcement regime's disproportionate impact on young men of color, I believe that the just thing to do is to legalize the possession of small amount of marijuana, provided that it is by adults and is not used in public or while operating a motor vehicle or while in the company of young people.",I support raising the State's renewable portfolio standard to 50% by 2030.  I support finally passing a Joint Resolution through the Legislature to make clear the Assembly's opposition to offshore oil and gas drilling i support legislation that would have banned the use of polystyrene (foam products) as they are terribly damaging to the Bay and its attendant fragile eco system.,I support Democratic Gubernatorial Candidate Ben Jealous' Medicare for All plan as the best and fastest way to ensure vitally needed health care services are available to the broad spectrum of Marylanders in need.,"I believe that the State should be a partner in funding critical early intervention programs such as Safe Streets and CeaseFire Baltimore.  I believe strongly that underwriting and increased resources for indigenous, community based violence prevention programming is perhaps THE single most important thing the State can do to stem the tide of violent crime in the streets of Baltimore.","I believe that, currently, Maryland businesses mostly get a fair shake in Maryland.  This is evidenced by the continued increase in the profitability across most business sectors.  To the extent, however, that Maryland or Baltimore City or County have business regulations that are overly restrictive or redundant or potentially conflicting- I believe that it is our responsibility, as lawmakers , to make that right.","I would support an independent body, but only in concert with neighboring states that lean as heavily Republican as Maryland does Democratic- Otherwise- for Maryland to enter into a non partisan process as States like West Virginia and Ohio continue to gerrymander their Congressional Districts in favor of Republicans amounts to unilateral disarmament on the part of Democrats and as a proud Democrat, I strongly feel that would be a mistake.","NO- I believe that the LEOBR tilts too heavily towards protecting the right of police officers at the expense of the community who has seen far too many instances of police misconduct in its midst.  My district contains one of the epicenters of the unrest following the tragic death of Freddie Gray- for policing to work in communities across the 44th, we MUST do all we can to ensure a greater level of community connection with the vital function of law enforcement- disproportionate measures like LEOBR work to erode that level of trust and connection- while there are many improvements I would look forward to considering- we should immediately start by placing civilians on review boards in Baltimore City.","I believe that first and foremost- we must commit to the resources to provide treatment on demand for Marylanders suffering under the weight of addiction who make the courageous choice to finally get well.  In addition, I believe that increased resources for working with young people to prevent them ever starting down the path that leads to addiction is also a critical piece of the puzzle.","There are numerous ways but we can start with immediately passing the Fight for $15 bill, which would gradually raise the minimum wage in Maryland to $15 hour- while its not nearly enough as the rise in the minimum wage has fallen woefully behind the cost of living index, it is a modest start on the journey towards ensuring the dignity of work and we must get started NOW !   In addition, as a Union member, I have seen first hand the power of collective bargaining to enhance the lives of represented workers and ensure greater pay and fairness in the work place.  As a legislator, I would do all I could to ensure that all Marylanders have the same right, should they choose, that I did- to join a Union and join together with fellow workers to negotiate pay and benefits with a common employer.",No- I believe there is much that we can do to facilitate Marylanders' access to their own government.  First and foremost- we should lead by example in Annapolis and allow for the video taping of floor sessions and committee voting sessions where the vast majority of the real work gets done.,"Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

McCray,McCray,10/31/1982,Baltimore,Democratic,Baltimore City,http://www.electcorymccray.com,electcoryMccray,electcorymccray,http://surveygizmoresponseuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/fileuploads/296249/4297291/52-8b39a27d6046d0a7ad7d463382a14dc1_cm2015_%281%29.jpg,"Fairmount-Harford Institute (Baltimore City Public Schools, 2001), International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Apprenticeship (2008), Associates Degree in Business Administration - Baltimore City Community College (2011), Bachelors Degree in Business Administration - National Labor College (2014)",Journeyman Electrician with the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 24 / Small Business Owner,"Yes, I support the Commission's findings, and am committed to funding the reforms outlined in its 5 areas of policy recommendations. I believe reinstating Maryland's ""millionaire's tax"" and returning Maryland's estate tax to a progressive framework that is lower than the federal level are important first steps to finding the funding these reforms will require. I also believe that putting casino revenue in a ""lock box"" that supplements rather than replaces existing education funding, while restoring non-casino funding to its pre-casino levels, can help bridge the funding gap. Maryland could also save hundreds of millions of dollars annually by aggressively reducing its prison population the way other states around the nation have- states like Texas, Georgia, New York, and California have reduced their prison populations by over 20% in recent years. If Maryland legalizes adult use of marijuana, the resulting revenue should also be tabbed for education funding, and required to supplement rather than supplant existing funds.","No, our transportation spending is not appropriately balanced. Study after study shows that putting more lanes on a highway does not actually reduce traffic: getting more residents to use public transportation, however, necessarily reduces traffic. The only way to get more residents to embrace public transportation, however, is to invest in a quality of public transportation that is fast, clean, reliable, and convenient. We simply cannot do that with our current transportation spending balance, which leads our population-centers like Baltimore to suffer by comparison to their competition in cities like DC, Philadelphia, and Boston. The state has the resources it needs to meet these needs- it need only change its spending allocations to give public transportation a greater share of the budget.   The Baltimore region- and Baltimore in particular- are not adequately served by transit. We have turned many of our neighborhood main streets into miniature highways used primarily by commuters from surrounding counties and the City's periphery, to devastating effect on our neighborhoods' ability to access nearby anchors- Druid Hill Park is a perfect example of this problem. 1 in 4 Baltimoreans lives in poverty, and many more who do not live in poverty still lack regular access to an automobile. Better spending on better public transportation is a solution that will give these residents greater access to opportunity, but it will also improve our City's appeal to other potential residents looking for a community that keeps pace with the 21st Century's ever increasing embrace of public transportation.","I support the legalization of adult use marijuana if it is accompanied by a proper regulatory framework, and its revenue is sequestered for spending on increased equity in Education.","As a member of the House of Delegates, I have voted to extend protections on our fisheries, reduce pollution from fertilizers and insecticides, and move Maryland's energy sector and its workers towards a more green economy.    An equitable solution that accounts for the needs of chicken farmers but recognizes the environmental reality of their impact on the Bay must be taken if we're serious about protecting it as a resource. We should also invest more aggressively in restorative infrastructure projects for the Bay that both improve its health and return it to its historic form, by introducing more oyster beds to serve as water filtration systems, and more restorative flora projects so that native grasses can help prevent beach erosion.   Maryland can and should also continue to extend the length of our commitment to the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, and increase the percentage of renewable energy that it requires.","In lieu of a true single payer system, which countries around the world demonstrate can work quite effectively, Maryland must continue to expand the funding levels available to applicants through the Maryland Health Exchange. Expanding medicare and medicaid coverage, offering seniors more competitive prescription costs and more affordable generic-prescription alternatives, and expanding enrollment for the Health Exchange to be year round would all be steps in the right direction.","State Government should allow the Baltimore Police Department to focus wholly on criminal enforcement, by permanently assigning the Maryland State Police to perform tasks like highway patrol in the City. State Government should also commit to more aggressive annual funding contributions to violence interruption programs like Safe Streets. State Government could also improve the relationship between the Baltimore Police Department and the residents it serves by passing legislation that improves oversight of the Baltimore Police Department, like requiring civilian participation in all police misconduct hearing boards, and requiring an apparatus for civilian oversight of community policing in Baltimore. The state should also help restore trust in BPD by conducting audits, ensure efficiency and effectiveness by redistricting our police districts every 10 years and ensuring dollars appropriated by the State of Maryland for community policing is utilized for community policing.","Maryland's business climate is clearly friendly enough- the high average income levels and low unemployment rates for the state cannot be chalked up entirely to government employment, after all. The problem is that BIG businesses play far too great a role in influencing public policy that ultimately harms workers and small businesses alike.   The best way to create more family-supporting jobs is to require that all jobs be family supporting. That means passing legislation like a $15 minimum wage, but it also means requiring the State of Maryland to  expand affordable, quality healthcare coverage and improve public transit. Businesses benefit from more punctual, more healthy, less stressed workers. Why shouldn't they contribute financially to helping generate those outcomes?","I do, so long as it is clear that our Governor and legislative leaders would actually commit to a truly independent body. As a representative of one of the most impoverished districts in the State of Maryland, I take a strong position on ensuring that my district is represented fairly, along with stakeholders across our great State of Maryland.","No, it does not balance protections among the two groups. LEOBOR must allow for increased accountability to the public, and a role for the public in regulating police misconduct. Perhaps the greatest opportunity for LEOBOR reform is allowing citizens to serve on police misconduct hearing boards.","We need to augment the strong framework created by the HOPE and Keep the Door Open Acts, by providing the health-based programs they create with more funding so that they can serve more citizens. Opioid addiction must be treated as a health problem at all levels of state-interaction with addicts though, not as a crime problem. This includes de-criminalizing homelessness and its associated acts, so that addicts who experience housing insecurity are given the treatment they deserve, rather than winding up in a jail cell where their situation will only get worse. Moreover, it must be acknowledged that in every state where adult use marijuana is legalized, opioid addictions has fallen, in no small part because of marijuana's utility as a pain killer.","Income inequality can be addressed both by greater equality of opportunity and greater baseline guarantees for employee compensation. For equality of opportunity, that means a stronger education system that provides better pathways to employment through career on-ramps like organized labor supported apprenticeship programs. For better guarantees of family-supporting employee compensation, that means a $15 minimum wage, stronger prevailing wage guarantees for skilled trades, universal access to healthcare coverage, better fair housing oversight so that more Marylander's have access to home ownership as a vehicle for long term wealth.","There is always an opportunity to improve transparency by requiring that government agencies respond more quickly and more constructively to PIA requests from the public. I believe that an ability to exercise greater oversight of the government hinges heavily on campaign finance reform though. Montgomery County has made great strides at a municipal level towards allowing grassroots candidates to run competitive campaigns with public financing, and every municipality in the state deserves to benefit from that same opportunity. By making campaigns less dependent on well-heeled donors, we increase the strength of the average citizen's voice, and by strengthening that voice, we allow government to become more beholden to their oversight, and less beholden to special interests.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

B.A. in Education Policy from Davidson College, 2013.  M.S. in Educational Studies from The Johns Hopkins University, 2015.  Graduate Certificate in School Administration from The Johns Hopkins University, 2016.","Secondary Social Studies Teacher, Baltimore City Public Schools, 2013-2016.  Special Assistant to the Chief of Staff, Baltimore City Public Schools, 2016-2017.","Yes and yes. My time working in Baltimore City Public Schools revealed two crises facing public education: the chronic underfunding of our schools, and the chronic misalignment of our educational practices from international best practices. The Kirwan Commission presents the greatest opportunity in a generation to do something about these challenges, and I fully support the preliminary findings. We need to improve and expand early childhood education, invest in our teachers and administrators, enrich our curriculum, provide more resources for at-risk students, and provide stronger governance and accountability. Who we elect in these 2018 elections will determine who is at the table when decisions are made about how an entire generation of students experience public schools in the state of Maryland. I believe we need former educators at the table when these decisions are made. The stakes are high. And not just for our kids. Maryland's economic future is on the line. We have to get this right. This isn't a matter of whether we can afford these reforms, it's a matter of whether we can afford not to.","No. Many of my students had to travel three hours a day round trip just to get to school and back on public transit. Things aren't any better for adults. It's hard to have a job you can't get to. We need to expand and improve our rail and bus systems. We already have revenue generating mechanisms to pay for these improvements, it is a matter of priorities.",I support the further decriminalization of marijuana and expanded availability of expungement for marijuana related offenses. I believe that we should proceed very cautiously toward legalization by focusing on Maryland's current efforts to make medical marijuana accessible while also watching closely what is happening in states where legalization has already occurred.,"The Chesapeake Bay and the waterways that feed into it are precious resources we must take actions to protect. We need to reduce trash, litter, and other types of pollution that hurt the bay and threaten the quality of life in our neighborhoods. To that end, we should increase penalties for point-source and run-off pollution, and increase enforcement capabilities. The state should also be more aggressively restoring wetlands along our rivers and coasts to protect against rising waters as well as helping to naturally clean the Chesapeake. But pollution in Maryland is about more than just the Chesapeake. Sixteen percent of the state's worst polluters are located in the poorest one percent of its neighborhoods. With a federal government so intent on dismantling environmental protections Maryland has to step up and protect its residents from polluters and the effects of climate change.","I believe that everyone should be able to buy-in to an affordable healthcare plan. Most existing government health care programs are controlled by the federal government, but Maryland can use its control over Medicaid to greatly expand health care coverage. Maryland should institute Medicaid rules that either cover all Marylanders or allow Marylanders to buy in to Medicaid at an affordable rate. Getting more people on Medicaid will lower healthcare costs for individuals and increase the bargaining power of Medicaid, allowing it to negotiate lower prices.","The state can play a stronger role in helping Baltimore address violent crime in a variety of ways. In the short term the state should offer grants to help improve crime-fighting technology and should insist on coordinated cross-agency warrant efforts between local and state officials. In the mid-term we need to overhaul our criminal justice system to connect those in incarceration to education and job training. Baltimore City has a 70% recidivism rate by some estimates. Improving our criminal justice system to connect inmates to the services they need to re-enter society should be a top priority. In the long term, Maryland can help us reduce violent crime in Baltimore by fully funding and modernizing our public education system. Good schools create healthy neighborhoods, attract business, and lead to more people being fully employed. Implementing the Kirwan Commission's reforms will help Baltimore reduce violent crime in the years and decades to come.","Unemployment in the 41st district is twice the national average and wages are stagnant. While there have been high profile efforts to attract national corporations to the region, we need to remain focused on investing in our local economy by investing in local businesses and local workers. I support a statewide $15 minimum wage and expanding collective bargaining. To attract more jobs to Baltimore the state should be improving services in the city and all over Maryland. Better schools and adult training programs will ensure that businesses have qualified workers. Safer streets will make Baltimore a more attractive place to live and work. A better transportation system will connect businesses to the workforce. Cities with better services are more attractive to employees and employers, and the state of Maryland should help Baltimore with all of these priorities.","Absolutely. Voters should choose their representatives, not the other way around. I support the creation of a non-partisan, independent body to draw our maps by 2020 -- and I hope other states do too.","No. The Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights (LEOBOR) protects police at the expense of the public. Police officers are highly trained, yet they face a standard for the use of deadly force that is no higher than the average Marylander. And they receive protections from investigation that go far beyond those afforded to most of us. We should establish a statewide use of force policy to clearly explain when and why force is necessary, and officers suspected of a crime should not be afforded protections that the rest of us cannot expect.","Low-level users of drugs should be treated, not incarcerated. Maryland should be greatly expanding access to effective treatment, and its enforcement should be targeted at high-level dealers and suppliers along with those who carry out violence on their behalf.","It is the role of government to create opportunity for all residents -- the opportunity to receive a great education, to live in a safe neighborhood, to access affordable health care, and to earn a living wage. In this spirit, our campaign has released a Roadmap to Upward Mobility (jdmerrill.com/plan), which outlines bold actions that can be taken in twelve different policy areas at the state level to address income inequality, create opportunity for all, and grow and strengthen the middle class.","The Public Information Act and open meetings laws are a great start to helping provide oversight of the government. But it is still too easy for our government to ignore or work around these laws. We need to do more to make the work of government visible to the public. Attendance and voting records are currently hidden in hard to understand and difficult to access journals and websites. The rules of the General Assembly and past pay records are difficult if not impossible to find for the general public. Legislators should be willing to open their books and publish, in real time, when they show up to work, their excuse if they have an excused absence, and how they voted on every bill and amendment in committee and on the floor. The Maryland General Assembly's website should be user friendly and allow residents to clearly understand how their government works.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

,YES,state-senate,44,Shirley Nathan-Pulliam,Nathan-Pulliam,5/20/1939,Windsor Mill,Democratic,Baltimore County,http://www.shirleynathan-pulliam.com,,,,"MAS, John Hopkins University  Bachelor of Science in Nursing, University of Maryland A.A. in Nursing Community College of Baltimore",Registered Nurse Business Owner Legislator,"I support the findings for the Kerwan Commission and especially want to work to ensure that the appropriate resources are allocated for early childhood education, quality teachers, and equalizing funding for at  risk students many of whom are in areas of concentrated poverty.   Yes, I am committed to the funding reforms and would work with the Governor and legislative leaders to increase funding.  I supported SB 1122 which amends the Maryland Constitution to ensure that casino revenue would be dedicated to education and cannot be diverted to other spending. This adds up to approximately $500 million to Maryland Schools over four years.   I also supported the bill to expand Senatorial and Delegate scholarships to include certificate programs.","No, the current resource spending for roads and transit are not balanced. The state needs to allocate more funding to bring the old  infrastructure  up to par. Currently the transit system is very disjointed for commuters. The Baltimore Link is not able to connect the volume of commuters that would have had more access  and job opportunities with the redline.",No I do not support this.,"The State should work hand in hand with industry and the states that share the Chesapeake Bay,  Virginia and Delaware to develop strategies that will protect the Chesapeake and provide the necessary oversight to ensure safety and restoration.","A bill was introduced that allowed Maryland to apply for a 1332 waiver from federal government to be able to implement a reinsurance program to stabilize the individual insurance market, if granted Maryland could leverage federal funds with state funds to provide relief to individuals.   Additionally, there was a bill that requires a 2.75% assessment on insurance companies for 1 year, this is estimated to raise  $380 million dollars for a state reinsurance program that would help to stabilize the insurance market.   These bills would help during the interim while the Commission on Health Insurance works to develop a permanent solution.","I have supported legislation that focuses on reinvestment in quality schools, job opportunities with the understanding that the outgrowth from these programs would help to stabilize communities and reduce violent crimes.   A critical component is also to create policy that would address gun violence through stronger gun protection laws.  I would also support legislation that provides oversight and safeguards against corruption that has led to distrust in communities. By providing  additional training for officers and incentives for them to  live in the communities they police this could have a positive impact as well.","I think the business climate is fairly  stable in Maryland. In order to create more family supporting jobs the state needs to reduce taxes, provide incentives for businesses, encourage start-ups, and provide competitive wages and benefits.","Yes I will support this body, but I think it would be difficult to find people that do not favor one part over the over.","I am concerned due to the recent exposure of officers in large corruption trial in Baltimore. Police officers risk their lives to protect the public and should have adequate protections, however there is no balance and protection of the public when officers think they are above the law. This bill of rights should be reviewed to ensure it fully addresses theses concerns.",The provision of education and awareness to the public of what opioids actually are and funding for education to obtain and use naloxone.,"The State should equalize the payment for women for the job that they are performing , instead of paying them  $.84 cent on the dollar.","Yes, I believe both of these laws allows for transparency.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

There are some  really good ideas for improving education, particularly literacy and expanding career and technology education but there has also been a lot of big picture talking without enough practical detail. I'm committed to funding education adequately, but not ready to commit to all of their recommendations.","Maryland has, for too long, de-emphasized roads and bridges - which is primarily what the gas tax is supposed to go towards. I'm not against some transit spending, but until Governor Hogan's election four years ago, less than 30% of the Transportation Trust Fund was going to roads and bridges. That's been appropriately reversed over the last four years and I support continuing investments in Maryland's overall road and transportation system. Governor Hogan has invested wisely in both road capacity expansion and the mass transit projects that will actually be used.",No. I have supported medical marijuana legalization and criminal justice reforms that allow for more second chances and treatment for non-violent drug crimes but do not support legalizing recreational use.,The federal government has actually continued to increase funding aimed at actually cleaning up the Chesapeake Bay. Any potential budget cuts in that category have been ruled out by Congress and the proposed cuts were not focused on the cleanup portion of EPA Chesapeake Bay funds. Maryland should continue the Hogan administration's  focus on cleaning up and dredging the Conowingo Dam and interstate compacts that ensure that all states in the watershed are shouldering the burden of the pollution that they are responsible for.,"Often the focus of the health care debate nationally is wrongly centered on the cost of insurance instead of the cost of care. Finding ways to reduce the overall  cost of care - caused partly by the way the system is driven by the negotiation between insurance companies and providers, legal issues, and still lagging modernization of health records and technology are all factors in why health insurance and care are so expensive.  The current federal intervention in health insurance is unsustainable and has led to skyrocketing premiums. Some additional possible solutions include greater use of health savings accounts and going back to the high risk pool model for insuring those who cannot get conventional insurance.","Baltimore's state and local leaders need to embrace real reforms in how we deal with repeat criminals, particularly those who use guns in commission of crimes. There is far too much leniency in both prosecution and sentencing. The state has been providing significant funds for decades, and Governor Hogan has helped with funds that are being used to knock down vacant, dangerous buildings. A change in perspective from those in leadership in both city government and the community in Baltimore is needed towards holding the criminal element responsible for their actions and protecting the vulnerable residents.","Maryland's business climate is improving thanks to Governor Hogan's relentless focus on making state agencies more customer friendly and responsive, as well as removing unneeded regulation on job creators. We need to do more of that, and continue to reform our tax code and regulatory code to incentivize innovation and hard work. Another step is continuing to reform professional licensing so that it's easier for people to get into professions like cosmetology, professional services, and custodial work. The best kind of job is one where the person can own their own destiny and even employ others. Maryland's made progress on this but outdated licensing requirements that are not always safety-related can get in the way of someone trying to work their way up.","Yes, I've co-sponsored Governor Hogan's legislation on that each year. I also participated in lawsuits against the current map back in 2011 when it was being considered.",I support LEOBR. Any changes to it should be negotiated through the typical collective bargaining process as all other professions with collective bargaining do. It is the height of liberal hypocrisy to treat all public sector unions and their agreements as totally infallible but make an exception for our law enforcement.,"In 2016, I was a co-sponsor and supporter of Justice Reinvestment which included changes to law that allow people",Reducing the overall tax burden and cost of doing business will help create more good-paying jobs. Overall the cost of living for working families and the working poor in our state is far too high. Policies that reduce cost of living have been a top priority for me as a state legislator.,We have a pretty strong act although there is sometimes confusion about the rights people have to request information or attend meetings. That's why I've consistently supported mandated training requirements for government staff and elected officials to understand their responsibility and Governor Hogan's proposals to live stream all General Assembly floor sessions.,"Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

Robinson,Robinson,,Baltimore,Democratic,Baltimore City,http://www.senatorbarbararobinson.com,,,http://surveygizmoresponseuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/fileuploads/296249/4297291/191-5a2fe7e77b5b256b83354b3c04ab352a_SenatorRobinsonHeadshot.jpg,Bachelor's Degree from the Univ. of Baltimore Master's Degree from Coppin State Univ. C.A.S.E. from the Johns Hopkins Univ.,"Deputy Administrator of the District Court, the Supreme Bench and the Circuit Court, entrepreneur for more than 30 years, adjunct college professor, an educator, an international motivational speaker and seminar developer and facilitator, the author of six published books, a board member of 10 organizations, a member of the Maryland House of Delegates for 10 years, a State Senator for two years.","I do support the Commission's findings. I would use money from the Education Trust Fund, I voted on the ""lockbox"" bill that asks voters to approve a constitutional amendment that will establish the lockbox law. This law will ensure that money will not be diverted from the casino funds to balance the budget, but will be used for education. The lock box bill is intended to prevent future governors and lawmakers from diverting casino funds toward balancing the budget. We allocated an additional $200 million in new education funding, using additional tax revenue that residents are expected to pay in state taxes because of changes in the federal tax code.","No Maryland's transportation spending is not appropriately balanced between roads and transit. The state now has the resources to meet its transportation needs. The governor has allocated an extra $178 million over three years to the state agency that operates the subway. Legislation also passed to require Maryland to award a $167 million annual grant to the Washington Metro but legislation was also  included in that grant for  MTA to receive added impetus when the Baltimore Metro was forced to shut down for repairs. The Baltimore region is not adequately served by transit. It takes some people three busses to reach their jobs. Often the busses arrive either too late or too early for some employees at certain businesses. With small businesses opening and needing employees, the hindrance is inadequate transportation to those jobs. In the healthcare industry with group homes, transitional living arrangements and other residential facilities for seniors and people with developmental disabilities, they are hurting for employees because of inadequate transportation to those facilities.",I support the legalization of recreational marijuana because of the crime associated with territorial gang-wars and young people fighting and getting killed over drug trafficking. I also look at the amount of revenue marijuana can generate. Our schools and transit system can benefit from that extra money. I also look at the blight in our neighborhoods that can certainly prosper from additional funding that can be generated by small businesses in the marijuana industry paying taxes and contributing to the economy and to the neighborhood.,"Maryland should make an effort to keep trash and garbage from the Bay. We pay attention to harmful chemicals going into the Bay. We monitor the pesticides used by farmers but we don't pay enough attention to trash and garbage in the city that rainwater carries into the Bay. Some neighborhoods are riddled with trash and garbage in the streets, especially areas where fast food businesses are located. Maryland needs to invest more money in keeping the streets and vacant lots clean so that sewers will not be a direct route for trash to travel into the Bay.","Maryland should ensure that everyone can afford healthcare. Some small businesses that employ people with families cannot afford healthcare alone. However if there was a consortium or a collaboration of small businesses where they could purchase services as a group the cost would be affordable. Additionally if small businesses would belong to a chamber they could offer a low premium for small businesses to purchase services for their employees. Generic drugs as opposed to name-brand drugs would be more affordable to low-income families. I would re-implement the Individual Mandate in the State of Maryland that trump did away with a new senate tax bill. Also, I would tax Health insurance companies within the state a certain percentage, then take that money and use it to help subsidize rising insurance premiums in Maryland.","The state should invest more money in the police force thereby being able to employ more police officers as foot-patrol officers to patrol the neighborhoods. The legislation that passed this session is a step in the right direction, stronger laws for repeat offenders, stronger gun laws, more programs for prevention rather than intervention, making the relationship between citizens and the police force more trustworthy by mandating that police officers participate in cultural sensitive training and really implement the legislation SB 1099 and SB 122 from the 2018 session.","Maryland's business climate is growing; however, access to capital is the number one factor that prevents small businesses from succeeding, The state can help foster the creation of more family-supporting jobs by making the certification process easier and making the certification requirements for city, state, and county acceptable. Additionally if the state would implement regulations of local-preferences that would allow Maryland businesses to be considered for projects before out of state businesses.","Yes, I do.",No is does not balance protection for police and the public because with so much corruption reported concerning the police department and with the shootings of citizens by the police there is no trust. The LEOBR should be changed. I was chair of the Legislative Black Caucus when seventeen bills did not leave the Judiciary Department in the House of Delegates. A committee was formed to address that and the LEOBR was addressed during the meetings of that committee. A Civilian Review Board was a part of that discussion. I think we need to revisit the issues raised by the Justice Reinvestment Act.,"This problem is not new. We had problems with opioid addiction in the 1970s when the young generation who are now grandparents of young people who abuse drugs were themselves opioids. With prescriptions being given for pain and for depression older people are overdosing, I would look for society to provide more programs to educate the young generation about the danger of drugs. I would invest more money into job training and apprenticeship programs to get young people off the streets and to channel their minds to use their creativeness. I would put more money into research to find alternatives to drugs to offset the need for pain pills.","The state should ensure that equal pay is provided for equal work. More and more households are being managed by single women. Because they are bread-winners, a sufficient income to take care of their families is important. A person should be paid according to the job and how well the duties and responsibilities are handled not according to gender, race, or age.","No, because it does not extend far enough.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education? Are you committed to funding associated reforms, and if so, how?","Is Maryland’s transportation spending appropriately balanced between roads and transit?

We must ensure that our children will be able to compete in a global world that values creativity, innovation, scientific knowledge, and team work. We must also ensure that all of our children can find a meaningful place in their chosen communities. The Commission's report recognizes that funding will be needed to accomplish these tasks. It's premature to look for ways to fund the reforms without having an understanding of the overall costs. What is clear is that success will require investment in time, talent and funds from the State and local jurisdictions, business and community partners and families.","Roads continue to be favored over transit. This transportation funding prioritization adds to congestion and the headache of getting to work in urban and suburban areas of the state.  Building new metro and train lines is costly and not necessarily the best use of transportation dollars. Utilizing existing roadways to build bus rapid transit (BRT) is an opportunity that must be explored.  Existing roadways supporting BRT would disperse transit into communities at much less cost, thereby creating a greater network of connectivity within the state. Increased connectivity would benefit employers by expanding their hiring area and benefit workers by reducing commuting times.","I do, but the decision about whether to legalize marijuana in Maryland must rest with the voters as it has in other states.","State government should monitor and ensure that local jurisdictions are meeting their watershed implementation and MS4 permit goals. These goals are crafted to utilize each jurisdictions assets and allow each county to determine how to spread the remedies across all sectors. In counties like Howard, where farms abut residential communities, the state through MDE and MDA should be promoting projects like the stream restoration project on the Patrick farm in western Howard County that reduces the impact of local stormwater runoff from Lisbon while limiting the introduction of nutrients from the farm into the waterways. Given that taxpayers currently pay for Bay restoration, government needs to ensure that all property owners are part of the effort.","Maryland lawmakers should maintain the expansion of Medicaid.  Also, they should standardize payments for wellness care, preventative screenings, treatment and prescription drugs to ensure that public funds can serve as many enrollees as possible.  Additional sources of revenue, such as taxes paid from the medical marijuana industry can support affordable health care.","The State should lend expertise to the City through the Attorney General's office, the State Police, the Governor's Office of Homeland Security and the Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services. In addition, the State can assist City leaders by working collaboratively to expand employment opportunities.  When families have good jobs, they can afford housing and provide food security which positively impacts children. State money could also be spent on summer jobs for youth, youth diversion programs, and gun buybacks.","I've been central to improving the business climate in Howard County through zoning, the use of a P3, and economic development. Approaches like this can be valuable in other parts of the state. As I've learned, during two tax increment financing decisions, government can demand that private business wanting governmental help can be required pay a living wage and give opportunities to women and minority owned businesses both during construction and after. In addition, This year's commitment to funding the DC Metro system shows that the State's commitment to quality transportation is good for business.","I support an independent commission to recommend districts that have a similar population size, include contiguous neighborhoods and are compact.  Districts need to ensure ethnic and racial diversity so that no votes are suppressed because all votes should be equal.","I haven't had experience with this issue, but recently confirmed abuses in Baltimore have exposed the need to review the LEOBR.","A strategy to combat opioid addiction must include: treatment for those struggling with addiction, proactive law enforcement to eliminate the availability of drugs within communities, public education at all levels focusing on the destructive effects of opioids and other addictive drugs, and requiring prescribing doctors to limit quantities of opioids and to carefully monitor their use.","In addition to raising the minimum wage, the State can create jobs through investment in infrastructure, aggressively use Low Income Housing Tax credits to promote housing affordability,  commit to affordable high-quality childcare through childcare subsidies and tax credits, partner to create apprenticeships and earn-while-you-learn programs, revise state law to reduce over criminalization and incarceration thereby freeing up funding for education, and ensure equal pay for women.","Yes, I believe they do, because the laws require that the public's business be done in an open, accessible location with as much notice as possible and provide for broad access to information. They give the public the opportunity to follow government proceedings and get engaged with issues. Technology makes it easier to be engaged as meetings are broadcast and streamed and can be archived for viewing at a later time. Reports are available via websites which helps cut down on the cost to the public for documents. Should Marylanders suspect that they aren't being served by these laws they can register complaints with the Public Information Act Compliance Board or the Open Meetings Compliance Board.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

Completed a Masters in Government from Johns Hopkins in 2006 and then returned to William and Mary for Law school which I completed in 2009.,State Senate and Attorney,"Yes. The Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education, otherwise known as the Kirwan Commission, has produced a set of critical policy recommendations aimed at ensuring Maryland schools become the best in the nation.  Those recommendations range from creating greater incentives for teacher competitiveness to funding for universal pre-kindergarten.  To those ends, I am committed to fully implementing the recommendations contained within the report as long as the needs of the entire state are kept in mind.  Specifically, Montgomery County has the fastest growing and most diverse school population in the state - I will not support a funding formula that puts the largest - fastest growing - and most diverse jurisdiction in a position such that it does not receive its fair share of funding.","While we need to invest in road repair and infrastructure enhancement, the State needs to invest more heavily in smart transit such as rail and dedicated bus lanes through out the state. The Baltimore Region is certainly undeserved and we must ensure we continue to support ideas like the Red Line .","Yes, in fact I have been the lead sponsor on legislation to legalize, tax and regulate recreational marijuana.","Maryland should continue to invest in Chesapeake Bay Clean up and Restoration projects. Additionally we need to continue our work in implement proactive measures like strict liability for offshore drilling, legislation I supported and which passed this legislative session.","Our state needs to secure the individual market such that the cost of health insurance premiums are affordable for all Marylanders.  For instance, I supported legislation this past legislative session that creates a temporary Reinsurance program, which will help cover the most expensive claims from people insured on the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange.","The state can and must implement legislation that fully funds initiatives like the Baltimore Safe Streets Initiative, the Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion Program, Victim and Witness relocation, The Baltimore Chesapeake Bay Outward Bound School in Baltimore City, and the Baltimore City Strategic Decision Support Centers. In addition to these programs we must also ensure that Baltimore City Public Schools receives proper funding and child care programs are expanded to assist working parents and to provide an enriching environment for children to thrive.","Maryland's business climate is good but it can be so much better. In effort to create a business friendly ecosystem we need to make smart investments in transit (rail and BRT), affordable housing, and our public school system.  Small and large businesses need these core elements to thrive - employees need accessible and affordable housing; their children need world-class schools to attend, and everyone needs an affordable / accessible mode of transportation to get to and from work.  We could also do a better job in investing in our small businesses.  Our state should look to end corporate tax loopholes that allow large multinational / multi-state corporations to avoid paying local and state taxes (combined reporting).  By ending this practice and through investing more state dollars in small and local businesses we would be well on our way to ensuring we have an equitable business friendly environment in our state.",Yes,No - We still have much more work to be do to ensure adequate civilian oversight and involvement.,As opioid related deaths have continue to rise to record levels in Maryland. The majority of Marylanders who have succumbed to opioid addiction started their addiction through prescription painkillers.  This past session I advocated for legislation that requires doctors to have in-depth conversations with patients about the risks associated with taking prescription painkillers.  Through intense treatment and small steps like this we will be well on our way to combating this epidemic.,"The state should act to raise the minimum wage, ensure fair and equal pay regardless of gender, opportunities for retraining and job certification and expanding access to higher education by lowering costs.","Government can always be more open and transparent. Ideally I'd like to see access to information through the MPIA made more accessible and affordable for the average citizen (sometimes the most in-depth requires monetary payment beyond what our lowest-income citizens can afford). With  respect to the open meetings laws, Maryland could implement policies that ensure greater public notice of meetings beforehand so that citizens have adequate time to plan to attend these meetings should they desire.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

She has spent over 20 years working for Maryland's 43rd District as a legislator, advocate, and teacher of public policy. After college, Washington began her professional career teaching elementary school. Soon thereafter she earned her Ph.D. in sociology at Johns Hopkins University and began her academic career as a professor at Lehigh University, followed by a post-doctoral fellowship at the Population Studies Center at the  University of Pennsylvania. Over the course of her professional career, she has used her skill at bringing together academic institutions, foundations, community-based civic, local and state government agencies, residents and business owners, and researchers in key positions. She has managed programs and complex relationships among public agencies and private stakeholders in Baltimore and the state of Maryland and negotiated effective solutions to real problems those stakeholders face. Currently, she is a member of the Part-time Faculty in the Department of Humanistic Studies at the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA). Elected in 2010 to the House of Delegates, Washington serves as House Chair of the Joint Committee on Ending Homelessness and as a member of the Joint Committee on Children Youth and Families, the Regional Revitalization Task Force, and the Tax Credit Evaluation Committee. She served as Deputy Majority Whip in 2015-16 and on the Unaccompanied Homeless Youth Task Force in 2013-14. She is a member of Women Legislators of Maryland, the Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland and an Associate Member of the Latino Legislative Caucus.","As a member of the Ways and Means committee, I have been an outspoken education advocate and leader calling on the Governor and the General Assembly to immediately fund its preliminary findings.  During this 2018 legislative session, we were able to make a ""downpayment"" on that work through a number of legislative and budgetary actions. The most significant of these reforms is the November referendum to phase-in a $500 million increase for Maryland Pre-K-12 education -- a huge first step to eliminate the $2.9 billion funding shortage facing our public schools. I am committed to securing a new funding formula during the 2019 legislative session. The formula must address the disproportionate impacts of concentrated poverty, racial and ethnic disparities and housing instability on local schools systems across the state and especially in Baltimore City. It must also fix the problem the legislature began to address this session of phantom wealth created by Tax Increment Financings (TIFs). As a social scientist and demographer, I am well-positioned to help create a more equitable funding formula that will enable us to pay teachers like high-level professionals. From a policy perspective, I will continue to champion a community schools strategy that will allow public schools to serve as resources for everyone in high-needs communities. Additionally, I support universal Pre-K and early childhood education. These programs are among the highest-yielding investments we can make in a child's development. Enrolling more low-income children in pre-kindergarten programs will help us get more from our education dollars.","No, it is not appropriately balanced. The Baltimore area continues to be underserved by public transportation, leaving thousands of area residents who cannot afford a vehicle facing long and difficult commutes to reach job centers and finding it difficult to access basic services. The decision to cancel the Red Line was a terrible mistake. I will work with the next governor to try to reverse that decision. While the Baltimore Link system changes were heralded as bringing about improvements in service and connectivity, it has not brought about the integrated, effective public transit Baltimore area residences, businesses and institutions deserve.  Currently, the Hogan Administration spends too much on projects to upgrade lightly-traveled roads in rural parts of the state and is planning to spend too much to add toll lanes and widen the Capital Beltway, I-270 and other expressways. We need to rebalance the equation by spending more to improve public transit, especially in metro Baltimore, and to make our streets friendly to cyclists, pedestrians and buses.  While I support the plan to finance needed investments in the Washington-area Metro system, the Baltimore region faces even greater transit needs. We should be investing resources here in Baltimore to find ways to revive the Red Line or make other East-West travel improvements, better integrate our poorly connected bus, rail and subway lines and make bus service more reliable and more frequent in hard-pressed city neighborhoods.",,"To improve the health of the bay, we need to work harder to limit the expansion of pavement and impervious surfaces in urban and suburban areas and to make sure we deal with stormwater runoff more effectively -- a problem that remains especially acute here in Baltimore, where dated sewer systems regularly cause toxic waste to spill into streams and the bay after hard rains.  One important way we can make this happen is by working harder to make Smart Growth a reality that shapes development decisions in every county in the state. By encouraging development in existing communities, and discouraging sprawl, we can grow in ways that use the infrastructure we now have without adding huge new tracts of pavement and other impervious surfaces that will add to the runoff that degrades our Bay. We also need to make greater efforts to make sure that farmers and poultry producers in rural areas are actually implementing Best Management Practices. While standards for pollution run-off and waste treatment in urban areas are closely monitored, efforts to control agricultural pollution often face only intermittent checks. We will have to devote more resources and energy to auditing and verifying that those practices are being properly implemented. Establishing a manure exchange that would connect poultry producers and farmers with those who want to reuse manure for energy or other purposes is another good way we can limit toxic rural run-off and protect the Bay.","Ultimately, I support a single-payer system in Maryland. Single payer means everyone is in the health care system and no one is left out. It guarantees that everyone has access to care throughout his or her life, regardless of health status or pre-existing conditions. Over time, single-payer is also less expensive and more efficient than our current complex system of multiple public and private insurance systems -- because it saves money on administrative costs, on large salaries and bureaucracies for competing insurance firms and enables the single health care system to negotiate fair prices for pharmaceuticals, medical equipment and hospital rates. Yet while we move in the direction of a true health care for all system, I know we also need to make efforts to improve our existing system by extending more health care coverage to more Marylanders and protecting residents against outrageous health care costs. I support, and was happy to vote for, the legislation we passed this session to shore buttress coverage under Obamacare -- that's an important way to protect Marylanders against the damage the Trump Administration has done, and may yet do, to our health care system. I strongly supported last year's important legislation to stop prescription price-gouging and would be happy to support additional efforts to protect Marylanders against over-priced prescription drugs. I also support the idea of at least beginning to expand our Medicaid program to cover dental services for adults and expand eligibility to more low to middle-income adults.","Ensuring the public safety of our people and restoring their trust in law enforcement is one of the important challenges we face as a City.  Too many of our residents and business owners live in fear of violent crime, which destroys families, blights communities and stalls private investment.  We need to be smart and innovative on crime, not just ""tough."" We need programs to prevent violent crime and attend to the needs of victims and survivors while addressing the socio-economic root causes of crime and preventing recidivism. Building strong relationships between the community and police where both constituencies feel respected, included, and safe is a good start. Making the right kind of public investments means more fully funding schools in distressed communities and funding a community schools model that will turn schools in high-poverty neighborhoods into resources for the whole community. It means more funding for Safe Streets, Community Mediation and other violence-interruption programs along with summer jobs, apprenticeships, recreation centers, and other critical supports. In order to restore trust in law enforcement, the state must also push the city to build a professional police force that protects and respects Baltimore residents.  That means taking strong steps to investigate the abuses committed by those bad actors with a badge and to make sure the city implements the consent decree. We must implement reform by practicing community policing and increasing civilian oversight of police departments with independent civilian review boards with subpoena power.","Maryland's business climate is very strong. Because of our highly educated population, easy access to major transportation corridors, world-leading technology and healthcare industries, and relatively high wages (which give Marylanders strong buying power) Maryland is a  state that is very attractive place to do business. We have been a very business-friendly state, offering tax incentives to large corporations.  Yet being business-friendly does not have to mean being anti-employee. The right way to improve our business climate is not through a race to the bottom -- by cutting taxes, regulations and public services -- but by making smart investments in our people, our schools, and our infrastructure. We must strike a balance that supports families. Making sure Marylanders are well-educated, healthy, and well-paid also makes sure we have a productive, highly-skilled workforce with the resources to also be a very attractive consumer/business market. That helps create a healthy business climate as it enables families to live healthy, prosperous lives. We can improve our business climate -- and create more good jobs -- by building on our assets. We can expand support to local businesses through micro-enterprise or small business loans. We can build an even better-educated workforce by making college more affordable and eliminating tuition at community colleges. We can help young adults who aren't college-bound build valuable job skills by providing more vocational education in high schools and funding apprenticeship and job-training programs. We can improve our transportation system by making new investments in rail and other public transportation.","Yes, I support the concept of a non-partisan, equitable and independent body and process to implement and make recommendations for decennial redistricting of congressional and legislative districts.","No, the LEOBR does not balance protections for police and the public appropriately. The reforms to that statute the legislature approved in 2016 have helped -- especially by reducing the number of days police officers under investigation can avoid being questioned from 10 to five and increasing the time citizens have to file a complaint on a police officer that leads to an investigation from 90 days to one year. Yet we need to make further reforms to enable the community to exercise full and timely oversight of police conduct.   Five days remains a very long time to allow a police officer accused of brutality or serious misconduct to be allowed to avoid being questioned while seeking legal counsel -- a right no one else accused of serious misconduct enjoys. At the same time, the LEOBR rule that allows only sworn law enforcement officers to conduct an investigation of an officer that may lead to disciplinary action prevents civilian review boards from exercising meaningful oversight and remains a major barrier to civilians holding police accountable. Like everyone else, police officers deserve due process and fair treatment when accused of a crime or serious misconduct. But continuing to insulate them against being questioned in a timely way or being held accountable by civilian police review authorities undermines efforts to establish the kind of police accountability that will help rebuild trust between officers and the community they are supposed to serve and protect.","For many in Baltimore City, the opioid crisis is not new. For decades thousands have died each year, a rate that far exceeds that of the number of homicides in our communities. Increasingly, overdose is now the leading cause of death for people under 50 in Maryland. Addressing this ""crisis"" will require focus and frank dialogue about its root causes and a willingness not to engage policy solutions or political rhetoric that stigmatizes drug dependency, or propose tough-on-crime policies as our only solution. We must support policies to prevent overdose deaths. Those include funding distribution programs for naloxone (an opioid-overdose antidote); authorizing safe-consumption rooms that provide on-site care in the event of an overdose; and rapidly scaling up access to medication-assisted treatment, like methadone and buprenorphine. These are evidence-based interventions that are currently being ignored or underutilized. People who use drugs must be at the center of our response not filling our prisons. In terms of policing, our focus should be on supply chains and not on arresting and criminalizing addiction. We need to seize the drugs before they are distributed. Our state police should work in conjunction with the FBI to police the drug transportation corridors which are within their jurisdiction.","The state can and must take strong steps to address poverty and inequality by bolstering wages, investing more fully in distressed communities, and ensuring women earn fair and adequate wages. Bolstering wages: I strongly support raising MD's minimum wage to $15/hour and indexing it to inflation to protect its value. Because we know union representation helps people earn middle-class incomes, we must also protect union rights and make it easier for more Marylanders to organize and join unions. We also need to remove as many of the barriers that make it difficult for citizens returning from prison to find employment as possible so former felons and their families aren't stuck in poverty. Community investment: We need to fully fund high-quality public schools and community schools in high-needs areas to give young people growing up in poverty the tools they need to enter the workforce. We need to invest in better public transportation to help people in high-poverty areas reach good job opportunities. We need to focus our public investments and housing support programs on investments that help build the value of property and businesses in distressed communities.  Supporting working women: With poverty concentrated among women and female-led households, we need to make sure women earn equal pay for equal work, expand child care subsidies to give more working women access to affordable childcare and take other steps to ensure women earn adequate wages.","Transparency in government is one of my most important values. Currently, too much public business goes on behind closed doors and getting access to what takes place at many meetings of public agencies can often be too difficult. I have heard from many constituents that they have to submit multiple PIA requests before their receive any information.  If we are to be a government of the people, by the people and for the people, we must conduct public business in a way that is accessible to the people.  We must err on the side of making more information available under the umbrella of the state's PIA and open meeting laws. While I strongly supported the 2015 reforms to Maryland's Public Information Act, we can do more to speed up response time for information requests and to help make information available to those who find it difficult to pay for the cost of processing their requests. We also need to amend the PIA to let citizens and the media get more adequate information about how police departments handle abuse complaints. Under current rules, we can learn about the disposition of the complaint but often get very little information about what sort of investigation may have been conducted. I also believe our Open Meetings Act makes it too easy for agencies to effectively opt-out of its requirements by choosing to meet in Executive Session. We should examine ways to narrow their ability to close such meetings to the public and the press.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

Fellow of the ABA Bar Foundation, Fellow of the Maryland Bar Foundation.  Fellow of the Baltimore City Bar Foundation","I am very impressed with the Kirwan Commission's preliminary report.  The Commission did a first class job, and it sets forth an ambitious agenda in order to move Maryland from just ""average"" compared to other states to the ""head of the class"".  I support many of the 59 recommendations of the Commission, particularly those dealing with college and career readiness pathways and governance and accountability.  I have some concerns with the Commission's focus on a much expanded statewide educational program for three and four year olds.  I am not aware of a significant body of research establishing that school for three and four year olds adds measurably to the ultimate academic performance of students, and I fear that such a statewide program would be hugely expensive. For example, with many of our existing elementary schools full to capacity, a statewide system of pre-K schools would necessitate acquiring land and constructing buildings at the neighborhood level and recruiting and training a massive cadre of teachers inasmuch as effective pre-K education requires a very low teacher-pupil ratio. The Kirwan Commission is currently working on cost estimates and potential ways of funding its recommendations.  The preliminary report of the Commission suggests a ten-year phase-in, given the obvious fact that the program will be very expensive.  I am committed to the goals set out in the Commission's Report, but we need to be realistic about the timing of dramatically greater spending on our educational system.","Under Governor Hogan, our transportation spending has become much more balanced.  We are committed to constructing the purple line in the D. C. suburbs and to investing $167 million per year on the D. C. Metro.  For Baltimore City, the Hogan Administration has redrawn ancient bus routings dating from the years just after World War II and has upgraded the rolling stock for the new Baltimore Link system.  For Baltimore County, there is a newly announced commitment to add an extra lane to both the inner loop and the outer loop of the Baltimore Beltway. There is never enough money to pay for everything we want, and that is certainly true in the transportation sphere.  Necessarily, we have to prioritize projects.  I have three goals for the next four years: (1) Complete the extra lanes on the Beltway; (2) Secure funding to implement a Towson Circulator bus that will transport people between Towson University and Goucher College, stopping in between at key central Towson locations; and (3) Enhance the reach of the new Baltimore Link bus system to service communities within the Baltimore metropolitan area that are currently not adequately served.  If the State can provide $167 million each year to the D. C. Metro to facilitate transportation in that part of the State, it should be able to expand the Baltimore Link system so that mass transit is more accessible to the residents of greater Baltimore.","Not at this time.  I support our new system of medical marijuana and have spent a lot of time during the past four years trying to iron out all sorts of glitches with that system.  I also voted in favor of eliminating incarceration as a penalty for those found guilty of possessing small quantities of marijuana.  That said, I am not in favor of total legalization, at least at this time.    There are some pretty scary statistics coming out of Colorado, which legalized marijuana several years ago, showing that the percentage of drivers in fatal car accidents testing positive for marijuana has increased dramatically.  There is currently no way to test a driver for being under the influence of marijuana during the course of a brief roadside stop.  No breathalyzer test, for example.  If a patrolman suspects a driver of being under the influence of marijuana, the only option currently is to obtain a warrant to detain the driver, to take the driver to a location where medical personnel can draw blood from the driver's arm, which can then be analyzed.  This lengthy and highly intrusive process involving courts and medical staff is simply not workable.  Beyond this highway safety concern, I believe the medical literature is clear that a certain percentage of people under the age of 25 develop permanent mental impairment due to smoking marijuana.  It doesn't adversely affect everyone, but it can do nasty things to brains that are still in the process of developing.","The single most effective thing that the State of Maryland could do to protect the Bay would be to require Exelon to dredge the pool behind the Conowingo Dam to a depth that would ensure that the polluted sediment behind the Dam would not be picked up during a high water event and transported over the Dam and into the Bay.  The dredging would not need to take the pool down to the original bottom of the Susquehanna River, only to the depth that in a period of flooding would result in flowing water at that depth to be moving so slowly that it would not be capable of picking up and moving the sediment.  I am very proud that my rating from the Maryland League of Conservation Voters is 86%.  This reflects the fact that over the course of the past four years, I have voted in favor of environmental bills most of the time.  My votes reflect that I support restoring the oyster bars, support preventing nitrogen runoff into the Bay, support cleaning up the Bay's tributary creeks and streams and support banning chemicals that could adversely impact the Bay.  If I am elected, I expect to continue to support measures to save the Bay.","During the 2017 Session of the General Assembly, I worked hard to create a commission to make sure that the Affordable Care Act in Maryland would not collapse and leave over 150,000 Maryland citizens without health insurance.  In light of my efforts, the Speaker of the House appointed me as the lone Republican legislator on the Maryland Health Insurance Protection Commission.  We worked all summer and fall last year and then worked even more intensively this winter in order to produce the Protect Maryland Health Care Act of 2018.  Even though I was one of only three Republican Delegates to support the final bill, the effort to develop this essential legislation  was a bi-partisan effort, and Governor Hogan is prepared to sign the enrolled bill.  My principal contribution to the enacted bill was to make sure that it does not include a financial penalty for a family that does not choose to enroll in one of the offered health plans.  I ascertained that for such a penalty to succeed in inducing families to enroll, the penalty would have to be between $9,000 and $12,000 per year for a family of four.  A penalty in this amount would be unthinkable, so I successfully got the penalty provision eliminated from consideration.","During this session, we are set to consider a very significant crime bill authored by Senator Bobby Zirkin.  It contains quite a few provisions urged by Governor Hogan but includes other provisions designed to give state prosecutors a greater ability to put violent offenders behind bars for longer periods.  Most importantly, the bill greatly increases penalties for second time violent offenders.  The point is both to deter lawless conduct that destroys communities and to lock up repeat violent offenders so they can no longer menace the people in their neighborhoods because they will be behind bars for many more years than at present.  I expect to vote in favor of this bill.    Two years ago, I was instrumental in drafting, vetting and enacting the Justice Reinvestment Act.  The Speaker appointed me to the Justice Reinvestment task force that worked long hours throughout the 2016 Session developing the bill, and then I served on the Conference Committee that worked late into the night just before ""Sine Die"" to compromise differences between the House bill and the Senate bill.  In fact, I was the one who proposed the final compromise of the most intractable differences between the two bills.  This legislation, which again had the full support of the Governor, effectuated dramatic and far-reaching reforms of Maryland's criminal justice system, particularly as it deals with non-violent (mostly drug-related) offenses.","Over the course of the past four years, I have done everything I could to foster an improved business climate in Maryland.  Indeed, my cumulative four year pro-business rating is 93%.  Unfortunately, despite my efforts, most of the bills affecting business that have been passed by the General Assembly have hurt Maryland businesses. On the other hand, Governor Hogan has run a very pro-business Administration which has helped Maryland businesses at least as much as the General Assembly has hurt them.  I introduced a bill to gradually reduce Maryland's high corporate income tax rate by 0.25% per year for the next nine years, so that at the end of this period, our 8.25% tax rate will be reduced to 6%, the same rate as in the adjoining State of Virginia.  If anyone wonders why virtually all of the national companies looking to establish operational facilities in the greater D. C. area choose Virginia instead of Maryland, a comparison between Maryland's 8.25% tax rate with Virginia's 6% tax rate would be a good place to start.  Of course, my bill was given short shrift by the General Assembly.  As a result, Maryland has no choice but to offer Amazon a massive bribe to induce the company to locate its satellite facility in Maryland.","Absolutely.  Each year, Governor Hogan has proposed taking Maryland's redistricting process out of politics and consigning it to a non-partisan group with the direction that the group draw logical district lines which observe natural boundaries and county lines whenever possible.  The Governor's proposal has been voted down by solid, partisan Democratic majorities.  I have supported the Governor's proposal each time it has come up for a vote.  Former Governor Martin O'Malley has admitted that the lines that he drew after the 2010 census were partisan and designed to create more Democrat seats.  As a consequence, Maryland has been held up to national ridicule as the poster child for irresponsible partisan behavior.  This is not the sort of reputation that serves Maryland well.  If I should be elected to the State Senate this year, I will do everything that I can to enact legislation that will take the redistricting decision out of partisan politics.  Quite simply, this is the right thing to do, and it is what our constituents want.","In my experience, the Baltimore County Police Department is held in the highest regard by the residents of Baltimore County.  State's Attorney Scott Shellenberger works very effectively with the Police Department to identify any issues of police misconduct and has pioneered the use of body cameras to record encounters with members of the public.  If a member of the Police Department has transgressed, it is Scott's policy to discuss the incident with the officer, not with a view towards discipline, but with a goal of educating the officer so the problem does not recur.  I attend innumerable neighborhood and community meetings annually.  It is not unusual for such meetings to start with a presentation by a representative of the Baltimore County Police Department about recent crimes in the affected neighborhood.  The presentation is followed by an interactive question and answer period.  Not once in four years have I felt that, upon the conclusion of the presentation, there is a feeling of resentment or antagonism against the officer.  In short, based upon my experience, the Maryland Law Enforcement Officer's Bill of Rights as well as other laws whose purpose is to restrain unacceptable practices by those who holds public safety jobs are on target and effective.","As a member of the House Health and Government Operations Committee, the opioid issue has been the primary focus of my attention throughout my four year term.  Led by my committee and consistently supported by Governor Hogan, the General Assembly has passed quite a few bills to deal with all aspects of this problem.  We have required all of our public schools, from elementary years to high school years, to provide robust education about the dangers of drugs in general and opioids in particular.  We have made the overdose antidote, Naloxone, freely available and required widespread training in how to use it.  We have instituted a statewide prescription drug monitoring system that will track every single prescription for opioids and enable the State to shut down the ""pill mills"". We have set up a statewide crisis hotline and have started to set up crisis treatment centers to deal with overdoses.  We have expanded drug courts.  One piece of legislation that I was instrumental in passing, the Justice Reinvestment Act, establishes a policy of breaking drug offenders of their habit, providing them mental health counseling as needed and then getting them out of prison into paying jobs in order to try to reintroduce them to society as productive citizens.","Maryland is doing a great deal to address income inequality.  Baltimore City and some of the remote rural counties have the greatest level of income inequality in the State.  Baltimore City receives from the State. $1.02 for every $1.00 in taxes that its taxpayers send to the State.  By contrast, Baltimore County only receives from the State only $.28 for every $1.00 in taxes that its taxpayers send to the State.  Montgomery County receives back even less than Baltimore County.  Income inequality is addressed in so many other ways as well.  The school funding formulas are skewed in favor of less wealthy jurisdictions, and the Kirwan Commission is recommending an adjustment to the current formulas in order to provide even greater advantages to the City.  The Baltimore Link mass transit system is generally routed so as to serve Baltimore City residents rather than residents in the surrounding counties.    Income inequality between Baltimore City and Baltimore County are in part attributable to the fact that businesses have either left the City or are not locating there in the first place due to the City's high crime rate and its anti-business policies.  The best way for the City to reduce income inequality would be for the City to seriously work at attracting to the City the sort of businesses that would offer City residents good career opportunities.  Trying to attract Amazon to Port Covington was a good, if unsuccessful, start, but the City needs to be aggressively pursuing much smaller companies.","I am not aware that there are problems with the State's Public Information Act and open meetings laws, but let me speak about the way Annapolis is run.  My committee (the House Health and Government Operations Committee) is quite open and transparent.  All of our bill hearings are announced in advance and easily available to the public on the General Assembly website.  Further, our hearing are all captured on tape and can be viewed at any time, again through the General Assembly's website.  By contrast the sessions of the House of Delegates are not taped so they can be viewed.  There is audio tape of our floor sessions, but unless a constituent is familiar with the individual voices of the Delegates, he would be hard pressed to figure out who is talking.  Until this point, the meetings of the Board of Public Works at which school construction issues are addressed and decisions about the expenditure of hundreds of millions of dollars of State money are made have been taped and thus are available for public viewing.  From this point on, however, thanks to legislation passed over the Governor's veto by partisan Democratic majorities in both houses of the General Assembly, these critical decisions will be made from now on by nine unknown people who are not answerable to the voters. This ill-considered legislation will make Maryland's government more distant and more opaque.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

,YES,state-senate,37,Holly Wright,Wright,,Saint Michaels,Democratic,Talbot County,http://hollywrightforsenate.com,,,,"Wells College, BA Columbia University, EdD","20+ years experience in public health, including at the state and regional level; staff to senior management at Empire Blue Cross/Blue Shield and Montefiore Medical Center; directed a nursing home quality assurance program for 40 facilities in Bronx NY; on-call chaplain at hospital in Easton, Regional Cancer Center, New Hope Jail Ministry at Talbot County Detention Center.","In order for Maryland to continue to maintain its leadership in educational achievement for its students, updating the funding formula for state support for k-12 education to devote more resources to at risk youth, those living in poverty and special education students. is important.  I am in favor of early childhood education programs for 4 year olds based on ability to pay and leadership development program that strengthens management and leadership at all levels.  Reforms should be supported through both state and county funding sources.","This past legislative session was notable for increased funding for 4.4% increase in the MTA's operating budget for each of the next 3 years starting in 2019 and a capital infusion of $29 million for the Baltimore subway or other MTA systems, which includes the MARC system and commuter buses.  In addition, Maryland's share of $167 million is to be awarded to the Washington Area Metropolitan Transit Authority which operates the Washington Metro.  Of primary importance to rural areas of the state was the 2010 reduction by 90% of highway user revenues for most jurisdictions.  The past two legislative sessions have produced improvements providing increased local transportation aid.  I am in favor of continued progress in restoration of the highway user revenues.","With marijuana is now available for medical purposes and its use largely decriminalized, an estimated majority of Marylanders may support the legalization of recreational marijuana.  There is no way under the Maryland constitution currently to directly propose legislation through a ballot initiative.   I would be in favor of a constitutional amendment that would provide the mechanism for a ballot initiative on legalization.","Many and complex issues surround the health of the Bay.  We need to prioritize funding for public sector natural resource conservation, protection, research and management programs. A major concern with regard to the continued progress in Bay restoration and other aspects of environmental protection is the undermining of the mission and funding for the Environmental Protection Agency.  That notwithstanding, the omnibus appropriations bill passed recently reversed the announced defunding of the Chesapeake Bay Program, restoring $73 million.  Agriculture, oysters and crabs, and changing land use issues challenge progress forward to achieve the Chesapeake Clean Water Blueprint.  Among priorities should be financial support for cover crops and drainage control structures for Shore farmers to use in a coordinated way to decrease the concentration of nitrogen. By strengthening the forest conservation act and requiring replacement of priority forests, the net loss of forest land to development can be reversed which will further sustain and improve air and water quality.","The stabilization of Maryland's Affordable Care Act through the recent actions during the 2018 legislative session to establish and fund a reinsurance pool was an important step.  This has been accomplished through a tax on all health insurers and will moderate increases to insurance rates on the exchange.  Beyond this temporary fix to stabilize the individual market place, I support a public option while working on a system for health care for all in the longer term.  I believe adding the public option is a necessary transitional step to any system for universal coverage. Establishing a state level commission to control prescription drug prices, like the hospital rate setting commission, is essential to assuring access to this important component of health care.","It is a hopeful sign that so far in 2018, non-fatal shootings, homicides and other violent crimes are 30% below that of this period in 2017 and that groups like Baltimore Ceasefire, Safe Streets and the No Boundaries Coalition are working hard to continue to address the problem of Baltimore's violent crime.  The interconnection of social and economic forces are at the root of this human tragedy.  The Justice Reinvestment Act that increases the chances nonviolent offenders to reintegrate into the community and the legislation during the last session to allows those who have committed certain felonies to have their records expunged after 15 years goes in the right direction but not far enough.  Moving ex-offenders into purposeful roles in the community is the most valuable investment the state can make.","Maryland has a strong business climate, but we can do better.  According to a recent CNBC analysis, Maryland  ranks 4th in technology and innovation and our overall economy ranks 7th in the nation.  We need to leverage these strengths by retaining more of the startups that hatch in Maryland and move elsewhere.  We also need to make staying and expanding in Maryland less costly for existing and potential new businesses.  Maryland ranks near the bottom of all states in the cost of doing business here, and that, quite frankly, is hurting us and means that there are less jobs in the state for Maryland families than there could or should be.  The state legislature showed that it believes that Maryland families deserve dignity by overriding Larry Hogan's veto of legislation allowing five full days of paid sick leave a year.  This is a good start in fostering more family-supporting jobs.  But so too is attracting and retaining any jobs that pay more than minimum wage.  With our high levels of innovation and technology in the state, we could and should become a clean tech center, generating many high-paying jobs.  Quite simply, the more high paying jobs we can attract and retain, the better for Maryland families.","The Maryland Redistricting Reform Commission recommended a nine-member commission three each from the Republican and Democratic parties and three non-aligned citizens.  States that have moved toward similar entities to carryout redistricting include Iowa, Washington, Arizona, California, New Jersey and Rhode Island.  Whatever entity is charged with redistricting,  I am in favor of districts that are compact and contiguous, and reflect more nearly county and municipal boundaries rather than voter registration, previous election results and office holder's addresses.  According to a February Goucher College poll, over 70% of Maryland residents agree.","The 1974 Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights was meant to address a particular circumstance in which police officers' rights were not being protected as they should be.  Today where public trust, essential to the effective and efficient conduct of law enforcement, is at issue,  a new balance must be struck.  Procedures to accommodate the need for transparency are required so that members of the public are able to follow investigations into possible wrong doing and have confidence in the system.","Addiction to opioids, like other substance use disorders, requires a continuum of services including  prevention, inpatient detox, inpatient rehabilitation, outpatient therapy and medication assisted treatment, supportive housing and recovery resource centers.  Recovery resource centers, with 12-step fellowships, education and training programs, and a sober social setting has been shown to help individuals develop and maintain  a healthy lifestyle  which supports  recovery.   A separate and secure source of funding should be established for this important component of recovery.","Reforms in the state funding of k-12 education and universal pre-kindergarten can help support those in at risk communities to get a better start in school to address issues of multi-generational poverty. As the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education has recommended, the state should provide more funding for pre-kindergarten with no charge for four year olds from families at or below 300% of the federal poverty level while higher income families would pay a portion of the cost.  Income inequality could also be addressed through an increase in the minimum wage,  with more gradual rate increases for companies with less than 50 employees.  The Consumer Price Index, should used to keep the rate of increase in keeping with the conditions of the economy.",More effective procedures for public notice of permitting processes should be required so that on major development or infrastructure projects the public is aware from the beginning.,"Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

I am committed to Funding it.,"Yes but we need seperate streams of funding so they aren't always competing. No we do not presently have the funding to adequately meet ou transportation needs. Baltimore is not adequately served. I feel an above ground system woud be more economical, coud be achieved much faster and wouldbetter serve Baltimore. The old trolley routes would cover the city well.",I think we should phase it in as was done in Washington and Oregon. Now that the dispenseries and growers are coming on line it will be much simpler.,"We have to eep pressure on Washington but we need to continue our efforts to protect the streams and rivers that feed the Bay, strenghten our relationshps with the other jurisdictions that are in the Bay watershead and bac fill funding where we can.",We should press forward with efforts for universal single payer health insurance. Again we shoul back fill where we can. We also needto work to hold down costs on drugs.,"I think we are trying to do that but the answer is not police alone. We need to support better education and job training, efforts to bring jobs to Baltimore and affordable housing. Baltimore used to be the economic engine of Md. We need to support efforts to bring it back to self sufficiency at a minimum.",Md.'s business climate is not as bad as has been portrayed.  We need to promote not denegrate our business climate. Review and elimination of duplicative regulations should continue. An educated workforce is one of ourgreatest attributes. We need to strengthen our efforts to bring that attribute to the minority communities and we need to partner our efforts with the bussiness community.,"Yes, but it should be done Nation wide. Hopefully in reviewing the cases before it the Supreme Court will do that. MD is not an Island. When we give up seats and other states don't it weakens our National position.",No! It should be reviewed by a balanced board insuring everyone'e rights and protection. We must support our polce but wemust also protect our citizenry. There are too many cases accross the country of force being used unnecessarily particulary with minorities. We can do better for all.,We need a comprehensive strategy to address this problem. We shoud start with doctors who over prescribe. we need to put more emphasis on treatment and trseating this as an addiction rather than a crime. If we were to do that we could get ridof the street sales of heroin which would stopa huge portion of the deaths.,Weshould start with equal pay for equal work.  We also need a livable wage as opposedto a minimum wage. We need more and better jobs and the training to go with them. Their are thousands of existing good jobs available in the trades without qualified people to take them. It would also help if we gave more respect to the trades. Everyone can't or doesn't want to go to college.,I think in general they are adequate but am always willing to consider ideas for improvements.,"Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

Georgetown University Law Center,Member of the House of Delegates 1998-2006 Member of the State Senate 2006 - Present Attorney and Partner at Zirkin and Schmerling Law,"I absolutely support the findings of the Commission and am fully committed to the K-12 funding reforms.  This past Session, we maintained our commitment to public schools by investing over $6. 5 billion dollars in K-12 education, the largest commitment in history.  Local schools gain an increase of almost 3% in funding compared to FY18.  We fully funded all Thornton formulas and the GCEI, ad we funded an additional $11.4 million to fund the interim recommendations of the Kirwan Commission.   In addition to the budget items, the Legislature moved to guarantee funding would be available for future funding reforms by insuring that money from casino revenue is placed into a ""lockbox.""  It is estimated that $500 million more would be allocated for education funding once the lockbox is fully implemented following a 4-year phase-in. $400 million per year in school construction funding was made as a new baseline for state budgeting under legislation passed this Session.  The bill also creates a new $10m fund for projects related to improving school security, and assists the development of public-private partnerships for schools construction, largely developed on local jurisdictions' priorities. The legislation requires an assessment of school facilities to create a ""common language"" around facility needs so as to prioritize projects on their merits. In its totality, we insured that when reforms are handed down from the Commission, Maryland will be prepared to fully implement those recommendations, and I am in strong support of them.  As I have been for 20 years.","This year's capital budget includes over $2.6 billion of transportation spending. Thousands of Maryland residents rely on Metro to travel around the DC metro area, but unfortunately Metro in both the DC and Baltimore regions has been historically underfunded.  This Session, we passed legislation mandating an annual $167 million appropriation from the Transportation Trust Fund to pay for a cost-sharing formula shared between Maryland, Virginia, and D.C.  The money will be used for capital investments for the Metro system. In addition, the legislation also requires an allocation of an extra $178 million over three years to the Maryland Transit Administration for their operation of the subway in Baltimore, which was recently closed for a month for emergency repairs. Following the economic crisis in 2008 Maryland cut back on payments from the Transportation Trust Fund to local government. This Session, we reversed those cuts.  In FY 2019 a total of $178.1 million will be paid to local governments and by FY 2023 those payments will equal $264.7 million. It is always a challenging balance between funding our roads and mass transit but it is obviously critical to do both.  Several years ago, I supported revenue enhancement for the purpose of funding our transportation needs and that has helped, but we still fall short.  Mass transit is critical, albeit expensive infrastructure that must be funded alongside roads.  As we move forward, I believe that mass transit needs additional funding to create a better balance with other transportation infrastructure.","In my 20 years in the Maryland General Assembly, I have seen the historic change in our approach to marijuana.  I was a sponsor of medical marijuana which is finally coming on-line, bringing needed medications for individuals with cancer, glaucoma, AIDS, and other debilitating ailments.  Along with then-Senator Jamie Raskin, I was proud to be part of the committee that ironed out details of that legislation.  It has not been smooth, but we seem to finally be there. Several years ago, I sponsored successful legislation to decriminalize small amounts of marijuana.  And I led the effort for expungement of past marijuana convictions.  It is my strong opinion that we have historically wasted vast law enforcement resources on a failed approach to marijuana.  And the disproportionate effect of criminalization on minorities is undeniable.  I was proud to lead this bipartisan and successful effort to reform our laws.   This past Session, I sponsored additional legislation to further decriminalization efforts by increasing ""de minimus"" amounts and to begin to reform ""PWID' laws.  Those efforts were successful in the Senate butfailed in the House. I personally believe that adults should be permitted to recreationally use marijuana, as long as use does not affect others.  For example, smoking in public and around children should not be permitted, and penalties for driving under the influence should be severe.  But I believe that consenting adults should have the choice, and that a legal structure is far better than drug dealers and crime associated with the drug trade.","Protecting our environment is critically important to me.  We have made great progress over my time in office, particularly in the area of renewable energy, but we have a long way to go.  I am excited to be endorsed by the Sierra Club and the League of Conservation Voters for my commitment to the environment. Last session, I was proud to be the lead sponsor of legislation making Maryland the 3rd State to ban fracking, a dangerous process for gas extraction. This session, I introduced legislation for a Constitutional Amendment ensuring a clean environment for Marylanders. While many states have adopted Constitutional Amendments for the environment, Maryland has yet to take that step. I plan to continue that effort.  This Session I was proud to support legislation aimed to deter offshore drilling off of our Coast. The bill recognizes offshore drilling as an extremely hazardous activity and would hold individuals engaged in offshore drilling strictly liable for all damages caused by a spill. President Trump announced in 2017 that he would withdraw the United States from the Paris Climate Accords, a horrible decision.  Following that announcement, states announced that they would continuethe framework of the Paris Accords.  Legislation passed this year assures Maryland's commitment. Additionally, Maryland has been a member of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), a ""cap-and-trade"" program relating to climate change.  Legislation passed this year continues that involvement. For 20 years, I have been a staunch advocate of the environment and that commitment has never wavered.","Providing high quality and affordable healthcare is critical and the General Assembly has been active in this area, particularly in the wake of President Trump's undermining of the Affordable Care Act. This Session we passed a 2.75% tax on the premiums that health insurers sell in Maryland next year - the same tax that they were exempted from paying this year by the Federal government. This new temporary tax will create a Reinsurance program, which will help cover the most expensive claims from people insured on the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange. The state will also seek federal funds to extend the reinsurance plan, and charges the Maryland Health Insurance Coverage Protection Commission with studying the long-term stability of the state's insurance market and the possibility of requiring all Marylanders to buy health insurance as a way to replace the federal ""individual mandate"" that expires in 2019.  We will need vigilance in this area as drastic changes may come down from Washington. We must also work in a broad area of healthcare coverage, including affordability of prescription drug coverage. This Session, we passed legislation insuring pharmacy benefits managers cannot prohibit a pharmacist from assisting patients in more affordable prescription drug coverage. This was the latest in a series of bills passed over the last term on prescription drug coverage, an area that also requires constant vigilance. As healthcare continues to become more expensive, we have to continue to find new ways to provide affordable and quality access to Marylanders.","343 murders and over 600 non-fatal shootings in 2017.  With Baltimore declared the most dangerous city in the nation, it is imperative that leaders at all levels take significant action. In the last two years, the Justice Reinvestment Act focused on non-violent offenders and helping to divert addicts out of the criminal justice system and into treatment options. This Session we focused on the specific issue of repeat violent offenders and a holistic approach to crime in Baltimore. The number of individuals committing violent acts in Baltimore is relatively low, but accountability is unfortunately not severe. This Session, a package of bills passed the General Assembly, including enhanced penalties for repeat violent offenders, accountability for gun violence, funding for important programs such as Safe Streets, LEAD, and Witness Relocation, penalties for witness intimidation, and expungement opportunities.  The package also included a gang task force, penalties for Fentanyl dealers, and resources to combat gun trafficking.  This crime package was important and long overdue. Being smart on crime means holding violent offenders accountable while treating addiction and mental health issues in the treatment system.  Citizens in Baltimore and across our State demand real action to make sure that repeat violent offenders are held accountable for the carnage and terror that they create and that there are long term solutions to violence.  We produced such a package of legislation this session. So goes Baltimore, so goes the State.  And so we all have a shared commitment and a shared responsibility to our City.","Maryland's business climate is a work in progress and there have been greater strides in recent years.  Creating a better business climate is obviously essential to job creation and retention, but it cannot be accomplished at the expense of important regulations in the areas of environmental protection and worker safety. Recent legislation such as paid sick leave and new ideas of increasing the minimum wage will certainly assist individuals to work at a decent wage and raise a family.  With any such legislation, we have to be careful not to adversely affect our small businesses in a way that might cause job loss.  For example, the small business tax cut passed to ameliorate the effects of paid sick leave was an excellent idea.  As I have always said, the devil is in the details of this legislation. To continue to maintain and enhance our business climate, factors such as an educated and healthy workforce are critical.  This is why we continue to fully fund K-12 and higher education and search for new ways to provide affordable and quality healthcare and create better public safety.  In addition, it is time for the state to consider reforming state business taxes, particularly for small business and a tax credit for angel investors.",Yes.,"It is critical for public safety that there is mutual trust and support between law enforcement and the communities that they serve.  Over the last few years, we have implemented reforms designed to enhance the relationship.  Unfortunately, events such as the Baltimore gun task force have interrupted those efforts.  Specifically, in 2016, as the result of a task force chaired by then-Senator Catherine Pugh, legislation was passed that included the following: eliminating the need for notarization of complaints, complaints may come from individuals with first-hand knowledge, increased statute of limitations for filing complaints, shortened period for obtaining counsel, open hearings, and the establishment of alternative dispute resolutions to complaints. The bill also established a Community Program Fund to assist local law enforcement agencies in establishing community law enforcement programs and violence intervention programs and established whistleblower protections.    LEOBR serves an important role in creating a real process to handle citizen complaints and maintain due process for law enforcement.  There are certainly areas for possible continuing reform within LEOBR such as insuring open meetings for citizen review boards and permitting citizen participation on those boards that do not currently allow for participation.","Opioid related deaths continue to be at record levels in Maryland and across the nation.  Many individuals who get addicted to heroin started on prescription painkillers. And despite improvement, treatment options continue to be underfunded.  The Legislature has passed countless bills over the last term with the problem continuing to worsen.  Clearly, we need to fully fund treatment options both inside the corrections facilities and outside.  We made strides in that direction in the Justice Reinvestment Act but 8-507 treatment beds need to be fully funded and treatment must be available on demand. Our criminal justice laws need to play a part as well, by insuring that addicts are diverted from the criminal justice system into the treatment system, while volume dealers, kingpins, and dealers using children in their distribution chains are held fully accountable. We have to continue to insure that painkillers are not oversubscribed and that the 'pill mills' are shut down and individuals making profits from these operations are held criminally accountable.  It will be interesting to research the interplay of medical cannabis with this crisis as patients are diverted from opioids for pain treatment. There is no easy answer to this epidemic, but we will continue to be vigilant in searching for new and creative ways to get people out of addiction and out of danger from overdose and assist in obtaining the treatment that they need.","Maryland already has a progressive tax system.  The most effective way to raise individuals out of poverty is to provide a great education, access to affordable healthcare, and job opportunities.  Only in that way can there be a long term solution to income inequality.  Those goals are accomplished in a variety of ways as discussed previously.","To my knowledge, they do.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?
