Chairman of Procurement Council for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce","I continue to be a strong supporter of the work of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence (The Kirwan Commission). It is building on the visionary work of the Commission on Education Finance Equity and Excellence (The Thornton Commission). I support the 9 drivers or building blocks on which the Commission's recommendations are based. The Kirwan Commission, like the Thornton Commission, has broad support across the state across party, race, and geography, and has the potential, with proper innovation, accountability and funding, to move Maryland back to number one in national educational performance rankings. The task before us is urgent and we must move decisively to provide high quality education for the approximately 900,000 public school students in our 24 school systems. We must address the adequacy funding gap that is impacting 20 of 24 of our school districts. Funding for public education has been relatively flat since 2009, notwithstanding the Thornton Formula. An important ingredient in achieving this objective is state and local leadership that can build the political consensus that will be required to gain passage of the Commission's recommendations. I will work to ensure that there is equal access to high quality programs and services, adequate and equitable funding for public education with innovation and strict and systemic accountability. I take seriously the requirement of the Maryland Constitution that: ""The General Assembly…shall by Law establish throughout the State a thorough and efficient System of Free Public Schools; and shall provide by taxation, or otherwise, for their maintenance.","Transportation is essential to ensuring opportunity for the working poor (BaltimoreLink) and making sure that our State is prepared for future economic growth.  The State has nearly a $4 Billion transportation budget.  The updated Consolidated Transportation Plan (CTP) starting in FY18 focuses on structurally deficient bridges.  We need a data-driven process however to help the State prioritize funding for projects that will yield the greatest public benefit.  Baltimore has specific needs for example around improving the Howard Street Bridge.  The success of this project impacts the future prospects of the Baltimore Port - it's directly related to the port's capacity for accommodating stacked shipping containers.  If the Port can't accommodate these shipping containers, then business opportunities will go elsewhere.  We are fortunate in Maryland to have one of the lowest rates of structurally deficient bridges.  Only 67 out nearly 2,600 bridges are deemed deficient in Maryland.   By statue Baltimore receives about 80 percent of Highway User Revenue (HUR) and an additional $5 Million for capital needs.  It's not quite enough to fully update MTA's fleet of buses and light rail.  We need an infrastructure bill, one that combines federal and state resources, to help address regional transit and road needs.  The State received a $10 Million TIGER grant from the US Department of Transportation to support BaltimoreLink – it's a start and an example of a promising state-federal partnership.","I support the further study of this issue.  We need ""smart-on-crime"" approaches that pushes back on the failed, draconian war on drugs approach that have locked away too many citizens.","I would need to do further research on this issue, but I do value the restoration of the Chesapeake Bay. It's a staple part of Maryland, and we cannot continue to allow the marine life to suffer as it has.",We should continue to look at ways to support the establishment of reinsurance pools to help control costs for insurers and to stabilize the insurance market place.,"I believe the state first needs to understand the history of Baltimore. A task force should do a 30+ year historical assessment of violent crime (or use those already done by sociologists and other social science PhD's as Baltimore has been a frequent case study), focusing on the communities most affected by violent crime and understanding the sources and underlying causes.  Once assessed, there needs to be a focus on key target areas of economic investment and holistic community outreach/development through some of the following channels: school investment, housing developments,  and especially counseling/mental health centers as many individuals involved in violent crime have suffered from their own forms of trauma that went unnoticed and unassisted or are coming from situations that most individuals cannot comprehend.  I believe violent crime is a symptom of a much greater issue. I will work to make sure that the state helps usher in an era of smart on crime approaches that invest in schools, in economically distressed communities, and that provides an evidenced-based blueprint for support offenders.  I will work at the state level to help find a better way for formerly incarcerated Baltimore citizens to lead a productive, economic life after prison as well to decrease recidivism which also leads to crime as many individuals are barred from all aspects of civilian life after incarceration.","Overall, a strong business climate right now. I believe from surveys and research I've been able to look at, our economy is well positioned moving forward into the future. I believe we need to do continual increases in technology and STEM based jobs and continue to focus on growing our cyber security as the leader of it in the nation.  I also believe, we need to look at and embrace the minimum wage increases to a living wage. We also need to invest in entrepreneurs around the entire state.","Yes.  We have one of the most gerrymandered districts in the United States in Maryland's Congressional Third District. I support the creation of a non-partisan or equally bi-partisan, body to draw the legislative and congressional district maps after each census if they are first fully aware of how the drawing of legislative and district maps have been used historically to gerrymander communities of color and other marginalized groups and vow against this practice. I believe prior to the legislative maps being finalized that they should even be brought before a non-partisan, diverse body of constituents, to ensure that the redistricting is fair to those most vulnerable to unfair redistricting practices. There should be community representatives that are part of this approval system to ensure voices are heard and thorough vetting of all possible ways to map out territories.","I believe that the Officers Bill of Rights needs to be reviewed thoroughly because it is a broad bill, as we have to maintain accountability of those that are called to serve the community are transparent in their interactions with the community they are serving. We need clear practices of accountability to ensure all actions of law enforcement are being reviewed to ensure they are living up to their commitment to serve the public, especially in  communities of color.  It does need to be changed to ensure people are both protected, but more importantly, know that the police have their best interest at heart. We have to rebuild trust that has been broken for decades due to a lack of transparency, swift communication, care, and compassion. We have to ensure that the law protects the people as much as it protects officers. These issues are too important to continue to fall by the way-side.",We need to understand how this became a crisis and remind ourselves that people don't want to be addicted to opioids as we work this out.,"As the next state Senator from the 23rd District, I will be a strong supporter of initiatives that are designed to remove all barriers to income equality between men and women. Unequal pay based on gender affects not only the woman, but their families and the communities in which they live. It affects their quality of life during the working period and retirement. I support the Equal Pay Act (EPA), which requires that men and women in the same workplace be given equal pay for equal work. I support the administrative and judicial remedies that extend from the Act and empower individuals harmed by unequal pay. I will support the aggressive enforcement of Title VII, which makes it illegal to discriminate based on sex in pay and benefits. I will also be a strong voice for the enforcement of non-discrimination provisions of Title VII, the ADEA, and the ADA, which prohibit compensation discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, or disability. The enforcement initiatives must go hand-in-hand with programs that are designed to ensure that female students have access to equal high quality professional and vocational education and training in diverse fields that lead to highly compensated employment positions. I am pleased to see the sea change that is occurring in our culture (the Me-Too movement) that is helping empower women in all segments of our society, especially in the workplace involving the integrity of working environment.",It's important to review the fees charged particularly how we handle public longitudinal data systems center.

I was a third of the way into an MBA in Accounting when 9/11 happened and I joined the Navy. I graduated in top of my class at Officer Candadidate School, then went through flight school and earned my wings as a Naval Flight Officer. Once in the fleet, I received graduate level training at the Airborne Mission Commander Course in Fallon, NV, and at the School of Aviation Safety in Pensacola, FL.","I am a Certifed QuickBooks ProAdvisor and owner of a full-service business bookkeeping and consulting business.

After entering the Navy Reserve, I started my own business helping small businesses use QuickBooks to make their digital bookkeeping match reality. I am also on the board of several nonprofits - March On, March On Maryland, Maryland NORML, and The Milky Way Foundation.","The Kirwan Commission produced a report that is an excellent guide to begin the process of improving our state education system. We need to pay our teachers, and we need to address the education gap in Maryland. We can start by ensuring that casino revenue be set aside in a special fund for education and fulfill the promise to voters.  I intend to help get the referendum passed in November; we need to send a message from the ballot box to our elected officials that education is our priority.  We need to continue to build awareness about it and make sure people vote on it in November.","Maryland's transportation system is not adequately serving the needs of our growing communities. We need to improve our transit system to ensure that more Marylanders have access to efficient public transportation. Investing in better, cleaner mass transit will lessen the environmental impact of commuters on our state's ecosystem.","64% of Maryland voters support legalization. It's time to listen to the people. I supported the bill in the 2018 legislative session to put legalization on the ballot as a referendum, because many legislators no longer truly represent the people, so it's time for the people to speak on the issue directly and be heard.  And in states with legal marijuana, opioid overdoses are reduced by 25%.",We should immediately take steps to implement the Chesapeake Bay Program at a state level.  We need to track Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL)  and implement Watershed Implementation Plans (WIP). Then we need to fund the programs that will cover the gap.,"I support the development of a universal healthcare system for Marylanders. We can look at a system that we are already paying into as part of the solution. Tricare is the military healthcare system; most of our taxes go to  I believe that we as citizens should have the right to receive TriCare at cost from the Federal Government. The TriCare system is already prepared to provide care for all ages and genders, and I believe we have the right to access that care.","The best way to fighting crime is a multifaceted approach.  By giving people who have no good opportunities a lawful way to survive, would be most effective in the long term.  Revitalizing Baltimore manufacturing centers would provide good paying jobs.  ""Banning the Box""  to allow felons who have paid their debts to society to get a job and not return to an unlawful lifestyle out of need.  Youth outreach would be key, the State should increase funding for community centers, after school, and summer programs to give the youth of Baltimore a safe place to go away from the gangs, and be given the tools and values they need to live in society.   Gang outreach would need to be increased to try and get young men and women out of the gangs for good and become productive members of society.","Maryland is a favorable climate for medium and large corporations. Maryland's small business need a boost. We need to make sure that small businesses have access to the capital that they need to thrive. Maryland can foster cooperation between the banks, larger cooperations and small businesses. Developing agile corporate mentorship programs will boost small businesses will spark innovation and create jobs.  Additionally, we need to make banking laws more friendly towards small business.","Yes, this sounds very reasonable.",Law enforcement officers should be afforded the same protections as all citizens -- officers are NOT above the law. And our criminal justice system must be completely changed and dramatically simplified. We need to have more public visibility to what happens within our justice system. We can begin by including ordinary citizens in the disciplinary hearings.  Too frequently police are called to respond to non-criminal situations and the results can be tragic.  We are incarcerating disproportionate numbers of minorities and the current standards and systems we use including the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights may be contributing significantly to the current criminal justice crisis.,"We have to look at the root causes of addiction, which leads to a multi-pronged strategy: addressing the overprescribing of opioids, increase funding for beds, and finally, we need to practice empathy with logic. The opposite of addiction isn't sobriety; it's connection. I propose that we emulate military organizational structures like the Fleet and Family Support Center, which offers an abundance of services for military members and their families, including every kind of counseling. Bringing communities together, and neighboring ones","Developing educational systems that support workers that deliver value to our economy.  We need to develop more programs for addressing families in transition.  Too often a medical, legal or criminal event can leave a family unbalanced. We need to build back connection in our communities.    We need to implement technical training programs that teach small business innovation through agile industry-based partnerships. Through these programs we can build sustainable communities that are innovative, resilient, and ecologically sound.","Not really, if a developer can get as many waivers for meetings as they need from the local governments.  The open meeting law allows for ""administrative"" but the term is left intentionally vague.  Could issuing a waiver for a developer be considered an administrative function?  As such, is a public hearing needed?

Caretaker and service provider for Montgomery Pet Sitters.","Yes, my experience in citizen lobbying with the Maryland State Education Association has given to me in-depth knowledge that the proposed reforms provided by the Kirwan commission prioritize providing quality education and equity programs to the most vulnerable communities, where the quality of life is poorest, and increase the quality of education by providing more teachers and higher salaries for them as many are underpaid despite their union protections. The direct funding lockbox to the casino revenues as was originally promised in the 2012 referendum was a great start in this year's commitment to funding the education budget and reforms, and the same thing can be done for marijuana sales if the substance is legalized. Furthermore, reforms to reduce administrative overhead, which many teachers I know support since they say their aides are poorly trained and don't help much while their administrative offices continue to be non-responsive to their requests, can open more of the budget for the needed program funding.","In my opinion Maryland favors roads too much, and not even in the right way. My county of Montgomery alone blew a majority of its transportation budget building new county highways instead of maintaining the roads already in place, and now struggle to repave both the old and the new because of budget constraints while our public transit continues to decline in quality and, in effect, ridership. Because of the way it spent its transportation funds in the past, and the amount of needed upgrades to transportation infrastructure now, some things will have to be prioritized if we want to keep transit as public as possible. We'll have to make smart choices, starting with the most cost-effective improvements that cover the most people like BRT systems or MARC commuter expansions for areas of decentralized population.  As for the BaltimoreLink, mixed reviews have come through, though I suspect some of the negativity stems from years of general mistrust of the MTA to do its job properly. I would suggest taking the overhaul and transition process more seriously at the input of the public if it is to be effective, and keep in mind that the Red Line extension offered something that BaltimoreLink did not, more access to commuter routes to and from the DC and Virginia area. In conclusion, I'm leaning towards transit authority and administration could and probably should do more to accommodate Baltimore's transit needs.","Yes. There are at least three major benefits to the legalization of marijuana, both medical and recreational. First, it opens the door to a new industry, and more industries mean more tax revenue for funding state programs and projects, which is sorely needed as our state continues to face the prospects of cuts due to budget deficits. Second, it addressed criminal justice reform as there are quite a few people locked up for merely processing a single bag. With it legal, fewer Marylanders will have criminal records hampering their job opportunities and restricting their rights and access to helpful programs, and prisons will cost the taxpayers less since there will be fewer prisoners to contain. Third, it directly fights the opioid crisis by acting as a non-lethal substitute for painkillers. Medical studies have shown you literally cannot die by marijuana intoxication alone. In fact, you cannot technically overdose marijuana period because THC is not even absorbed through the brain stem like opioids are.","Maryland must make a commitment to achieving a zero-waste status to reduce pollution into the bay and lessen the costs of cleanup and recovery projects. The reforms necessary for this goal will have to include a transition to 100% renewable energy, modernizing the grid to be energy efficient, adoption of sustainable farming practices, expansion of food recovery networks, statewide bans of certain plastics and chemicals, container deposit legislation, implementation of rain collection and biowaste digester/composter projects, and mass-transit infrastructure building.  Everyone will have to do their part to make this a reality, but especially the industries themselves must be held accountable for environmental damage cost they shift to the taxpayers and workers. It'll be an uphill battle, but once achieved, it will give Maryland and its natural treasures not only environmental health, but economic resilience through self sustainability.","I would work with other state legislators and the governor to get the required waivers from the federal government to implement a state single-payer system, as outlined by gubernatorial candidate Ben Jealous in his 19 page healthcare plan. And while we're fighting, I would work to reinforce and expand what negotiating power the state already has with its waiver to implement the all-payer model, which fixes all hospital operations at a set rate so clients are not overcharged and overhead cost is reduced. If the viability of creating a state public option presents itself, if only to cover the uninsured as Rich Madaleno suggests, I would also not hesitate to support it, but would emphasize the fight for the state waivers or to pressure a national universal healthcare model must continue in full force.","Drug reform policy is a big must as trends have shown that the criminalization of abusive substances only leads to more severe actions and consequences on the whole, not to mention they're ineffective as their main targets, addicts, flat out ignore them as the fear of violence and incarceration does not overcome their cravings. And while I am in favor of background checks for gun reform, the sad truth is the highest number of fatalities that come from gun violence are contributed by the police. Despite the reforms pushed for since the infamous Freddie Gray shooting several years back, little has changed other than the BPD being caught in the act more often. Body cams catch evidence planting, unarmed shootings, various forms of corruption, yet accountability is rarely established on the whole. It's my belief that how the law enforcement system is structured in Baltimore drives many on the force to look for trouble and assume the worst. Arrest quotas, supplying the department with military-grade surplus, little to no enforcement of protocol, they're all incentives for the police to seek escalation of conflict in most situations. In addition to stopping these bad habits, public disclosure of official policies and procedure for the department as well as a requirement for deescalating training for all members of the force must be established to improve public relations and trust, because a lack of it creates tension on both sides.","Because of its proximity to numerous federal institutions on the south end, and wealth of universities and hospitals, Maryland holds a relatively stable climate with one of highest percentages of educated workforce in the nation, with room to hire in their major hubs. However, because many tech firms and superstores place their businesses in northern Virginia, there are dangerous arguments that Maryland should lower its corporate tax rate to be competitive with its neighbor. Combine that with the recent bidding war for Amazon's new HQ along with few distinctions of regulations between small and large companies, and I conclude a majority of Maryland leaders are too focused on getting outside business and their workforce to move in instead of building up local businesses run by already existing residents, a troubling recipe for economic unsustainability if you ask me. The state of Maryland can shift its focus to growing its own family businesses back home with a combination of equity programs for startups, tax and business regulatory reforms to accommodate companies with a smaller workforce, close corporate loopholes and enact stronger state union laws to protect workers from income inequality, and most importantly create a state jobs program for areas of need like infrastructure and environment to decrease unemployment numbers.","Of course. It saddens me to know that Democrats are willing to play just as underhanded as Republicans do if they get the chance to redraw the lines in their favor. It creates a misrepresentation of the general populace in government, and gives liberals no real legs to stand on when they complain how their conservative opponents rig the vote in their favor. I was swapped along with a good chunk of Montgomery county from district 8 to 6 just to defeat Republican incumbent Roscoe Bartlett, and all that did was raise partisan attacks across the state that limited thoughtful debate, which resulted in contributing to Larry Hogan's election as governor 2 years later when he championed an independent redistricting committee. On an additional note, I also point out that while the Maryland state constitution defines the parameters with how its legislative districts are drawn, it does not define congressional districts, giving the redistricters much more leeway on how to draw them. So I would not only support an independent redistricting committee, but work to amend our state constitution to have congressional district adhere to the same restrictions that legislative districts do as well.","While the LEOBoR's intent was to ensure the same due process for a police officer as a civilian, I believe the bill fails to take into account what resources and abilities an officer and his/her department have available to use that a civilian does not when accused of a criminal action. Moreover, there are provisions included that analysts conclude provide extra protections not covered by the original bill of rights, such as the purging of complaints and investigation records after a few years. Given the lack of accountability of Balitmore's police force, I would wager to say there is at least some grounds to accuse officers taking unfair advantage of these protections when possible. Changes should be made that hold an officer to be more responsible of the position he/she holds, at the very least the extra protections should be eschewed if an officer is really to hold equal footing to a civilian on investigation. I would also promote more civilian involvement in keeping investigations and reviews transparent by passing legislation to establish requirements that build more citizen review boards in areas that do not have any and strengthening the impartiality and abilities of existing ones.","As explained in questions 12 and 9, decriminalization of abusive substances and legalization of recreational marijuana both contribute to ending the opioid epidemic as less money is spent on incarceration and punishment of drug offenders as a result, and instead can be used to expand detox and rehabilitation clinics and programs. Another thing to do would be to regulate the prices and oversee the distribution of prescription medication statewide as it is within the state's power to do so. Many opioid additions start when clinics overprescribe opioid medication, and when the prescriptions become to costly to afford in poorer circles, people turn to more cheaper and unrefined opioids like heroin. Oversight committees  with citizen participation would ensure physicians don't overcharge or oversell opioid prescriptions just to increase their profit margin and inadvertently create addicts. Additionally, prioritizing preventive healthcare more would reduce the need of introducing painkillers like opioids to people in the first place. That means making sure there are enough doctors, nurses, and clinics available for regular visits, and implementing healthcare policies that make the cost of regular checkups affordable to everyone.","First, a statewide increase to the minimum wage must be implemented as living wage studies from various universities show the current minimum, $9.25, is actually at poverty levels for some families in Maryland when factoring in the costs of living. And while $15, over a period of adjustment to protect smaller businesses, would be an increase that covers most individuals across the state, current service and tax rates would still put quite a few households in the red. As such, a tax reform that indexes wages to lower the cost of affordable living for poorer communities, and at the same time closes corporate loopholes to ensure richer communities pay their fair share and make up lost revenue for funding the state's public programs must follow suit immediately with the wage increase if not at the same time. Additionally, many of those on the poorer end of the income spectrum have professions in labor. So increasing labor protections in the state(like a Workers Bill of Rights) will ensure workers have the benefits, fair scheduling, organization, and training/education to make their livelihoods more affordable and reasonably comfortable.","While the Public Information Act in Maryland has been through reforms for the first time in decades in 2015, many institutions continue to use outdated and overbloated administration and bureaucracy to invalidate and/or withhold indefinitely public requests to their records, one of the most prime examples being education budget and staff records. The Montgomery County Civic Federation has many members that have been attempting to get information from the county's board of education and superintendent in order to address administrative inaction to hold student abusers accountable, but have been stonewalled at every turn. The open meetings laws are not strong enough yet either, as local boards and councils can use the same tactics to say they were not given enough notice or claim information pertaining to the meeting's topic is either too sensitive to be discussed to the public body, or is an exemption that does not fall in any of the public body's functions. Bottom line, while the PIA and open meetings are supposed to bring transparency in principle, there's too much overhead and room for interpretation on the local levels of office to make it streamlined or enforceable. Administrative reforms to cut the bureaucracy and promote direct involvement of the citizen boards in access of information must be implemented, likely from the bottom up if we're to promote autonomy and active participation in communities. But the state can continue to tighten reforms to the PIA and open meeting laws in order to cultivate said climate.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

The prospect of a final report is the key reason that I am running for State Senate in District 34.  I want to be in the Senate to vote for the recommendations.  I would like to amend a couple of provisions that appear in the Preliminary Report if they show up in the final version. First,  specify that existing teachers would receive any benefit of implementation of the recommendations and that the same transitional provisions that apply to administrators would apply to teachers.  Second, eliminate an allowance for reduction in wages for student apprentices to sub-minimum wages.  I concur with the impetus to raise the status of educators and to establish professional pay in order to produce excellent education.","During the Hogan Administration transportation funding has been tilted too far toward roads. The endless construction on Route 22 through Aberdeen has been terribly disruptive for our community, an excessive response to the prospect of BRAC.  It appears that the State has adequate resources to meet its transportation needs if there is a return to emphasis on mass transit.        The General Assembly must restore the Red Line in negotiation with the Governor. The MARC service is a big improvement, but trains need to go to the extent of the northern stations in Aberdeen and Perryville more frequently.  Tourism can be even more profitable for MD if the service brings people from all stations into Baltimore and Washington on weekends.  The current 4:20 and 9:30 departures from Washington to Martin State Airport are too limiting.        The Baltimore Link certainly helps.  I know of District 34 people who commute to Annapolis, Owings Mills and Prince George's County.

It should continue to fill in where the  federal government fails temporarily until the country elects a more progressive administration.,"Fund better schools.  Develop a more comprehensive urban Extension Service to assist families with nutrition understanding, child care, health protocols, home care and maintenance and budgeting.  Maintain gun control initiatives that have been passed. Develop better rehabilitation in prisons.  Investigate the prison guard system.  Elected officials should use the bully pulpit to raise the moral climate in the community.  Establish norms that diminish police brutality. Put a lot more neighborhood emphasis on community mediation training.  Develop neighborhood crime watch programs more.","Maryland's business climate is lively.  The state can fund better schools and apply equity levers to improve education  throughout the state.  The state can raise the minimum wage and extend the reach of prevailing wage through its purchase of goods and services.  The state can foster further enhancement of the quality of life through the arts, cultural centers and academic hubs.  Satellites of existing cultural entities can extend these quality of life benefits to underserved areas.  Expanding recreational opportunities using our existing natural resources would help as I did when a county council member by opening up lost public landings for access to waterways and approaching the federal government under a joint use agreement with the Department of the Interior to open access to the Bay.  People who locate businesses are looking for a talented work force and indicia of a high quality of life.","No.  I support a body that includes executive branch and legislative leaders as well as diverse community representatives.  Any ""blue ribbon commission"" is not exempt from political considerations.  I would like to see more public hearings throughout the state to allow citizens to come forward to define communities of interest.","No.  The limitations on who may allege police brutality need to be opened up to more potential reporters. The availability of video and sound recordings should be accommodated. The 90 day statute of limitations for reporting is too short.  Other places in the same law have a one year interval.   References to reasonable hours are vague as are the references to alternate places for interrogation.  They undermine the heart of the restrictions.  The potential for the chief to increase a panel recommendation of penalty is dubious.  That needs study.  A single hearing officer instead of a panel is also questionable.  How many days until a hearing is no longer prompt - another vague provision. Several offices should be removed from the exempt list, such as a person who serves at the pleasure of the Police Commissioner of Baltimore City.","Extend family leave for birth and illness of children. Fund better schools.  Provide safe after school care. Change the high school daily schedule to start and end later, such as 9:00 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. Rehabilitate people who have been convicted of crimes.  Call for stricter review of doctors who overprescribe.  Train a broader segment of the population in emergency antidote procedures with the assistance of fire companies.  Develop senior center and teen center programming  links.",Raise the minimum wage.  Legislate an end to gender and minority bias in pay.   Fund better schools.  Strengthen community college offerings and provide more financial aid to students.  Change the culture that fosters fulltime work at the same time as fulltime student enrollment.  The dual load cannot be carried effectively.  Stop corporate giveaways with public money.,"No.  The present provision for a government to take up to 30 days to respond to a Public Information Request is too long.  The current loophole to allow local and municipal governments to have closed meetings concerning real estate purchase and sale is too broad.  It appears that there is too  much pressure to stifle debate and present a united front in public sessions concerning real estate to the detriment of the citizens.  Conference committees of the General Assembly are not subject to the Open Meetings Law so far as I know, and they should be.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

I supported and helped pass laws to create an Education Lock Box that will require Casino revenues to go only support, not supplant education funding and to have a new Interagency Commission on School Construction that will provide effective processes for obtaining increased school construction funding for local jurisdictions.  This session, I supported legislation to invest $6.5 billion in K-12 education and to fully fund the Geographic Cost of Education Index, while injecting $11.4 million to fund the Kirwan Commission's interim recommendations.","We need to increase funding for mass transit and the repair and improvement of infrastructures.   The funding and efforts to overhaul the bus system must produce  service that is efficient, reliable, safe and affordable.  We need to review and assess those efforts to ensure their goals are achieved.  We also need to support the Red Line, which will ensure individuals can get to work, home, school and other places,  connect vibrant communities, and reduce congestion and pollution.  This is an investment in our community that will enable people to have greater access to transportation, thereby creating more opportunities,  jobs, and state revenues while increasing the quality of their lives.","We have to review and learn from the experiences in states allowing legalization.  If the voters approve legalization via ballot, it should be regulated and taxed and the revenues used for funding education, health care, transportation, environment, other important priorities.","I have and will continue to support increased funding for the Chesapeake Bay Trust Fund,  protect oyster and crab populations, reduce agricultural, animal waste, and pollution runoff, and greenhouse gas emissions, increase Renewal Portfolio Standards, hold companies engaged in offshore oil and gas drilling  strictly liable for economic or environmental damage caused by any spill,  support septic and storm water management and accountability, forest conservation efforts, and applicable state agencies' enforcement activities and programs, require legislative approval before Maryland can withdraw from the US Climate Alliance or the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, and to allow the Attorney General to file suit on our behalf to protect the environment .","I have and will continue to support and pass legislation to increase access to affordable and quality health care and prescription drugs for all Marylanders.  To migitate recent Federal action, I helped pass laws to create Reinsurance program to cover the most costly claims by people on Maryland Health Benefit Exchange and to have the Maryland Insurance Coverage Protection Commission study the long term stability of the state's insurance market.  I also helped passed laws to increase rescription drug price transparency and Telehealth, which will save lives, increase early diagnosis, produce better outcomes, and provide service to underserved communities.","The Governor and General Assembly must continue to work to pass laws with the collaborative input and participation of community, civil rights, law enforcement, prosecutors, public defenders, other stakeholders on gun violence, witness protection, prosecution, sentencing, expungement, restorative justice, increased support for crime prevention programs and other measures to address violent crime.","I have supported and helped pass laws such as the Maryland Healthy Families Act (earned sick leave), Equal Pay for Equal Work Act (which I was the lead senate sponsor), and increased child care subsidy funding, and other laws, which have allowed hard working individuals to take care of themselves or family members when they are sick or not make others in workplace sick, allowed domestic violence victims to take care of their legal work, and have a workplace that promotes transparency, fairness, merit and productivity.  The state can continue to pass similar laws which will help hard working families support themselves and enable businesses to recruit and keep the best and most talented workforce, all which will help boost our economy.","I support a comprehensive federal measure, instead of piece meal measures by the state, that will ensure an independent commission of multi-partisan, unaffiliated voters, diverse stakeholders with public input and a process and standards that support fairness and effective representation.","The law was intended to be a balance that would make changes in police training, standards, effectiveness, and accountability, while protecting  citizens' complaint processes, rights, and participation, as well as keeping communities safe.  As our laws continue to be a work in progress, there is always ways in which are our laws can be improved.","In addition to the legislation already passed by the General Assembly, there must be comprehensive collaboration by federal, state, and local government, health care providers and systems, law enforcement, prosecutors, victims, families, and other stakeholders on legislation, funding, policies, and programs to support education, awareness, intervention, addiction and overdose programs, new technologies and medical treatments for prevention and treatment, prescription drug guidelines and  best practices, and other measures to effectively address the opioid addiction and overdose crisis.","The Maryland General Assembly has and can continue to work to pass legislation to strengthen laws to fight race, color, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender, religion, age, and disability discrimination and discrimination against people of all backgrounds.  This session, the legislature passed laws to fight and address sexual harassment, which creates a hostile work environment and barriers to an employee's ability to succeed and achieve their fullest potential.  I was also the Senate Lead Sponsor of the Maryland Equal Pay for Equal Work Act, which updated and strengthened the state's pay equity law by prohibiting discrimination based on sex or gender identity, allowing an employee to ask or inquire about wage disparities without fear of retaliation or being fired, banning Mommy Tracking and employers from using affirmative defenses that are based not on merit, but on sex, gender identity, prior discriminatory practices, or outdated stereotypes, and creating a workplace that promotes transparency, fairness, merit and productivity.   The law is now one of the strongest pay equity laws in the nation.  I was also the Senate Lead sponsor of legislation to correct a loophole in the law that prevented individuals with certain serious disabilities from receiving vital nursing services (that enabled them to work) and continuing to work to support themselves.  I will continue to work on legislation to address income inequality.","While updates in our Public Information Act and open meetings laws were good steps in increasing accessibility, transparency and accountability, new issues addressing privacy rights, surveillance video, new technologies, government accountability, and other emerging issues also should be addressed.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education? Are you committed to funding associated reforms, and if so, how?","Is Maryland’s transportation spending appropriately balanced between roads and transit?

Current small business owner - Chesapeake Realty Investors, Inc.","I agree with some of the findings.  Among these are the need for better trained teachers and holding teachers more accountable.  We must remember that merely throwing money at a problem does not solve it.  Maryland spending on education is among the top in the nation.  Funding needs to be tied to results and school administration must be held accountable for the large amounts of money currently under their control.  Too often money is wasted and/or unaccounted for. A school is not a replacement for a home-life and a family where education starts. It used to be that a child came to school to learn. Now schools are expected to feed them, teach them right from wrong, and take the place of parenting, while at the same time tying teachers hands when discipline is needed.","When we try to force people out of their cars and into a public transportation system we end up with a system that is way over budget and grossly underutilized, like the Baltimore subway.  We don't have the resources to force people to use something that is simply inconvenient. Governor Hogan has said that he will address traffic issues on I95, I295 and other major highways surrounding Baltimore.  However, for this to be effective, the Baltimore Beltway especially needs to be addressed as it carries traffic between those roads.  Anyone traveling during rush hour understands this. Gasoline taxes and tolls already bring in enough funding to pay for these improvements.",Yes.  People in a free society should be able to make their own decisions as long as they are not hurting anyone else.  At one time gambling was against the law because we thought it was bad for people and now it brings millions of dollars into the states treasury.  Legalizing marijuana would decrease drug dealers as well as our prison population.,"The Chesapeake is a treasure and must be protected.  We do, however, have enough regulations and laws that have lead to significant improvements over the last 30+ years.  We are reaching a point where the regulations hinder employment and business growth and a more balanced approach must taken in the future.","We should eliminate Obama care once and for all.  Allow insurance companies to operate across state lines and create competition between insurers – that will give Marylander's the best rates possible, rather than creating an artificial environment.",The best thing the state can do is ensure that judges are appointed who believe in incarcerating violent criminals for a long time.  Unfortunately the Baltimore City delegation to Annapolis is much more concerned with the rights of the criminals because they continuously fight against toughening laws for hardened criminals. I believe Baltimore City residents deserve the same protection as people living in the rest of the state and the only was to ensure this is to deal with violent repeat offenders in the harshest way possible.  Baltimore City also needs to play its part – too often Baltimore City juries refuse to convict violent criminals at trial.  If Baltimore City juries don't take crime in the city seriously why should the burden fall on the rest of the state?,"The business climate is fair – we are still too highly regulated.  We give big businesses tax breaks to lure them here, while mom and pop businesses are over-regulated and overtaxed.  Don't overlook the businesses that are already here - we should offer them the same incentives that we are using to lure businesses, like Amazon,  from other states.",Maryland is one of the worst gerrymandered states in the country where the politicians pick the voters instead of the other way around.  Redistricting should be done with an eye on keeping communities together and lines should be drawn by impartial panels and not by politicians concerned about being re-elected.,"No, under this bill officers are only judged by other officers.  And it prevents the formation of civilian review boards that give civilians oversight over police.  The result is other officers judging each other rather than seeking input from an impartial third party.  In addition, the police board cannot acknowledge that an officer is under investigation.  If the charges are dropped the department may not publically acknowledge that that investigation ever took place or reveal the nature of the complaint.",80% of heroin addicts begin with an addiction to over prescribed pain medications.  The opioid issue is massive and is growing increasingly more complex and dangerous.  I would participate in counsels to address solutions giving those addicted the help they need and provide education for alternative pain relief options.,It is not the responsibility of the government to ensure income equality.  We are not a socialist state.  This has been tried in Cuba and Russia with bad results.,"In theory it works well.  However, in reality, we are still subject to the various layers of bureaucracy.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

Prior to going to law school, I worked as an administrator at Towson University where I developed and managed educational and leadership programs for undergraduate student organizations.","I am generally supportive of the Commission's findings and that is why I voted for House Bill 1415 this year, legislation that aligns with and advances the goals of the Commission. Prior to this, I supported House Bill 999 (2016), which established the Commission.  I am passionate about reducing achievement gaps based on income and race as I firmly believe that a child's zipcode and race should not determine whether they have access to a world-class education. In addition to improving outcomes, I am committed to funding the development of innovative computer science and IT curricula to meet the needs of a rapidly-changing economy. Automation threatens to eliminate many good-paying jobs both in the public and private sector, and we need to ensure that Maryland is well positioned to meet the demands of tomorrow's workforce. We also need to expand career opportunities for educators to attract and retain the best and brightest teachers, and we must improve the quality of standardized testing in our primary and secondary schools.","I believe that the Hogan administration has appropriately balanced roads and transit spending. With respect to our new transit system, BaltimoreLink, I believe that there have been marked improvements in both rider reliability and access to high-frequency transit. BaltimoreLink has also expanded access to job centers throughout the metro area. As an elected official, I have been impressed by the Department of Transportation's level of engagement with citizens, community groups, and legislators, and I am glad that department officials are committed to soliciting and  relying upon stakeholder feedback when making decisions about local transportation projects.","Given the challenges associated with the rollout of the medical marijuana industry in Maryland, I'm not convinced that the question of legalization for recreational use is even ripe at this point in time. Intellectually, it's a conversation we can certainly have (e.g., debating the functional difference between alcohol consumption and recreational use of cannabis when it comes to health and public safety outcomes), but, for now, let's keep the focus on helping our citizens gain access to medical treatment. That has been my focus as a member of the House Health and Government Operations Committee over the last four years.","Maryland should continue to prioritize Bay restoration efforts through the state budget, while our federal delegation should continue advocating for federal funding. We must also call upon our neighboring states to serve as partners in restoration efforts and sustainability.","There are an estimated 174,000 uninsured people in Maryland who are working but make too much money for ACA subsidies. For these Marylanders, insurance is anything but affordable. A family of four in the individual market with the current Gold Plan pays over $22,000 in premiums each year. The same family might expect to pay over $15,000 under a Bronze Plan. Assessing a higher deductible while providing the ten essential health benefits as defined by the ACA is one solution that could lower premiums by as much as 25% for Bronze Plan families, and as much as 84% for Gold Plan families. This alternative plan would be exempted from requiring additional state-mandated benefits, but these are benefits most people never use (but get stuck footing the bill for). This option will keep uninsured people out of the emergency room, which will help prevent higher costs to the broader health care system.  Maryland should also be looking to other states that have been successful in reducing premiums for innovative policy solutions.","It is critical that Baltimore  be able to compete with other major American cities for economic development opportunities and investment. Growth is vital if we are to create new jobs and stability for families in and around the city. But what company or prospective employer would want to call Baltimore home if its streets are unsafe, or if its homicide rate remains among the highest in the country?  The state must focus on making Baltimore an attractive play to live, work, and raise a family if we're going to remain competitive. I, therefore, believe that it is prudent for the General Assembly to play a role in helping the city address violent crime as it did in the closing days of the 2018 session when we passed bipartisan legislation that focused on cracking down on violent offenders, including volume drug dealers, through the imposition of harsher sentences. To be sure, our efforts represented a good start, but there is much work to be done in this area.","Maryland has benefited from a remarkable economic turnaround under the leadership of Governor Hogan. Since he took office, Maryland has gained over 110,000 jobs and holds the #1 ranking for job growth in the Mid-Atlantic region. In addition, our state's unemployment rate has dropped by 25 percent under Hogan. And according to a recent CNBC report, Maryland ranked seventh nationwide in economic performance.   So, candidly, if we want to continue to create family-supporting jobs and grow our economy, the answer is simple: re-elect Larry Hogan. His economic policies are working!","Yes! In fact, this is the issue that ""got me off the couch"" five years ago when I first decided to run for a seat in the state legislature. The idea that politicians in Annapolis manipulate electoral outcomes for partisan or political gain is maddening.  In my first session as a member of the House, I introduced legislation, House Bill 906 (2015), to create an independent body to draw legislative and congressional district maps using fair, impartial, and objective standards; standards that would allow voters to choose their elected representatives, not the other way around.  I have also authored legislation, the Maryland Fair Representation Act,  House Bill 1328 (2018), which would guarantee that all Marylanders enjoy an equal voice and equal representation in the House of Delegates. Currently, about two-thirds of Marylanders have three delegates, while the remaining one-third  have only one or two representatives in the lower chamber. This is a clear violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause and an affront to our democratic process. But, more importantly, it's just plain wrong. It not only foments public distrust in state government, but undermines the very integrity of our elections.","Yes, the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights adequately balances protections for police and the public. Baltimore City certainly has challenges with respect to policing policy (that should be addressed by city leaders), but one jurisdiction's need for reform should not necessitate sweeping changes to the LEOBR, which works well across the State of Maryland.","In addition to all of the important steps we are already taking, I would place a greater emphasis on educating our young people on the dangers of experimentation, particularly because of how high addicting these substances are. Many do not perceive trying opioids as risky. According to a study done by the University of Michigan, ""[a]lthough Opioid Pain Relivers have an abuse liability similar to that of heroin, they are commonly perceived as less risky. Seventy-three percent of eighth graders surveyed in 2013 perceived occasional use of heroin without a needle as high risk, but only 26% perceived occasional use of Vicodin as high risk. Eighth graders also perceived occasional Vicodin use as less risky than occasional marijuana use, less risky than smoking 1–5 cigarettes per day, and less risky than moderate alcohol use."" This is alarming and tells me that we need to raise awareness about just how dangerous opioids, fentanyl, and carfentanil really are through educational programs and initiatives.","We should focus on creating apprenticeship programs  for high school graduates in underrepresented communities, as well as foster the development of more public-private partnerships  in emerging industries, such as IT. The state can offer tax incentives to employers in these industries who will provide on-the-job training for socioeconomically disadvantaged candidates, as well as opportunities for gainful employment after the completion of such training.","Maryland's PIA laws generally work well, but I have two major concerns: 1) At times, jurisdictions will use ""prohibitive cost"" reasoning to prevent information from being gathered and transmitted. This needs to be addressed, particularly if a requestor individual can suggest a more cost-effective way to access requested information;and 2) The General Assembly continues to move legislation in (literal) backrooms in the State House and government office buildings, with little or no notice, no opportunity for public comment, and, in some cases, no access for the press. This is completely unacceptable. A vote that's announced mere minutes before it is taken violates the spirit of our open meetings laws.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

This can be done through a commission that has the power to impose restrictions and provide the resource to provide the care for the addition.",If we provide less regulations and less taxes on small businesses - they will grow and they will hire employees and provide more jobs.

I have also served in elected positions since 2014. More importantly, I have a working relationship with the current Maryland State Senator, C. Anthony Muse, and have actively engaged with him regarding legislation impacting the 26th District and Maryland. As a result, he has endorsed me for the Maryland State Senate seat, which he will be vacating. Finally, I was accepted in the 2018 Emerge Maryland class, which will further prepare me as a woman running for a Democratic office.","Yes. I believe that funding for associated reforms should include leveraging money from developers who come to the county, and should be put into a lock- box.  All funding should be in addition to the established budget for education, increasing pre-K and expanding K-12 innovative learning opportunities. Finally, money should be specified to increase teacher salary and retention, and appropriate school construction projects.","No, Maryland's transportation spending is not appropriately balanced between roads and transit.  Yes, the state has the resources to meet its transportation needs.   Baltimore Link could benefit from more transient -oriented construction. This will afford residents the opportunity to be able to increase employment options, social options, and live in the vicinity of public transportation.","No. As far as I understand, recreational marijuana can have a negative impact on brain cells and functioning.",I will support initiatives that continue Bay restoration programing that began in 1983 that resulted in underwater grass abundance to female crab population growth and water clarity.,I believe that Maryland should enter into a thorough research inquiry into a single-payer health care system. This system will provide healthcare services for all.,Baltimore could address the underlying trauma that tends to result in an increase in violent crime. This trauma could be addressed through an increase in mental health services that begin as early as elementary school and continue through high school. Access to increased mental health services will undoubtedly help to reduce violent crimes and so forth.,"Maryland's business climate is promising. There are numerous opportunities available that can help to increase the success of small businesses.  Additionally, through the increase of collegiate, vocational, apprenticeship, and internship programs, the business climate will undoubtedly improve.","Yes, I support the creation of a non-partisan, independent body to draw legislative and congressional district maps after each census.","No. I believe the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights would be improved with the inclusion of more citizens on review boards, with voting power,  and investigations involving brutality.",I believe there must be increased education on opioid and the impact it has on residence.

Bush's Administration, Deputy Chief of Staff for Maryland Governor Bob Ehrlich's Executive Office, and now serving as State Delegate in the Maryland General Assembly.  Areas of focus include homeland security, public safety, social and faith-based services, and budget and appropriations.","As a member of the House Appropriations Committee and as an active member in local education meetings,  I have been attending the Kirwan Commission meetings focusing on career-trade-technology education which is one of the priorities of the Commission.  I supported the extension of the Kirwan Commission and $200 million in the FY '19  budget.  I   support the focus of the Kirwan Commission including Pre-kindergarten expansion, teacher recruitment, and career-technology education.  I also support the lockbox to ensure that casino proceeds go to education as originally promised.  I am particularly concerned with putting money into the classroom in order to directly benefit the teaching professionals and students. When the Maryland Lottery was first proposed it was determined that any funds would be dedicated to education. I would propose returning to that formula.","Currently road funding is woefully behind. As a representative of a district that is predominantly rural, I will continue to work  to return our Highway User funds to their rightful source to the counties and municipalities. I have been working along with Governor Hogan to restore Highway User Funds and believe that each year we have taken great strides for providing for the transportation needs of all Marylanders.  This year, I joined with my colleagues to pass legislation that provides certainty and predictability beginning in FY 2020 through FY  2024  by guaranteeing at least an additional $30 million in municipal HUR funding and an additional $32 million in county HUR  funding.  It is my belief that before we undertake a massive project such as the Red Line that we must first repair our aging infrastructure and provide funding to finally complete construction and expansion of the Baltimore Beltway.",No. In the midst  of a Heroin/Opioid epidemic marijuana can serve as a gateway drug to more potent forms of drugs. I have arrived at this decision after consulting with law enforcement and health officials and local families.,We should build on the success of local programs and partnerships including the work of non profits like the Maryland Coastal Bays Program.  In additionthe State should continue to adequately fund the Chesapeake and Atlantic Coastal Bays 2010 Trust Fund as was done in the FY 19 Budget at $52.9 million.,"The Maryland General Assembly and Governor Hogan worked to protect Marylanders from a dramatic 50% increase in their health insurance rates. House Bill 1795- Maryland Health Benefit Exchange - Establishment of a reinsurance Program creates the structure for a reinsurance program to be administered by the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange (MHBE), which is predicted to help stabilize rates for the next several years. I voted for this bill and the Governor has signed it into law.","All State law enforcement agencies should continue to serve in a supporting role to Baltimore law enforcement. I also believe HB 291/SB 1131 - Criminal Law - Prohibitions, Prosecutions and Corrections, which makes it easier to prosecute high volume drug dealers, will be a useful deterrent to violent crime. Also, legislation that increases the penalties for witness intimidation from 5 to 10 years will help address the violence in Baltimore. Both of these bills passed this Session.","In my District it is absolutely essential that we have a business climate competitive with Delaware and Virginia. I have consistantly supported policies and voted for initiatives that improve Maryland's business economy including regulatory relief, tax relief and a proactive partnership with our local jurisdictions to retain and attract businesses to Maryland. I have been working with area employers and local school systems to establish Career Trades Technology Education to develop a skilled workforce and to ensure that our students have the necessary skills to meet the requirements of our employers. I have a 100% rating from the Maryland Business for Responsive Government and have received the Maryland Retailers Association Award.",Yes.,"For the most part, I believe the current Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights adequately balances the protections for police and the public. Since I am aware that there are some flaws, I would be willing to consider some changes to improve the current policy after consultation with stakeholders affected by the policy.","As a member of the House Health Appropriations Committee and a member of the Worcester Opioid Intervention team, I have been working with Governor Hogan's Administration, my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and local stakeholder on a comprehensive strategy to strengthen education, prevention, treatment and recovery infrastructure, and law enforcement. I also believe that those who helped create this mess should ultimately pay for its clean up.","Addresssing income inequality starts with education. We empower all families by continuing to support historic levels of funding for Pre-Kindergarten - 12 and support the priorities of the Kirwan Commission which includes Pre-K expansion, teacher recruitment and Career Trade Technology Education. Geographical disparity in education has to be addressed to ensure an  even playing field so that students - regardless of where they live - are equally and adequately prepared to succeed in an ever increasingly competitive job market.",No. I favor ever increasing transparency  and will strive to see that all meetings of the General Assembley and it various committees and subcommittees be televised and available on the web.,"Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

Baltimore City Council 1982-1987
Maryland State Senate 1994-Present","Absolutely, I am a very strong supporter of education. We set aside in this years' budget $200,000,000 as a deposit on future funding needs for the implementation of Kirwan. We also passed the ""lock box"" legislation that will be on the ballot in the General Election that mandates all casino money to be used to increase and not supplant school funding.","There is an imbalance in Maryland under this administration where the appropriations are slanted significantly  towards roads. Baltimore Link is just what it says-link- not a   comprehensive, integrated mass transit system that the Baltimore region deserves.","Maybe in the future, but not at this time. We have to see how the medical cannibus initiative works.","Maryland, Virginia and Pennsylvania take the restoration of the Chesapeake Bay more seriously than the Trump administration. I stongly support the work of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, and will support all of  efforts and initiatives to clean up thhis important natural resource.  ","We need to recognize that the Republicans on Capitol Hill will do everything they can to decimate Obamacare, but we must ensure we have the tools make the ACA succeessful.  In Maryland, we are looking at an innovative solution which will create an individual mandate. It will work to keep our funds in an escrow-like setting that will give individuals and families the  opportunity to use those funds to purchase health insurance. This will expand the pool and lower rates for all. ",We need a comprehensive approach to Baltimore's crime problem that emphasizes  community policing and additional resources that result in more officers on foot patrol as opposed to desk and office duties. An enhanced use of tehnology can help in all areas. I also stongly support the multipronged approach we moved forward in the General Assembly to increase  penalties for repeat violent gun offenders while significantly increasing our Safe Streets program. We akso gave additional tools to the Baltimore City Police and The States Attorney's Office to assit in their effort to fighting crime.,"Maryland's business climate is underated, it works better for those with means but presents problems for many others. We need to do more to expand opporrunities for those without college degrees and expand tehnology related educational opportunities. We need to foster better alignment of the business needs of our citizens by expanding the skill sets of our residents through certified job training and apprentice prgrams. Further expansion of the Governors' P-Tech program  will provide additional opportunities for our high school students. Additionally, we need to make college education more afforable by passing legislation such as the degree without a debt bill that we passed in the General Assembly this year.",I think redistricting is a national problem that needs a national  and/or regional solution.  I hope the Supreme Court will lay out standards this summer to address this national problem.,In Maryland and many other states we are in many respects hampered by the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights (LEOBoR). This legislation has made it almost impossible to discipline and remove bad police officers. Under LEOBoR officers are judged  by other officers and it prevents civilian  input in the process. Recent events in Baltimore City clearly show we can and must do better. We must learn from our mistakes and make appropiate changes that clearly address the few bad actors in the Baltimore City Police Department. We need full participation of citizens on police trial boards. I also supported the creation of the state commission which will investigate allegations of police corruption that was revealed as a result of the Gun Trace Task Force investigation with supbeoena power.,"We need more options for treatment. We also need to be smarter on crime - by going after the high level drug kingpins, while ensuring that those who are low level drug users get diverted into programs that can help them. ","We need to address this critical issue - that's why I introduced legislation to raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour, but unfortunately it failed, It is also  why I supported paid sick leave, and voted to override the Governors veto. I am a very strong supporter of collective bargainng which enhance the opportunities for our hard working ctizens to raise their familites.We must also eliminate the disparities of income between men and women that was revealed in a recent study that showed women earning $.84 to every $100 earned by a man.","We can do better, for example when the Governor convened his  Sick Leave Task Force  without strict adherence to our open meetings law, there were no public records and little or no opportunity to hear the concerns of business people or  thier employees. We must avoid this happening in the future. It is essential that we do better in the General Assembly by taking additional steps to be more open and transparent. We should work to have our floor sesions live streamed to the public as are our comittee sessions.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?
