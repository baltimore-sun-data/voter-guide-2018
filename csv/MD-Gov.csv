,YES,governor,Rushern L. Baker III,Baker,10/24/1958,Cheverly,Democratic,I received my Bachelor's Degree and JD from Howard University and Howard Law.,"I have served as County Executive of Prince George's County from 2010 to present. Prior to serving as County Executive, I worked in private practice from 2009-2010. From 2003-2009, I was the executive director of a non profit organization that recruited and trained teachers to work in schools with diverse populations and urban problems. From 1994-2003, I served in the Maryland House of Delegates, representing legislative district 22B. After law school, I worked at the Peoples Involvement Corporation, where I worked as a community organizer to promote the general welfare of the citizens of the District of Columbia. I served for over 15 years as a JAG officer in the U.S. Army.",Elizabeth Embry,https://www.rushernbaker.com,RushernLBaker,rushernbaker,http://surveygizmoresponseuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/fileuploads/296249/4255081/179-3005753b5d3f45f3177ab7a53795312a_countyexec_thumb.jpg,"For me, education is personal. I know that education can change lives because it changed mine. As a kid, I struggled with reading, got into fights often, and was kicked out of many schools. If it weren't for my loving parents and dedicated teachers, I would not have had the opportunity to be the first in my family to graduate college. I know that fully funding schools is the first step to ensuring that every student in our state has the same opportunities I had. I strongly support the policies recommendations put forward by the Maryland Commission on Innovation & Excellence, particularly the recommendations that schools are fully funded. Fully funding education has been, and will remain a top priority for me. Our public schools are the heart of our communities. A good school is the sign of a healthy community, providing students with a lifetime of opportunity and a signal to families and businesses that this is somewhere they should move to and invest. As County Executive, I have consistently fought for increases in school funding for higher teacher salaries; dual-enrollment programs; expanded universal pre-k and full-day kindergarten. As governor, I will prioritize fully funding our school systems.","As one of the most densely populated states in the country, Maryland needs leadership that values the principles of smart growth and makes strategic investments in mass transit infrastructure over road construction. While I believe the best way to lead is by example, I will also continue to build on strong regional partnerships that I've developed as County Executive in order to maximize the strengths of our region for the benefit of our residents. If you want to bring jobs and economic development to Maryland, you start by investing in mass transit projects. Baltimore, which has been historically underserved with transit options, deserves the kind of economic prosperity and improved quality of life that accompanies mass transit, like the Red Line. In Maryland we need a cultural shift away from single-occupancy vehicles towards mass transit options. I would prioritize projects such as the Southern Maryland Light Rail project in Charles County and the Corridor Cities Transitway (CCT) BRT project in Montgomery County and explore extending the CCT all the way up to Hagerstown. These are 21st century solutions to our transit problems that will not only connect more people to jobs and take more cars off the road, but projects that will spur economic development in the communities they serve. As Governor, I would continue to support transit-oriented development around Metro stations and other mass transit options. I would support policies to increase the supply of market-rate and affordable housing to accommodate the increased demand to live in transit-rich areas.","There is significant evidence to suggest that legalizing recreational marijuana can lower crime rates, improve safety and provide significant tax revenue.","The agricultural sector is the largest source of pollution in the Chesapeake Bay as well as local waterways, and urban and suburban stormwater and rural septic systems are also pollution sources.Increased use of sustainable farming practices (organic farming, cover crops, crop rotation, etc.) could significantly improve the health of communities and the Bay. Additionally, with Maryland as the 5th most densely populated state, urbanization will continue to threaten our ecosystem if we do not take immediate smart growth action. We need to promote innovative partnerships to accelerate retrofits and stream restoration. We need to strictly enforce the ""financial assurance"" provisions in state law to ensure that all counties meet their obligations. Additionally, we need to make sure funding levels are sufficient to keep both point and nonpoint source pollution out of the Bay and its tributaries. Although Maryland must do everything it can within our borders, our neighbors to the north must be held responsible for their pollution that poisons our waters here, downstream. We must ensure that the operator of the Conawingo Dam does its part to remediate the accumulation there. We must also engage Pennsylvania to end its unmitigated agricultural runoff, up to and including litigation if necessary. Smart growth is important for the Bay, our communities, and for Maryland in general. Smart growth will help us direct growth to existing communities to help maintain their viability and therefore limit growth on farm and forest land.","Maryland made significant strides under the Affordable Care Act. In Prince George's County, we reduced the number of of uninsured and underinsured residents by over 50%. However many Marylanders are still facing exorbitant healthcare prices and many are still going uninsured. In order to ensure the broadest possible access to affordable health care, we need to improve access, reliability and affordability. We need to make sure that every Marylander has access to high quality hospitals and healthcare facilities. That's why in the county, I fought for the new Prince George's Regional Medical Center. We also need to improve reliability by stabilizing the health insurance market against the attempts made by the Trump Administration to undermine the Affordable Care Act. I support implementing a healthcare downpayment program to replace the federal individual mandate, which will ensure more long-term stability in the market so Marylanders are not facing crippling healthcare premium cost increases each year. Lastly, we need to improve affordability. Prescription drug prices make up a significant portion of healthcare costs each year. Let's end prescription drug price gouging in Maryland by 1) increasing transparency at the pharmacy about drug prices and lower cost options, 2) establishing a Drug Cost Commission that ensures reasonable costs for lifesaving drugs.","In the County, we were able to achieve historic reductions in crime in part because we had a partner in Governor O'Malley. That support is no longer there for counties. In the coming weeks, we will put forward a criminal justice reform and public safety proposal that will focus on short-term and long-term solutions. The State to partner with the City, as well as federal law enforcement agencies, to focus resources on repeat violent offenders. We need effective data sharing, prioritizing offenders under parole and probation and strategies for those at the highest risk of committing violent acts. The State must consistently partner with the City to identify and serve open warrants for violent crime. The recidivism rate in Baltimore City is staggering - estimates by DPSCS place it at 70%. Public Safety Compact, an innovative public-private partnership that finances in-prison drug treatment and comprehensive transition services upon release has worked in Maryland. The recidivism rate for the program after three years is less than 10 percent and saved $2.5 million. Governor Hogan stopped the program, I would reinstate immediately. We will look at ways to address the systemic issues that perpetuate crime including poverty, lack of jobs and poor education, reduce prison populations, address racial disparity, and eliminate barriers for formerly incarcerated individuals to return to their communities. The State must work to disrupt the school to prison pipeline by investing in programs like Roca that provide job training for at-risk teenagers; and provide educational opportunities in juvenile facilities.","Maryland is falling behind our regional partners in terms of wages and job creation. We must look at ways to get us back on track so businesses want to move to Maryland. My comprehensive Equity for Women initiative addresses ways to create a more equitable and profitable business climate for Maryland. The fastest growing group of entrepreneurs in the country are African-American women, starting businesses at a rate 1.5% faster than the national average. Maryland is a leader in African-American women owned businesses. But yet, African-American women only receive 0.2% of venture capital funding. Fueling this engine means more jobs in the communities that have been historically overlooked. I will also establish the Maryland Economic Development Incentive Fund that matches state dollars for counties and cities that start municipal EDI Funds that invest in county businesses and create jobs. We also need to provide 12 weeks of paid parental leave. Studies show that paid family leave is economically beneficial for companies and improves employee retention. Private sector investment is a catalyst for economic development. We need to create a climate where businesses know that they have a willing partner at the State. Maryland needs to prepare for the economies of the future with a skilled educated workforce in cyber security, biotechology, health care, climate change, advanced manufacturing, business services, digital learning. We need to create a culture where a young, skilled, diverse, and mobile workforce wants to live, and the businesses will want to locate here.","Yes. Non-partisan redistricting ensures that no political party can rig the system. ""Safe districts"" can lead to a decrease in voter participation, limit voter choice and reduce the incentive to have meaningful debate and conversations.","We must always look to improve processes and procedures, the Law Enforcement Bill of Rights is no exception. We must strengthen trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve, one way to do this is by looking at ways we can shore up the LEOBR to ensure transparency and accountability. One way to strengthen this process is to make sure internal investigations are simultaneous with criminal proceedings - this would prevent delaying criminal proceedings. We can extend the period of time an individual can file an excessive force complaint. We must look at ways to better balance the safety and due process of officers and ensuring that we hold ""bad apples"" accountable.","As Governor, I would focus on three core areas: 
1) saving lives that are in immediate danger; 
2) providing treatment on demand; and 
3) addressing opiate prescription abuse through education and enforcement. 

Narcan must be accessible and affordable for individuals, families, and first responders. It must be available in our prisons, which routinely deal with opioid crisis. Treatment for opioid addiction should be available on demand at crisis centers so that no one waits weeks for help, because even a matter of days can be the difference between life and death. To achieve a statewide treatment system that meets the scale of addiction, we need to work with local public health practitioners and addiction experts to make sure we have the best possible data, and the most effective treatment options, to build a statewide network. Many of the people now suffering from addiction first became addicted through prescription opioids. We need to work with our Attorney General to effectively sue the manufacturers and distributors who caused the flood of opiates into our state, we need to identify and quickly educate those medical professionals who have not come to understand the dangers of opiates, and we have to bring enforcement actions against pill mills and those who are prescribing with no medical necessity. We are making strides in Baltimore, thanks to the leadership of Dr. Leana Wen, and we can use these learnings to bring relief to individuals with the disease of addiction across Maryland.","The first step to address income inequality is to require employers to pay their employees a livable wage. As governor, I will work to ensure that the minimum wage is $15 across the state. Voters should never listen to a politician who says that raising the minimum wage means losing jobs. Because in the County, we raised the minimum wage to the highest in the state and still cut unemployment by half, and have continued to lead the state in job creation for the past five quarters. I also know that providing a quality education, access to higher education and economic opportunity for all is necessary to address income inequality. In our 21st century economy, a high school diploma is no longer enough to succeed. As Governor, we can make community college debt free. And for those children who chose not to attend college, we can make sure they are career-ready by expanding access to apprenticeships and technical training. I also know that job opportunities are crucial. As governor, I will establish the Maryland Economic Development Incentive Fund that matches state dollars for counties and cities that start municipal EDI Funds that invest in county businesses. Additionally, the Maryland EDI Fund will target incentivized lending and grants as a way to impact employment statistics among statistically trailing demographic groups. This will help small businesses grow and create jobs across the state.","The Public Information Act and open meetings laws are bare minimum in transparency standards. We should look at ways to reduce delays and fees for public access to government information. We can do more to provide Marylanders with more transparency in their government, including using more robust data analytics to measure the effectiveness of state programs in providing services and addressing the issues we face. We should revamp StateStat and BayStat from the O'Malley era, for example. As County Executive, I established a CountyStat program and it has been very successful in increasing reporting and transparency of public programs.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

,YES,governor,Larry Hogan,Hogan,5/25/1956,Annapolis,Republican,"Governor Hogan attended DeMatha Catholic High School in Hyattsville, Maryland and Florida State University.","Larry Hogan is the 62nd Governor of Maryland. Prior to his election, Governor Hogan worked in the private sector for more than 25 years as a successful Maryland small business owner.",Boyd K. Rutherford,https://www.LarryHogan.com,LarryHogan,LarryHogan,http://surveygizmoresponseuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/fileuploads/296249/4255081/52-29b73a7f6ec6c84761fc4bddd8c612fd_larry-hogan-md-gov.jpg,"Governor Hogan strongly supports the work of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education and has repeatedly expressed his disappointment that this group chose not to present their final recommendation prior to this most recent legislative session. Nevertheless, the governor believes that every child should have access to a world-class education regardless of the neighborhood they happen to grow up in. That is why he provided record funding for education in each of his four budgets. In total, the governor committed $25 billion for K-12 education over the past four years, more than any other governor in Maryland history. In 2007, the O'Malley administration promised voters that casinos revenues would be used to grow education funding. Governor Hogan has pledged to make sure the state keeps that promise through an education ""lockbox"" for casino revenue that will increase education funding by $4.4 billion over the next 10 years, including an additional $1 billion for school construction. He also called for $125 million from these casino revenues to be dedicated for immediate school safety improvements, plus $50 million per year for mental health counselors, school safety officers, and other school safety efforts. Governor Hogan is also committed to advocating for innovative solutions to improve education outcomes with initiatives such as P-TECH Schools. P-TECH schools are a nationally recognized approach that blends high school, college, and on-the-job work experience. Maryland now has five P-TECH schools, including two in Baltimore City.","Governor Hogan is committed to a holistic approach to transportation, which prioritizes both transit and road improvements. That's why Governor Hogan worked tirelessly from his first day in office to rebuild Maryland's crumbling roads and to expand access to public transportation. Upon taking office, Governor Hogan was determined to reverse the neglect of the previous administration, and he announced a $2 billion investment to build and repair roads and bridges across Maryland. Governor Hogan continues to focus on delivering much-needed transportation improvements with over $8 billion dedicated towards fixing roads and bridges, and more than 8,000 lane-miles repaved. There are currently nearly 1,000 projects under construction across Maryland, totaling $9 billion. The Hogan administration has invested $7 billion in new transportation projects in the Baltimore region, including $1.4 billion to add two express lanes in each direction on the Baltimore-Washington Parkway and $461 million to add 27 miles of new highway lanes on the Baltimore Beltway and 1-95 north of Baltimore. Maryland has the second-longest commuting times in the country. To address this, Governor Hogan has outlined an innovative Traffic Relief Plan that includes major widening and targeted technological improvements to the Capital Beltway, I-270, the Baltimore/Washington Parkway, the Baltimore Beltway, and I-95 north of Baltimore, greatly reducing traffic congestion on these vital roadways. Governor Hogan believes improving Maryland's highways goes hand-in-hand with mass transit solutions. In 2017, the Governor joined the Maryland Transit Administration to launch BaltimoreLink, transforming and improving the transit system for the first time in decades.","Governor Hogan supports the use of marijuana for medical purposes and understands that countless people have been and will continue to find relief from all forms of illness and pain through its responsible use. He has taken several proactive steps to improve the commission that governs this industry and supported increasing the level of diversity in the ownership of both growers and sellers. This is a new and developing industry in Maryland that has only recently started servicing clients and the governor is closely monitoring its progress and overall impact on our state. The governor believes that before any significant effort takes place to legalize the recreational use of marijuana, our state needs to better understand and study the effects of medical marijuana. Ultimately, a change of this magnitude and potential consequence would need to be decided by Marylander voters and only after a lengthy and very open and transparent public debate.","Governor Hogan has made protecting the environment a cornerstone of his administration, especially Maryland's greatest natural asset, the Chesapeake Bay. Under Governor Hogan's leadership, the Chesapeake Bay is the healthiest it's been in 25 years. As governor and Chair of the Chesapeake Executive Council, he has committed more than $4 billion to extensive Chesapeake Bay restoration projects. For his strong commitment to the Bay, Governor Hogan was named the ""Champion of the Chesapeake."" While Governor Hogan has invested tremendous state funding to protect the Chesapeake, he has also fought any attempts by the federal government to shirk their own commitment to the Bay. When President Donald Trump's budget called for cutting funding for Chesapeake Bay programs from $73 million to $7.3 million, Governor Hogan fought successfully to restore full funding.","There are few things more important to Marylanders than the ability to care for their families and loved ones, and having access to affordable, high-quality health care is pivotal in those efforts. In response to these realities, the governor is a tireless advocate for Marylanders fighting against changes at the federal level that would harm citizens. He is working to ensure Maryland continues to lead the way on innovation in the health care sector on the state level. Throughout the debate over the future of the Affordable Care Act, Governor Hogan repeatedly voiced his opposition to any changes by Congress and the Trump administration that would jeopardize Marylanders' access to quality health care. That's why he is actively partnering with other state leaders across the country committed to making health care more affordable. Due to many years of political dysfunction and failure by national leaders in Washington, health insurance rates, especially in the individual market, skyrocketed over the last decade. In the coming year, rates were predicted to increase in Maryland by 50 percent or more, potentially causing a catastrophic breakdown of our state insurance market. Governor Hogan immediately established an executive negotiating team to work in a bipartisan fashion with the General Assembly to pass and enact legislation stabilizing our insurance market and keeping premiums down. Due to the governor's leadership and willingness to partner with the General Assembly, landmark legislation was passed that protects Marylanders' health care options and stabilizes insurance rates.","Every Marylander deserves to feel safe in their homes and communities. They need to know that our criminal justice system is fair and equal in its application and enforcement of the law. And they need to know that once people enter the criminal justice system, they will come out newly prepared to live productive, law-abiding lives. These are guiding principles for Governor Hogan. When it comes to crime and justice, Governor Hogan seeks to distinguish between non-violent offenders who made mistakes and need a second chance versus repeat violent criminals who belong behind bars. In 2016, the Governor Hogan partnered with legislators from both parties to enact the innovative Justice Reinvestment Act. Designed to help end the mass incarceration of non-violent criminals, the JRA represented the most comprehensive criminal justice reform to become law in Maryland in a generation. But Governor Hogan also believes that criminals who threaten our families with violence deserve harsh penalties. That is why he introduced and passed a series of initiatives to combat criminal gangs and repeat violent offenders who participate in violent crime throughout the state - especially in Baltimore City. Governor Hogan also announced a joint law enforcement effort to establish a more visible presence in high crime areas of Baltimore City. This operation led to 500 arrests, including 259 of the city's most violent criminals. The governor also announced Project C.O.R.E., a $100 million blight removal program in Baltimore City, to remove abandoned, dilapidated properties that had become breeding grounds for crime.","In 2014, under Governor Hogan's predecessor, CNBC ranked Maryland as having the 24th best economy in the country. Reflecting Governor Hogan's pro-economic growth agenda, Maryland has jumped 17 spots and now has the 7th best economy in the nation. When Governor Hogan was inaugurated in 2015, he made it a point to say that Maryland was now ""Open for Business."" In the four years that he has been governor, Maryland has seen a dramatic turnaround it its business climate, going from losing 100,000 jobs under his predecessor, to gaining nearly 100,000 jobs under Governor Hogan. In the eight years of Governor Hogan's predecessor, Marylanders were hit with more than forty tax, toll, and fee hikes, including even a tax on the rain. That run of tax, toll and fee hikes has ended under Governor Hogan, with four balanced budgets passed without a tax increase. All told, Governor Hogan has cut over $1.2 billion in taxes, tolls, and fees, allowing Marylanders to keep more of their hard-earned paychecks. In addition to unburdening taxpayers, Governor Hogan has pushed for the creation of good-paying jobs throughout Maryland. Governor Hogan's More Jobs for Marylanders Act has incentivized manufacturers to relocate and expand throughout Maryland, including in the Baltimore region. Governor Hogan has also worked to attract business from outside the state to create jobs in Maryland. Amazon announced that they were opening a new 855,000 square-foot fulfillment center at Tradepoint Atlantic in Baltimore County, which will create 1,500 new jobs for the region.","Governor Hogan is one of the nation's leading supporters of non-partisan redistricting reform. He believes that voters should pick their legislators, not the other way around. To accomplish this, Governor Hogan has called for ending gerrymandering and the creation of an independent redistricting commission. In 2015, Governor Hogan created the Maryland Redistricting Reform Commission, whose purpose was to create a better and fairer system for drawing congressional and legislative maps. Governor Hogan has also introduced the Redistricting Reform Act, which would ensure free and fair elections in Maryland by creating a nonpartisan redistricting commission. Additionally, Governor Hogan joined an amicus brief to the Supreme Court, with a bipartisan group of former and current governors, in support of the plaintiffs in Benisek v. Lamone, a case examining whether voters in Maryland's 6th Congressional District have had fundamental Constitutional rights violated through gerrymandering.","Governor Hogan recognizes the important balance that exists between supporting our law enforcement officers and making sure that appropriate legal and civilian oversight exists. Throughout his term in office, the governor has sought to find that balance by both supporting our law enforcement officers, the vast majority of which are incredible public servants, and encouraging the aggressive prosecution of corrupt officers who are abusing the public trust and ultimately making our streets and communities less safe. In the wake of the Baltimore City riots and the death of Freddie Gray, the governor signed bills into law that increased civilian oversight and required reporting for the Baltimore City Police Department. The governor also increased, for the first time in decades, the limits for a civil claim against a local or state government. Additionally, Governor Hogan partnered with the General Assembly to enact the Justice Reinvestment Act. Designed to help end the mass incarceration of non-violent criminals, the JRA represented the most comprehensive criminal justice reform to become law in Maryland in a generation. This law is helping transform the state's criminal justice system to better protect our communities by providing treatment to non-violent offenders struggling with addiction, and supervising low-level offenders in the community working to get back on the right path. Any changes to the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights needs to balance the common-sense concerns of communities across the state while also acknowledging the real dangers law enforcement officers face everyday while serving and protecting our communities.","Under Governor Hogan's leadership, Maryland was the first state in the nation to declare a state of emergency to fight the opioid crisis. Since then, Governor Hogan has brought significant resources to bear to tackle this problem. In four years as Governor, the state has committed over $500 million in prevention, enforcement, treatment, and education funding efforts to address the opioid crisis. Upon taking office, Governor Hogan created the Heroin and Opioid Emergency Task Force and appointed Lt. Governor Boyd Rutherford to lead their work. The Task Force traveled across Maryland, soliciting input and advice from a wide-ranging group of stakeholders, and offered 33 recommendations for fighting the opioid crisis. Governor Hogan also created Opioid Operation Command Center, which has worked to raise public awareness of this terrible problem. The OOCC launched the ""Before It's Too Late"" public awareness campaign, which educates families, educators, and healthcare professionals about the opioid crisis. In addition to Governor Hogan's work on the state level, he has also sought to raise this issue on the federal level. In March, Governor Hogan testified before the U.S. Senate, and called on the federal government to do more in addressing the enforcement and funding challenges related to the opioid crisis in Maryland and across the country.","Governor Hogan is committed to growing Maryland's economy so that it works for everyone. He believes that the best way address income inequality is to grow the economy and create more good-paying jobs and ensure every Marylanders has the high quality education and training they need to take advantage of these opportunities. Maryland currently has the highest median household income in America and went from losing 100,000 jobs under his predecessor, to gaining nearly 100,000 jobs during his tenure. The unemployment rate has also dropped to 4.2% during Governor Hogan's term. Since 2015, when Governor Hogan took office, average weekly earnings in Maryland have increased by 12.5%. And this year, Maryland's average weekly wage became the highest its been in over a decade. Governor Hogan has also enacted policies that will create new economic development in Maryland. Last year, the Governor announced his ACCESS Initiative (Achieving Computer Science Collaborations for Employing Students Statewide) which seeks to increase the number young women and minorities exposed to computer science education as preparation for higher wage technology jobs where they are currently underrepresented. Governor Hogan created the EARN (Employment Advancement Right Now) Maryland program, a development grant program that seeks to ensure that businesses in Maryland have the employees needed to compete in today's economy. The governor has also sought to build on the success of his More Jobs for Marylanders Act with More Jobs for Marylanders 2.0, which would expand the number of industries that could receive incentives from the program.","For too long, political corruption has infected Annapolis and local governments around our state, contributing to public cynicism and eroding trust in our institutions. Governor Hogan was elected to clean up the mess in Annapolis, and over the past four years, that is exactly what he has done. The governor fundamentally believes that Maryland state government - and those who lead it - have a duty to be better than the failed Washington-style politicians. He will never stop fighting for common sense, bipartisan government reforms, transparency, and accountability. Marylanders deserve accountability and transparency from their elected officials. That is why Governor Hogan is fighting to require that General Assembly sessions be video livestreamed. Maryland is unfortunately one of only seven states to not allow citizens to view live video of legislative deliberations. Marylanders have a right to know what their elected officials are saying as they debate important issues. The governor's Legislative Transparency Act would correct this flaw and allow Marylanders to watch their legislators in action. Last year, in the aftermath of a rash of state and federal criminal investigations targeting lawmakers in Annapolis - cases that resulted in multiple indictments and resignations from office - Governor Hogan led the successful fight for the Public Integrity Act of 2017. It was the most far-reaching and comprehensive ethics reform bill in our state in over a decade. The law expanded public disclosure requirements, tightened conflict of interest rules, and strengthened restrictions on using public office for personal gain.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

,YES,governor,Ben Jealous,Jealous,1/19/1973,Pasadena,Democratic,I studied at Columbia University earning a bachelor's degree in political science in 1997. I went on to study at Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar writing my thesis on suicide prevention for a master's degree in comparative social research. I now teach criminal justice as a Visiting Professor at Princeton University.,"For more than 20 years, I have worked in non-profit management or been a partner in a business. My background is largely as a civil rights leader, community organizer and businessman, as well as a stint as a journalist where my reporting focused on police corruption. I worked as a student organizer for the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and then later for the NAACP in Mississippi, fighting to prevent public HBCUs from being closed. I then went on to work as a reporter and managing editor at the Jackson Advocate in Jackson, Mississippi. After earning my master's degree, I went on to work as a program coordinator for the National Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty and then as the Director for Amnesty International's Domestic Human Rights Program. After this, I worked as the President of the Rosenberg Foundation -- a private grant-making organization and then in 2008 I was selected as the youngest-ever National President & CEO of the NAACP, where I doubled the organization's revenue.

I have committed to fully funding our public schools and ensuring that the casino and lottery revenue goes directly towards supplementing not supplanting historic sources of funding. There are several revenue sources we can turn to including requiring combined reporting and closing other tax loopholes. However, we also need to be better managers of the money we do have before we look towards other revenue sources. I believe that we don't so much have a funding problem as we have a priorities problem. My experience as a CEO and businessman has taught me how to optimize budgets, and I'll also use these skills to direct more funds into education.","When I'm governor, we will ensure that the Baltimore region has the 21st century transportation network it needs to be an engine of growth for the entire state. That means reviving the Red Line, expanding bus routes, and exploring a multimodal system that supports all types of transportation. Our current transportation spending is not appropriately balanced to meet the needs of all Marylanders and we need to think creatively about how to connect every worker to a job center and every student to their educational institution.",Yes. We need to tax and regulate marijuana for adult use. I've released a criminal justice platform which outlines the principles of equity that we will follow so as not to travel in the footsteps of Larry Hogan who managed to launch the medical marijuana industry in our state without a thought to racial diversity. I will work with political leaders like the Legislative Black Caucus to build strong diversity requirements for licenses in the marijuana industry and bring in at least $120 million in revenue for our state.,"Donald Trump has made it exceptionally clear that he has no interest in maintaining the health of our environment, including the Chesapeake Bay. We need a governor who's willing to make sure that Maryland becomes a leader again in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). Because the Bay absorbs pollution from 64,000 square miles of the American northeast, no one state can tackle this problem alone. They key to restoring the Chesapeake in the absence of federal leadership is cooperation among the states that cause runoff into the watershed. By reforming agricultural practices, and replacing broken infrastructure, Maryland can make a difference. But, ultimately, we would have to work with other states on policies, join other states in lawsuits, and hold the Federal Government accountable to uphold its responsibilities to our state.","The status quo is untenable. The only real solution is a Medicare-for-All system for which I have already laid out a plan for how we can get there and the intermediary steps we can take on my website, benjealous.com. We also need to directly negotiate with pharmaceutical companies to lower drug costs. When I was young, I suffered from juvenile epilepsy and I had to have my friend steal medication for me because I could have died without it. No family should have to choose between life-saving medication and poverty. The only way to get to universal access and cut costs is a Medicare-for-All system.",I'm the only candidate to have released both a comprehensive criminal justice reform plan and a police department reform plan. The state should work closely to ensure the safety of all of Maryland's jurisdictions. Here in Baltimore we need to provide funding to expand proven programs like Safe Streets and Roca as well as ensuring that civilians make up the majority of Hearing Boards for police misconduct.,"I've been a CEO or Partner in a business since I was 26 years old and now I work to grow startups and small businesses as a Partner at Kapor Capital. There are many regulations that we need to remove that hinder growth as well as ensuring that small businesses can access lines of credit. We also need to grow our economy from the bottom up, that means fully funding our schools and making sure we are investing in education from cradle to career. Implementing a Medicare-for-All system will ensure that small businesses don't see the cost of healthcare harming their bottom line year after year as premiums rise by double digits.",I believe that Maryland should lead the fight on redistricting reform in a fair and non-partisan manner that does not indefinitely hand control of the House of Representatives to Republicans. Redistricting compacts such as the one passed by the Maryland legislature and vetoed by Gov. Hogan are a fair and equitable solution to increase the accountability of Congress to the voters and reduce gerrymandering.,"Maryland's Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights has become a recurring barrier to police reform, ultimately making it more difficult to identify and punish officer misconduct. As governor, I will support legislation that requires all allegations of police brutality be investigated no matter the filing date and that removes the 10- day window officers have before being interviewed by investigators following an incident.","We need to start treating the opioid epidemic like the public health crisis it is. Last year, over 1,200 Marylanders died from overdoses related to heroin, twice the number that died in 2014, while over 1,100 died with fentanyl in their system. As the epidemic becomes more complex and costly, with deadlier drugs like fentanyl and carfentanil showing up on the streets, Maryland needs a bold approach to effectively combat the crisis. In the short term, my plan will save lives immediately by investing an additional $2 million in state funding to stock Naloxone, sufficient for 25,000 doses of the life-saving drug as well as funding overdose outreach teams in more jurisdictions around the state. I also seek to increase the number of 24/7 crisis centers in high-risk areas to ensure that anyone who needs it can receive help at any time. The plan ensures treatment on demand is available to those who seek it, free from the fear of criminal punishment, and expands treatment options available in correctional facilities. A core component of resolving the opioid crisis relies on treating addiction as the disease it is and shifting our collective attitude toward rehabilitation.","We need to raise wages across the board. I have been endorsed by SEIU because I am committed to raising the minimum wage to $15 and tying to inflation so that working families can count on having a living wage. When I'm governor, we'll invest in all our families starting by fully funding our schools, providing universal healthcare, and providing necessary supports to our small businesses. By investing in people we can build our economy from the bottom up.","As governor, I will aim to increase transparency at every level. I'm a lifelong civil rights leader and community organizer and I've always said that you don't elect politicians to make change happen, you elect politicians to make it a little easier for the people to make change happen. In regards to the operation of executive departments, I would implement more frequent releasing of reports from each department outlining the status of the permitting process and regulatory violations. These reports should be available free of cost and online so that the public can access them. I believe in greater transparency when it comes to public meetings as well, I would work individually with each department to determine how best to release relevant information to the public as well as create easy channels for the public to request information and make that information readily available whenever possible.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

Marylanders have long valued our investment in education and for years our public schools were ranked the nation's best; now, according Commission Chairman Kirwan, Maryland is just ""middle-of- the-pack."" Even worse, Maryland has massive disparities in educational outcomes and the eighth-worst achievement gap in the country. Meanwhile Governor Hogan continues to fund near the bare minimum. As governor, I'll fix that. That means committing to the Kirwan Commission's bold vision for the future of Maryland's public schools. If we are serious about returning Maryland's schools to the nation's best, Maryland must: • Revise antiquated funding formulae that have contributed to the historical disparities in our state while expanding capital funding for school construction; • Prioritize early childhood education to provide universal, high-quality prekindergarten; • Expand Maryland's commitment to attracting, retaining, and supporting educators; and • Reduce barriers to advanced learning opportunities, like I have done in Baltimore County through our Community College Promise and Early College High School programs. I look forward to reviewing—and responsibly implementing—the Commission's final recommendations with educators, advocates, and thought-leaders. Maryland is perhaps the richest per capita in the country and we can find a way to fully fund education, if we have a leader who will set bold priorities, create sustainable budgets, protect employees, and maximize taxpayer dollars. That's exactly the type of governing I have accomplished in Baltimore County. It is what I will do as our state's next governor.","Maryland's transportation needs aren't solved by just building highways. We need to invest in 21st century mass transit solutions that ease traffic congestion and promote economic development. Governor Hogan pulled the plug on the Red Line without any analysis or opportunity for public opinion, tossing aside a decade of thoughtful regional planning, turning away $900 million in federal funding, and moving $900 million of state money reserved to address transportation needs in the Baltimore region to rural road projects. His ""plan-B"" for Baltimore was a bungled color-coded bus system, and we are still stuck in traffic. The lack of thought and planning that went into that decision is deeply offensive and dismissive of the need for thoughtful long term investment. If we want Baltimore to be the world-class region we know it can be, we must provide world-class transit, and that means getting the region's rail plan back on track. We must provide faster, more reliable service to current high population areas, while including surrounding counties as part of the mass transit solution so that people have a viable alternative to the Beltway. By recommitting to a plan that integrates existing infrastructure, we can serve major employment centers and ease congested corridors—all while tapping the potential of the region to drive Maryland's growth for generations. And transit promotes economic development, as we have achieved at the Owings Mills and Hunt Valley rail stops.","Now that Maryland is getting its medical marijuana program up and running, I want to make sure we get that implementation right. Meanwhile, I continue to monitor states that have moved to full legalization to see what lessons we can learn. Legalization offers opportunities to reduce crime and provide taxation revenue to the state. I want to ensure Maryland moves forward in a measured and responsible way if voters here make the same determination as other states with marijuana legalization.","Climate change poses one of the most significant threats to our state's long-term health and prosperity. Unfortunately, Governor Hogan has consistently bent to the pressure of ""Big Chicken"" and other special interests by rolling back environmental protections and under-funding the inspectors who protect our health and safety. Meanwhile, the Trump Administration has gone unchecked by our governor as it tried to zero-out funding to protect our precious Chesapeake Bay and continues to push antiquated dirty fossil fuels. Today, Maryland's natural treasures have never been at greater risk. As governor, I will defend our Chesapeake Bay, which provides a $30 million annual economic impact in the form of fishery, recreation, and even land values. We must recommit to smart growth policies, and expand efforts to grow Maryland's clean energy economy, by: 

- Aggressively leading the charge to stand up to the Trump Administration and fully empowering the Attorney General to defend Marylanders in court; 
- Doubling Maryland's RPS targets to 50 percent by 2030, generating additional clean energy projects and confronting climate change impacts; 
- Expanding our state's commitment to renewable energy solutions with new investments in Maryland-based solar and wind to create good-paying jobs and reduce air pollution; 
- Continuing restorative practices that rebuild eroding stream beds and protect shorelines; 
- Expanding incentives and grants to help farmers implement practices that reduce soil erosion, promote nutrient cycling, and improve water retention while reducing chicken manure runoff; and 
- Doubling the number of oyster bed sanctuaries to help filter the Bay.","Health care is a basic human right and we have made great strides in expanding access with the Affordable Care Act. Our state's uninsured rate has been cut by about half since Obamacare became law; however, an estimated 200,000 Marylanders still struggle to obtain affordable insurance. At the same time, the Hogan Administration has stood by as costs have skyrocketed, approving 15 double digit rate hikes for Marylanders buying insurance on the exchange. Following recent efforts to sabotage the ACA by eliminating the individual mandate, Maryland must take action to improve the risk pool, stabilize markets, and lower premiums. The rapid increase of costs for life-saving medications is now pricing many out of the ability to take care of themselves or their loved ones. Maryland must do more to contain these rising costs and, when necessary, take legal action to stand up to major drug companies and insurance companies. As governor, I will protect and strengthen Obamacare to provide better care for Marylanders, by: 

- Exploring a ""Public Option"" on Maryland's Exchange that allows Marylanders to buy into Maryland's HealthChoice Medicaid Managed Care Program at reasonable prices, increasing access to doctors, hospitals and community health centers; 
- Reinstating the insurance mandate repealed by the Republican Congress, and use the funds to offset insurance premiums; and 
- Expanding opportunities to reduce costs by better integrating our unique hospital rate payer system with health care professionals.","The primary responsibility of government is to protect its citizens; however, under Governor Hogan's watch, we are seeing crime rise without a coordinated response. Rather than working as partners, Hogan shifts the blame onto local jurisdictions and offers antiquated and ineffective policies that will return to Baltimore to discriminatory policing and perpetuate systemic discrimination. The state must serve as a partner with Baltimore in the fight against crime, not a roadblock. As governor, I would support a number of strategies to increase collaboration between the state and Baltimore City, including: 

- Increasing coordination between parole and probation and local law enforcement to target violent offenders; 
- Providing assistance in the recruitment and training of police officers to ensure that BPD is operating at full strength; 
- Expanding actively monitored CCTV crime cameras and gunshot recognition technology and allowing state police to collaborate with BPD and staff the Citiwatch system; 
- Strengthening partnerships between State Police and Baltimore City Police Department to assist with traffic enforcement, freeing BPD officers to focus on strategic crime reduction; 
- Increasing support for violence interruption programs, like Safe Streets, to reduce shootings, restore neighborhood trust, and strengthen communities; and 
- Redoubling efforts to remove underlying causes of systemic violence, including the failure to achieve equitable performance in our public schools and a lack of economic opportunity. With a governor who is truly committed to working with Baltimore, we can make our communities and region safer, stronger, and more just.","Larry Hogan's economic development strategy is to use taxpayer funds to bribe large companies to stay in-state without requiring major job creation targets. Now, Maryland's economy is falling behind. According to an analysis by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Maryland's job growth has lagged behind our regional neighbors. By supporting investments in fundamental drivers of a strong and robust economy such as stronger K-12 public school system and job training opportunities, we can create a stronger pipeline of jobs. That's exactly what I've done in Baltimore County. When a century of steelmaking ended at Bethlehem Steel and 2,000 people were put out of work, I made it a priority to create the next generation of jobs. Today, Sparrows Point is coming back to life with 17,000 new jobs. We have also created the ""Job Connector"" program in Baltimore County that collaborates directly with employers to expand training in key fields and increase access to high-quality jobs. Thanks to programs like these, Baltimore County has cut our unemployment rate in half. As governor, I will create jobs and revitalize communities, by: 

- Ending corporate welfare and focusing on job training to retain, promote, and attract businesses; 
- Expanding Baltimore County's innovative Job Connector program statewide; 
- Investing in our state's existing business assets, including cybersecurity, biotech, financial services, and health care sectors; 
- Targeting growth industries like Maryland-based clean energy and advanced manufacturing; 
- Raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour; and 
- Increasing opportunity by implementing thoughtful transportation strategies.",Yes. The inherently political gerrymandering process is unjustifiable and has helped contribute to the hyper-partisanship and gridlock we see in Washington. We must respect natural boundaries and keep communities together and I support efforts to ensure compact and contiguous districts.,"The goal of the original Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights (LEOBR) was to provide due process protections that law enforcement workers deserve without unfairly tipping the balance away from what the public should expect. Unfortunately, the current system is challenged by the current ""alternative hearing board"" amendment, which makes ""trial boards"" subject to collective bargaining negotiations, with inconsistent processes for different police agencies. The great strength of the original LEOBR was its uniformity and consistency, and we should eliminate the alternative hearing boards and let the General Assembly set a standard policy that every officer and every citizen understands and apply it uniformly.","Tragic deaths from opioid overdoses continue to skyrocket in communities across our state and we must do more to help those suffering from substance use disorder to stop loss of our loved ones to the disease of addiction. As governor, I will support bipartisan efforts to improve the ACA and take steps to end this public health crisis, by: 

- Increasing education efforts to end the stigma surrounding the disease of addiction; 
- Ensuring the opioid overdose reversal medication, naloxone, remains accessible and taking steps to keep it affordable; 
- Expanding access to evidence-based, on-demand treatment, so individuals can enter treatment as soon as they are ready; 
- Supporting police interdiction efforts to break the illegal networks that continue to funnel heroin, prescription opioids, and synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl, into our communities; and 
- Filing lawsuits against opioid manufacturers and distributors who have profited by misleading doctors into prescribing opioids for chronic pain.","Ensuring equal opportunity to success will produce more equitable outcomes across our state. No one working full time should be living in poverty. I support raising the state minimum wage to ensure Marylanders who work full time should never live in poverty. Maryland must also commit to advancing educational outcomes and ensuring more robust workforce development initiatives, which are critical drivers to address income inequality. These opportunities are the best, long-term approach to increase life-long earnings. And although the pay gap in Maryland is much lower than other states, there is more to be done to ensure wage parity. The National Partnership for Women & Families found that women in Maryland are paid 84 cents on the dollar compared to men — an almost $10,000 gap in the median salary between men and women. This gap is even more extreme for women of color. As governor, I will work with employers to create more pay transparency, and create a support system for women to fight pay discrimination.","While I think the State's Public Information Act provides appropriate levels of oversight, I would be open to discussing and considering additional ways to strengthen the Maryland's law because I believe that one of the most critical components to improving community relations is fostering trust through transparency. As Baltimore County Executive, we have consistently provided prompt responses to MPIA requests and have continued to translate more of the government experience online. In Baltimore County, I have utilized technology in all ways to better disseminate information more effectively, and our website was recently recognized as the one of the most informative in the nation. As governor, I would continue that commitment by ensuring state officials follow the Maryland Open Meetings Act and strengthen support for public information requests to provide additional levels of accountability for state government, and continue to invest in emerging technology to ensure that more aspects of state government are more readily available to the public for review.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

I am the only candidate who is a member of the Commission, and have worked hard to develop these recommendations. I am running to ensure that the recommendations are fully implemented. The five key recommendations provide a substantive blueprint for improving education and opportunity for all Maryland children, especially those with significant challenges: First, invest more in high-quality early childhood education, including full day preschool for all 4-year olds and all low-income 3-year olds; Second, significantly increase spending for at risk children, including those living in poverty; Third, increase compensation and support for educators, improve teacher education and preparation programs and raise certification standards - in short, elevate teaching into a high-status profession as it should be; Fourth, make college and career readiness a priority for all children, expanding pathways in high school to ensure every student graduates prepared for success - having taken college preparatory courses, earning college credits and/or participating in career and technical programs that lead to an industry-certified professional credential; Fifth, strengthen governance and accountability so that the public knows that our investments in schools are achieving results. As part of the budget adopted by the General Assembly this year we included $200 million dedicated to future investments to fund the Commission recommendations, a commitment I will build on to implement the recommendations. Maryland needs a committed Governor who truly believes in public education to implement these recommendations. I am running for Governor to make that happen. I will be the ""Education Governor"" Maryland needs.","I will build and maintain a strong statewide transportation system that gives people choices and opportunities for mobility, and keeps our environment healthy. Supporting effective, efficient public transit, faster, more reliable rail, better roads and safe bridges are essential for residents' quality of life and for economic and job growth. A proponent of transit, I led the way in securing $178 million for the Baltimore Metro system in this year's successful bill which funds the Washington Metro. I have been a strong supporter of the Red Line rail transit project to improve transit in Baltimore and its application to receive federal funding. Unfortunately, Governor Hogan's abrupt cancellation of the project and his withdrawal of its funding application means that the Red Line is not in line to receive critical federal funds. As governor I will direct the Department of Transportation to revive the Red Line and determine the most feasible, expeditious means of securing funding to improve transportation and support jobs and commerce in Baltimore. And the MARC commuter system must be improved with more frequent service and expansion. My vision for the transportation of the future includes long-term sustainable funding and the creation of regional transportation authorities to decide how best to fund, operate and maintain our transportation system. I fought to pass the Maryland Open Transportation Investment Decision Act that requires transparent decision-making for major transportation projects. As governor I will ensure that Maryland makes good transportation decisions which will result in better use of taxpayers' dollars.","Yes. I have been a leader in the effort to legalize marijuana in Maryland. We need to end the prohibition on marijuana and regulate and tax its sale in our state. During the 2017 legislative session, my bill proposed to legalize sales and possession of cannabis under specified circumstances and to impose a 9% excise tax on such sales (excluding sales of medical marijuana). The legislation dedicated half of the revenues for community schools in neighborhoods most impacted by the failed ""war"" on drugs, and the remainder for opioid prevention and treatment measures, workforce development, and public education and training regarding driving under the influence. As a result of my leadership in efforts to legalize marijuana, I received the 2017 Vanguard Award from the Maryland state chapter of the National Organization for Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML). This year I was a leader on the bill to put the question of legalization of marijuana for recreational use on the ballot. I support the legalization of medical marijuana and helped lead successful passage of the bill to fix the process for the implementation of and additional licenses for medical marijuana in Maryland. As Governor, I would appoint Commissioners who are committed to full realization of the goals of Maryland's medical marijuana laws and who would administer the program effectively. With appropriate staffing, funding and a commitment to diversity, we can run an effective program that makes medical marijuana available for all patients who could benefit from it.","Maryland must continue to be an active steward of the Chesapeake Bay. As governor I will be a strong leader and will protect, defend and improve the health of the Chesapeake Bay, one of Maryland's abundant natural treasures. To realize these goals of improving the health of the Chesapeake and its watershed, I will take action to reduce harmful runoff, maintain federal funding for Chesapeake Bay programs and increase funding for the Chesapeake and Atlantic Coastal Bays 2010 Fund which pays for projects to restore and improve the health of the Chesapeake Bay and its watersheds, to improve water quality and to control water pollution. I will be a strong leader who will engage in regional cooperative efforts with our neighboring states of Virginia and Pennsylvania to improve water quality and the health of the Chesapeake Bay and its oyster and crab population. My record of action to protect and improve the health of the Chesapeake Bay is extensive. When the Trump administration proposed eliminating funding for programs to protect the health of the Chesapeake Bay, I led efforts to restore federal funding for these programs which are so vital to a healthy, clean bay and successful state economy. I have been a key legislative voice and leader in the battle to clean up the Chesapeake. For the past five years, no legislator has been more aggressive and bold in seeking to increase funding to protect the Bay and holding the poultry industry accountable for their impact on the environment.","I believe that healthcare is a human right. I will be the strong leader Maryland needs to ensure that all Marylanders have broad access to affordable, high-quality health care. I fully support this year's initiative to provide a temporary reinsurance program to help cover the most expensive claims from people insured on the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange to stabilize health insurance rates now. Building on my legislative successes in improving Maryland's health care system and given the Republican repeal of the individual mandate under the Affordable Care Act, I strongly support a new health insurance down payment plan for uninsured Marylanders to provide coverage and to keep premiums affordable. I provided leadership for this year's bill to make prescription drugs affordable and to prevent price gouging by brand name drug companies in Maryland. Given generic drug companies' significant price increases for critical generic drugs, I fought for the 2017 law which prohibits price gouging by manufacturers or wholesale distributors in the sale of essential generic drugs in Maryland. I also worked to enact a law to provide Rx payment assistance to the elderly. When the Republicans in Congress threatened to cut off funding for Planned Parenthood, I successfully championed the law guaranteeing continued state funding for Planned Parenthood's health care services if the federal government terminates funding. For many Marylanders these clinics are a key source of primary health care, including cancer screening, preventive health and family planning services. Access to these essential services is now protected in Maryland.","The State of Maryland can and should play a role in helping Baltimore address violent crime. First, it is critical to rebuild trust and to improve the community's relationship with the Baltimore police force. Equally important is the realization that we can no longer merely ""police"" our way out of unacceptable levels of crime. The time has come to both implement effective law enforcement strategies while also addressing the systemic root causes underlying crime. I helped secure funds for diversion programs to keep those who are able to enter into these programs in Baltimore. As Governor my budget will include additional support for programs to assist Baltimore, including the Safe Streets program which the legislature funded this session, a community-based program that has produced results. I will provide additional state funding to help implement technology improvements and changes needed in the Baltimore police department to implement the Consent Decree between the Department of Justice and the City of Baltimore to improve policing. I will work with Baltimore to improve the community's relationship with the Baltimore police, including requiring body cameras for police officers, making sure we recruit a police force that is of Baltimore, changing how allegations of police misconduct are investigated, and improving the Law Enforcement Officers' Bill of Rights. I support providing smart policing training to establish effective communication and good working relationships with citizens and community leaders. When I am Governor the state will take action to help address violent crime in Baltimore.","Under my leadership Maryland will be ""Open to the Future"". I will improve Maryland's business climate and will vigorously pursue opportunities for greater economic development and the creation of more family-supporting jobs throughout our state, capitalizing on its many core competencies in technology, computers, security, analytics, food and manufacturing. I will keep good-paying jobs and bring new, good-paying jobs to Maryland. I will develop training programs and partnerships with our educational institutions so that Maryland workers have the skills companies need for the jobs of our future. I will fully fund Maryland's Partnership for Workforce Quality which funds training for employees in Maryland businesses, especially in the manufacturing and technology sector. I will support the state's growing renewable energy sector with targeted tax assistance, and support the development of 21st century jobs in construction, manufacturing and support services to serve the offshore wind energy project and to manufacture vessels to support offshore wind turbines locally and globally. My Lt Governor candidate, Luwanda Jenkins, a native Baltimorean with an extensive background and track record of state experience and results-driven accomplishments on behalf of Marylanders, especially the small, women and minority business community, served under Governor's Schaefer, Glendening and O'Malley as Special Secretary for the Governor's Office of Minority Affairs and advanced the state's minority business efforts. Luwanda's private and public experience and reputation as an effective, committed leader who delivers results combined with my successful legislative track record means we are the team ready to lead Maryland on day one.","Yes. I support redistricting reform. I supported and helped lead the 2017 bill passed by the General Assembly and vetoed by the General Assembly to establish a Temporary Redistricting Commission to prepare and adopt decennial redistricting plans for congressional districts in the State. This process was contingent on the enactment of a nonpartisan congressional redistricting process in the following mid-Atlantic region states: New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and North Carolina. In 2015 I supported a bill calling for a constitutional amendment requiring that each congressional district (1) consist of adjoining territory; (2) be compact in form; and (3) be of substantially equal population, giving due regard to natural and political boundaries. In 2005 I introduced legislation calling for a study commission to examine how Maryland draws legislative and congressional district maps and make recommendations to the Governor and to the General Assembly.","It is critical that the LEOBR appropriately balance protections for the police and public. Sadly, the events that have occured in Baltimore with the Gun Trace Task Force brings into question the effectiveness of the LEOBR. The legislature took steps this year to address the GTTF issue by creating the Commission to Restore Trust in Policing. While the Commission will be focused on Baltimore, its work may provide the seeds for policy development to address the disconnect between communities and those that ""protect and serve"". Certainly we don't want an oversight process that is arbitrary, capricious or unfair. We DO need to have a system that will ensure accountability is justly exercised and appropriately dispensed. The disconnect today between communities and law enforcement didn't just happen: it has taken years, and like any cultural change, will take time to improve. Most law enforcement personnel do the right thing everyday - and they should be honored for their service. But we need to think more strategically about how community and those that serve - not just law enforcement but any public servant - can come together with a shared sense of purpose and duty, working together, not separately. More ""doing with"", not ""doing to"". My administration will infuse this philosophy throughout. As Governor I will bring together the police, the public, and law enforcement professionals to find common sense reforms that improve our ability to make officers accountable and, where needed, impose discipline and/or removal of officers who have engaged in wrongful conduct.","Finding solutions to and preventing the spread of Maryland's opioid epidemic -- a problem that persists in the lives of many Marylanders -- requires a multi-faceted approach. To provide fast, effective relief for those suffering from addiction, and to find a long-term approach to stemming this crisis, I propose a new focus on prevention and treatment: Mandating medical profession and student education and training on i) non-opioid treatment and management of pain, ii) identification of substance use disorders, including how to detect opioid abuse, and (iii) options to secure assistance for patients. Further restricting the prescribing of opioids for treatment of pain, subject to exceptions, such as for cancer and palliative care. Enhanced monitoring of data reported through the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program to detect potential patterns of abuse or aberrant prescribing practices so that action can be taken. Creating a Director of Recovery to ensure a fully coordinated and comprehensive treatment and recovery support system. Creating sufficient Outreach Teams and Recovery Residences in Local Communities. Providing for sufficient Certified Peer Recovery Specialists to support patients and assist with connections to housing, transportation and employment. Ensuring that medication assisted treatment (MAT) and other long-term treatment, including mental health treatment, is available for those suffering from addiction, whether in the emergency room or in a prison. Ensuring that upon release from prison individuals are able to continue treatment through Medicaid eligibility and connection to community-based treatment. Enforcing mental health parity laws to ensure coverage for preventive services and addiction disorder treatment.","A growing economy must also be a just economy. Too many Marylanders work full-time but still live paycheck to paycheck, and the African American community is disproportionately impacted by an income inequality gap that we cannot ignore. I have led successful efforts to raise our state minimum wage and have been leading the fight for a much-needed $15-per-hour minimum wage, indexed to the cost of living so no one falls behind again. As Governor I will champion this legislation. Whether with his veto of the earned sick leave legislation or his opposition to the minimum wage, Larry Hogan stands in the way of progress for Maryland's working people. Building on past democratic administrations' impressive gains for the state's minority businesses through rigorous oversight, advocacy and access to level the playing field, a Madaleno-Jenkins administration's economic development focus will continue that progress and include minority businesses as a competitive advantage for growing the State's economy and ensuring that all communities benefit equitably. Maryland needs greater progressivity in its tax code. This year I was a leader in increasing the Maryland standard deduction to offset the negative impacts of the Republican federal tax bill for most lower and middle income taxpayers. I introduced successful legislation to expand the earned income tax credit for those under 25 years of age and to ""decouple"" our state estate tax from the federal estate tax given the significant increase in the federal estate tax exemption. Increasing the fairness of our taxes will help address income inequality.","I fully support our state's open meetings and freedom of information laws to ensure Marylanders' ability to know what actions their state government takes and to allow Marylanders to exercise oversight of their government. I will provide an open government which provides easy access to public information, including studies, permits and regulatory violations; easy access to public meetings; and that engages in transparent decision making. In order to fully realize the goals of these laws, as Governor I would provide training to all my appointees on how to best implement and achieve full compliance with open meetings and information laws. I would also act to ensure that my administration implements web streaming of public meetings by our state agencies wherever feasible, and provides ready access to public information, including records supporting state decisions, in electronic form wherever possible -- consistent with the law I introduced which maintains public access to public records in electronic format.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

,YES,governor,Alec Ross,Ross,11/30/1971,Baltimore,Democratic,"I am a proud product of public schools in West Virginia. I then went on to get my undergraduate degree from Northwestern University in Chicago, Illinois. Immediately after that, I came to Baltimore City as a public school teacher, and that's when I believe the most important part of my education truly began.","1994-96 - Baltimore City Public School teacher, 6th grade, Booker T.

Education is the starting point for addressing nearly every societal need, and for that reason, we must prioritize equitable, innovative educational programs for our children. I believe we have a budget that we can make work and our first priority should always be to use existing resources. We have a $43.4 billion budget and the distribution of that budget and how it relates to the funding of schools must be reviewed and possibly redistributed. In addition, we must continue to take steps to make sure that dedicated funding sources, like casino revenues, actually reach our schools. At times, Maryland has had some of the highest performing schools in the country, but we have persistent inequities in many of our districts that severely disadvantage students. To realize excellence at all of our public schools, we must develop plans to improve our schools that are customized to meet the their specific needs. It's not just about investing more in public schools. It's about investing smarter. We need to account for special circumstances in school districts with high levels of poverty. We need to make sure our schools are equipped with high-speed Internet access and technology for the classroom. And we need to properly compensate and reward our teachers.","To begin, let me be clear: my policies would be focused on mass transit, as opposed to expanding highway transit. This is clearly not the stance of our current governor, given his multi-billion dollar highway expansion plan. We need a multimodal transportation plan for the entire state, and Baltimore region in particular, that connects all our jurisdictions to each other and the nearby states, as well as provides local solutions that increase quality of life in all communities. Right now, our transportation system just isn't working for everyone. In Baltimore, cancelling the Red Line rail project was something that I completely disagree with. We need a transportation solution for all parts of Baltimore City, and Hogan's decision to cancel this project is just one example of how he does not prioritize equity for all Marylanders. I would advocate for and implement a transit solution similar to the Red Line for Baltimore. As part of a multimodal approach, I would also work closely with local leaders and transportation organizations to make sure we are including other modes of transport in our plans, like walking and biking. In terms of measurable outcomes, I would look seriously at commute times, which are a tremendous tax on Marylanders and sap productivity and quality of life. It is still the case in Baltimore City that the length of your commute time directly correlates to your economic wellbeing. This should not be the case.","It is high time for Maryland to adopt progressive marijuana policies. The social and economic benefits of taxing and regulating a legal market for marijuana are a clear win for the state and redress a legacy of failed drug policies. That is why I have already released comprehensive policy outlining how we would go about legalizing and regulating recreational marijuana in Maryland. Legalization and the expungement of the records of those with past marijuana convictions are also morally the right thing to do, recognizing and reversing many years of discriminatory criminal justice policies that have disproportionately burdened minority communities. The plan I outline follows a tried and tested path toward legalization that has worked in other states and won the support of many legislators in Annapolis — not to mention a majority of their constituents. Marijuana must no longer be a scourge in our communities that sustains a black market of criminal enterprise nearly $800 million in size. It is time to bring it all under the rule of law — drawing an estimated windfall of $200-300 million in tax revenue, creating jobs, and helping thousands of Marylanders get their lives back out from under the shadow of a criminal record.","The Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure, teeming with life and providing economic and recreational benefits estimated at $33 billion a year. Protecting it is essential for our environment and economy. My Administration will prioritize cleaning up and preserving the Chesapeake Bay. It's especially important that our next Governor fight to protect the Bay in light of Trump and EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt's attempts to slash funding for Bay cleanup. As Governor, I will support the Chesapeake Bay Program where Maryland works cooperatively with other state and local governments, as well as with the federal government to clean up the Bay. I will also support the Chesapeake Clean Water Blueprint and implementation of Maryland's Watershed Implementation Plans and related pollution reduction targets. Additionally, I will invest in solutions to help clean up the Chesapeake Bay that harness advances in technology, innovation, and citizen engagement, like the Chesapeake Conservancy's Conservation Innovation Center, which uses cloud-based data analysis techniques to more effectively identify conservation opportunities. We will make Maryland the center of the green economy and provide funding for environmental innovators by establishing a statewide Maryland Green Bank. Finally, to clean the Chesapeake Bay, we have to support farmers. In 2016, nearly one-third of Maryland's total land area was used for agriculture, the largest commercial industry in Maryland, which supports roughly 350,000 jobs. As Governor, I will advocate for increases in technical and financial assistance to help farmers implement conservation practices to increase their efficiency, reduce pollution, and preserve natural resources.","Without extending health coverage to all Marylanders, we are denying quality of life to many in our state and increasing health care costs for everyone. This is something we must do immediately. To begin with, we must play good defense and then launch a good offense to make sure Marylanders are able to access the health care they need. As a starting point, we need to protect and preserve the best parts of the ACA. We also need to add a public option through Medicaid so that everyone in Maryland has access to quality, affordable health care. This is an important step we can take in Annapolis, and we do not need the support of the federal government to do so, and I would push for such an option wholeheartedly. I have no confidence in this Congress to add a federal public option, so as Governor I will commit to working with the legislature to establish a state run public option. We also need to continue to fight to reduce the cost of prescription drugs. The House and Senate were right to pass HB 631, allowing Attorney General Brian Frosh to go after pharmaceutical companies accused of price gouging. As Governor, I would support the Maryland Attorney General's office and work with our congressional delegation and others to fight for common-sense legislation to make drug prices more affordable for Maryland families.","The state must work hand-in-hand with Baltimore City's local government to develop and implement a holistic plan to address violent crime. At the state level, we can help address this issue from many perspectives, beginning with making sure we are not making it easy for guns to flow through our state. For example, Maryland--with a few exceptions--does not let localities regulate firearms. If places like Baltimore want to set higher standards than Maryland law currently permits, they should be able to. Maryland as a state should establish a ""floor"", not a ceiling. In addition, we must empower our police officers to be part of the community, not aggravants of it, by promoting community policing methods. The way that we reduce violent crime is by empowering more officers to engage on the ground with community members, and also equipping key community actors, like teachers and health care providers, in the best way possible to do their jobs so that issues like poverty and inequality are not continually perpetuated.","Our current governor likes to claim that Maryland is ""open for business,"" when in all reality, we are not doing enough to support our state's innovators and business owners, especially when compared to our neighboring states who work every day to poach our businesses. We are too focused on the 'Amazons' of the world, and not on supporting the small and medium-sized businesses that form the backbone of our economy. My running mate, Julie Verratti, is acutely aware of the challenges that face business owners, given that she is the co-founder of Denizens Brewing in Silver Spring. Together, we are focused on supporting and growing homegrown innovators. This is the key way to increase the amount of good jobs in our state and attract the kind of investment that will lead to many more. I have also proposed a $1B investment in inclusive innovation that will ensure that workers in our state are able to compete and succeed in an ever-evolving technological economy. The objective is to accelerate the integration of technology and innovation into every sector of economy by dramatically expanding the number of tech-savvy workers in Maryland. We will focus especially on the more than 50 percent of Marylanders without a college degree. What we are missing is a set of institutions that are designed to deliver specific skills quickly, affordably, and credibly — working with industries — so that people earn credentials that are connected to actual skills and translate into jobs. We can close this gap.","We need to make the modification of Congressional districts a process conducted by independent commissions that rely on the fairness of mathematics rather than the bias of politics. Among the damaging effects of hyper-partisanship in America is the rise in the practice of gerrymandering. Here in Maryland, we have been debating gerrymandering for years. The map redrawn in 2010 by a Democratic administration is still under judicial review. And some of its architects have subsequently called for independent commissions. The Supreme Court will soon decide the question of whether it is Constitutional to redraw district lines for the advantage of one party over another regardless of its impact on accurate representation of the voters in Congress or the state legislature. Whatever the outcome of that case, Maryland should set a standard of independent commissions that seek to deliver a fair and reasonable representation for all voters. Additionally, we need to set up a commission of leading election reform experts tasked with studying the problems of voter choice and political polarization and making recommendations for the state. One possibility to get at this problem is to open up our primaries to all voters. And another promising option is Rank Choice Voting (also known as Instant Runoff Voting). On its face, this is a logical step toward real change that doesn't fundamentally alter our elections. It is simple and it will bring more competition into our politics and more choices for voters.","We must do everything we can to both empower and protect police officers, while also making sure that they are never above the law or not held responsible for non-permitted or illegal actions taken while doing their jobs (or outside of it). The current Bill of Rights for officers has not changed much since the 1970s when it was instituted, and I believe there are some ways that it could be made more current and applicable to our climate in 2018. We must have civilians on all review boards for incidents of misconduct by officers. This is just common sense and it an agency we need to give to citizens. And we must have independent civilian review boards to help us hold officers accountable by those they serve. We can't cut corners on background checks, and if there are loopholes we need to close, we have to do it. We also must continue to evaluate how complaints are filed against officers and if anonymous complaints are something that we should empower citizens to make. And these complaints must be investigated promptly. As with all other aspects of our government, openness about the actions of our police force indicates the health of our law enforcement in the state.","As governor, I would support services and solutions that treat the opioid crisis as what it truly is: a public health crisis. We must prioritize inter-agency cooperation so we can address this crisis from all sides, be it in our education systems, state-run healthcare providers, and even in how we treat and train those recovering from opioid addiction as they look to re-enter employment and normal living. If we treat the crisis this way, then there is no reason to be de-funding or privatizing state-run service providers working to address this issue. I believe that we also encourage non-opioid pain treatment methods, including medical marijuana, that are coming to market, as pain treatment is a major runway into opioid abuse. I would work with our legislators and state departments to address this crisis from all sides.","My run for governor is animated by a belief that talent is everywhere and opportunity is not and that here in Maryland, we need to work to change that. This is about taking a holistic approach to issues of inequality that have always plagued our society and making our state the most inclusive and equitable in the country. I've released detailed education policy that outlines programs that will help more Marylanders enter the economic mainstream. I want to make Maryland the white hot center of the skilled trades, training many non-college-goers and those making mid-career transitions to work in high demand, high-paying fields. Additionally, that policy also calls for an expansion of the community schools model, which has proven to be the most effective public school model for helping to lift children and families out of poverty. I have also released detailed policy on child care, calling for new funding models that make child care more accessible to all Marylanders, given how formative it is for children and their future success. We also cannot ignore that we still have incredible equal pay issues, with women making around $0.80 to the dollar compared to men, and African-American women making even less. It should be the case that we are leading the way in equality, and passing legislation to close the wage gap is a great place to start, as well as focus on communities of color and other disenfranchised groups.","I am a firm believer that our openness in government is a key indicator of how healthy our democracy is. There is always more we can do, and I have been on the front lines of government transparency throughout my public service career. I was the first person responsible for President Obama's Open Government Initiative, focused on making all government info open, machine-readable, and available in real time. I want to do the same in Maryland. Sunlight is always the best disinfectant. Another example from my time in the Obama administration that I would like to see done in Maryland is his ""We the People"" website that allowed any American to introduce a petition and gather electronic signatures on the White House website. Once a petition reached 100,000 signatures, the White House would review and respond. A petition system like this can help amplify ordinary citizens' voices. And it can help bring greater accountability for elected officials to respond to the voters. As Governor, I will implement a ""Governor's Petition Pledge"" and commit to responding to any petition that garners at least 5,000 electronic signatures from Marylanders. I know this will be another great tool for Marylanders to engage with their public officials, especially their governor. Lastly, it's hard to believe that in 2018, Marylanders can't simply go online and watch all the proceedings of the government they have paid for, but it's true. As Governor, I will call on the legislature to livestream all votes and committee hearings.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

We need to examine the historical circumstances that have created disparities in all measurable outcomes, including health and education. Success in business and development must come because we have eliminated disparities in the way Marylanders are educated, not despite those disparities. We must make it clear that we are willing to cut investment in development projects (especially private development projects aided by public subsidies) and re-invest those funds in the basic task of educating students. We will thrive in business and development only after each student is funded to their full potential, and until that goal is reached the state cannot defend spending on huge private development projects.","Maryland's transportation infrastructure is unbalanced, with an emphasis on car transportation on roads and a neglect of mass transit on rails and other means, such as walking and bicycle paths. Road construction and maintenance expenses should be decreased and shifted to new rail construction. The District of Columbia and Baltimore should be connected efficiently by expanding and connecting both cities' mass transit system. The BaltimoreLink system has not sufficiently expanded Baltimore's public transit infrastructure. The Baltimore Metro and Light Rail systems should be expanded to provide more access to workplaces, dense housing areas and entertainment and tourist destinations. Cities should be encouraged to develop dedicated bicycle lanes and establish downtown car-free zones. Once funding is shifted from new road construction and expensive upkeep of existing roads to mass transit and green transit systems, sufficient funds will exist to establish a balanced, effective transportation infrastructure.","Yes. We must end the failed ""War on Drugs"" by legalizing marijuana and decriminalizing the use of other drugs. Drug abuse and addiction must be treated as a public health crisis, not a criminal activity. Treatment must be emphasized over arrest and imprisonment. Ending arrests for marijuana sales will drastically decrease street violence. Legalizing and taxing marijuana sales will create a huge influx of new public money, as has happened in Colorado and other jurisdictions. There is no reason to continue the failed war on marijuana, and there are many benefits to legalizing it for recreational purposes. It's important to recognize that many millionaires seem to want to cash in on the gold rush of legal taxed and regulated cannabis. Yet former sellers who were caught and served their time are not able to raise the funds to sell it legally. We must not ignore the damage done by illegal cannabis, and the war on black, brown and poor people that have come from it. The law must serve those that were selling it illegally that now want to be become entrepreneurs and sell it legally. We must expunge the records of those that were charged previously. We must work to release those currently in the criminal justice system for marijuana related charges. That is remediation, and while it is necessary it is not enough. We need reparations using proceeds from legally taxed cannabis to invest in those that were criminalized and most directly targeted by the war on drugs.","We must prioritize the safety of Maryland's natural resources and people over the corporate bottom line. One of the largest threats to the Chesapeake Bay are under-regulated agricultural industries, particularly the chicken industry. We must demand and enforce real restrictions on pollution, runoff of nitrogen and phosphorus, and other damaging agricultural practices. We need to be ready to implement real enforcement mechanisms on polluting companies, including the revocation of corporate charters of companies that refuse to prioritize the health of the Bay over their profits. We must permanently ban natural gas drilling in or near the Chesapeake Bay, and we must defend the ban on hydraulic fracturing (fracking) in Maryland. We can power every Maryland home and business with clean, renewable energy - and put tens of thousands of Marylanders to work - if we commit to building an energy infrastructure of 100% renewable energy and dump gas and oil extraction plans.","We have to abandon efforts to tinker with the private health insurance system and put private insurance companies out of business. Maryland can and should implement a universal, single-payer health care system under which every Marylander is provided health care coverage beginning at birth. Similarly to how all Americans over a certain age are entitled to Medicare coverage that provides a basic level of coverage, state governments can ensure that their residents are entitled to a basic level of coverage regardless of their age, employment, or ability to pay out of pocket. Maryland has several world-renowned hospitals, and Marylanders should be entitled to an adequate level of care at any of them regardless of their wealth. Activists from every state have worked for decades on creating a universal, single-payer system (also called ""Medicare-for-All"") and we can utilize this knowledge and experience to develop an affordable system that can work for Maryland.","We believe that many violent crimes are a reaction to conditions of hopelessness and despair. We will work to address hopelessness and despair by working toward justice wherever possible. We will work for environmental justice by targeting polluting industries and companies who have turned once-thriving neighborhoods in Baltimore into waste dumps. We will work to create health justice by promoting universal, single-payer health care for all Marylanders, so no one has to act out of desperation of being sick and unable to afford care. We will work for economic justice by establishing a universal basic income so that every Marylander can afford basic housing, food, and necessities regardless of their employment. We will work for economic justice by challenging corporations that look to exploit communities by taking their land, homes, and resources in search of profits. We will work for economic justice by protecting and expanding affordable public housing. We will end the threats many communities perceive against them by ending the failed ""War on Drugs"" and redirecting state resources toward treatment of drug abuse and addiction.","Maryland's business climate is great - for big business. Governor Hogan's emphasis is on protecting and promoting the concerns of international, multi-billion dollar conglomerates. He has worked to stall pollution regulations that would have affected Perdue Farms, written Marriott International into his public budget, and is currently dangling $5 billion in incentive packages in front of Amazon. Governor Hogan subscribes to a ""corporate headquarters"" model that pumps public money into the very top levels of large corporations. We believe in a community wealth-building model. As a small business owner, I understand how small businesses work together to keep our dollars in our communities, not sheltered in off-shore accounts or tax-friendly corporate havens. One way Maryland can promote community wealth building is by creating a requirement for large institutions to consider local businesses when seeking bids on contracts. We know that large institutions tend to consider big businesses first when looking for vendors out of habit and because the Governor likes to promote big businesses. We will always look to build community wealth by investing in small businesses before we offer huge incentive packages to big businesses.","Yes. Governor O'Malley's shameful defense of drawing Democrat-friendly districts in 2010 is a stain on Maryland's commitment to free and fair elections that must be remedied. As a technology consultant, I understand how to utilize technological resources to solve organizational problems. There are many technological methods for drawing fair and impartial legislative and Congressional districts, and we can easily do this job without relying on impartial political operatives to play games with our voting districts.","The Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights goes too far in shielding some members of the police force. As a Baltimorean, it is disturbing to hear about repeated abuses of power by a segment of the police force that has decided that it is not subject to the laws it has sworn to enforce. Police need to be held to the same standards as civilians when they are suspected of having broken the law and are being investigated for a crime. We understand that some activities of the police need to be kept private, just as a civilian working in computer programming or some other pursuit of intellectual property might need to keep aspects of their work secret. This does not mean that basic information about who is being accused of wrongdoing should be withheld, or that a person being accused of a crime should be granted long periods of silence during which they are not required to answer questions from their fellow police officers. We believe that civilian reviews boards are vital to public oversight of the police force, and they ought to be granted further powers to take binding action against police after a thorough, public process is complete. Rebuilding public trust between police and the public is crucial to addressing violent crime on the streets of Baltimore and other cities throughout Maryland, and we cannot rebuild trust as long as some untrustworthy police officers use tools to shield themselves from accountability for their conduct.","The first step to addressing the opioid crisis and fighting addiction is to starting thinking about the drug crisis as a public health problem, not a criminal problem. We have to stop treating people experiencing drug addiction as criminals and start treating them as our neighbors in need of compassion and help. The tools we use to solve criminal problems are not doing the job. Arresting and jailing people isn't helping them become healthy. Buying more and bigger guns for police to make more and bigger raids is creating a street arms race that puts both civilians and police at risk. Filling prisons with low and mid-level drug offenders is displacing entire communities from their families, creating more desperation, and perpetuating the cycle of crime and violence. We need to create an environment in which people experiencing addiction feel safe admitting their struggles and seeking help. We need to invest less in militarizing police and more in equipping doctors, hospitals, and community health centers with what they need to house and treat people looking to escape addiction. We will re-distribute state funds provided to local police forces (such as the State Aid for Police Protection Fund, which provided over $67 million in state funds to local police forces in 2016) to build a robust program for providing support and treatment for Marylanders experiencing addiction.","I have worked for many years to promote a universal basic income (or basic income guarantee) which is a program designed to provide each citizen within a jurisdiction with a regular liveable income regardless of their age or employment status. All Americans over the age of 67 are already provided a type of universal basic income, which is called Social Security. I want Social Security expanded to all adults in Maryland, and I want everyone to receive the same livable income. Many cities and provinces throughout the world have experimented with a basic income guarantee, and I will work to institute such a guarantee in Maryland. We can ensure that every Marylander is provided enough for a safe place to live, sufficient food to stay healthy, and basic services like electricity and water. Once their basic needs are met, people will have more time and freedom to work to pay for luxuries, go to school if they want to learn new skills, or start a business. We also believe that income equality results from the prioritization of corporate interests over that of communities and individuals. We will no longer allow companies to exploit Maryland's natural resources, which includes its neighborhoods and people. Simply: corporations are only allowed to do business if their corporate charter is approved and renewed by the state. If we believe that a corporation is no longer working in the best interests of the state, my administration will revoke that corporation's charter and right to do business.","Maryland's existing public information and open meetings laws are generally satisfactory for individuals who are motivated to exercise oversight of government, but we believe that full civic engagement requires more of a commitment than simply making meetings and documents available to the public. As a technology consultant, I understand the incredible power technology has to make civic activities more accessible and attractive to Marylanders. We can encourage more people to get involved in decision-making by harnessing the power of streaming video, online discussion tools, and social media. We can make decision-making not only accessible but attractive to a new generation who aren't excited by quarterly meetings held in high school auditoriums. Our government will function best only when everyone is interested in participating through whatever tools they are comfortable with.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

,YES,governor,Jim Shea,Shea,6/19/1952,Owings Mills,Democratic,I am a lifelong Marylander. I attended Baltimore County Public Schools before going to boarding school. I graduated from Princeton University in 1974 and the University of Virginia School of Law in 1977.,"Throughout my career, I have led large public and private organizations across the state. For four years, I was the Chair of the University System of Maryland, and I served on the board for ten years. I have also served as Chair of the Empower Baltimore Management Corporation, the Central Maryland Transportation Alliance, and the Downtown Partnership of Baltimore. And, for 22 years, I served as Chairman of Venable LLP, the state's largest law firm. After graduating from law school, I worked as an Assistant Attorney General in Maryland.",Brandon M. Scott,https://www.JimShea.com,sheaforMD,SheaforMD,http://surveygizmoresponseuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/fileuploads/296249/4255081/253-79100d6890050b17bd8b1d93d126da51_JLSHeadshot.jpeg,"I fully support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education. It has found that results of Maryland's public education system fall in the middle of the pack when compared to other states across the country. Last year, I released a comprehensive education plan that addresses issues from universal pre-k through institutions of higher education. We need universal pre-k, because we know that educational inequity currently cements itself before children step foot in a classroom. We need to institute a curriculum that is benchmarked against international standards, and we need to put that curriculum in the hands of well-trained and compensated educators. We need to develop a new funding formula that properly accounts for areas of concentrated poverty and funds additional community schools. And, we need to provide more Marylanders with access to job training programs and higher education opportunities. Many of these priorities, which I outlined last year, are mirrored in the findings of the Kirwan Commission. Yes, some of these initiatives will cost money. As I construct my budget each year, I will do so with properly funding education as my highest priority. Governor Hogan has funded education at a lower rate than general fund growth, so prioritizing education in the budget will help to fund these policy proposals. Further, there are other potential sources of revenue, including the legalization and taxation of cannabis and sports gambling. Finally, rolling in the lockbox for the casino revenue will add additional money to properly fund public education.","Under the Hogan Administration, Maryland's transportation spending has not been anywhere close to appropriately balanced. Governor Hogan's transportation decisions have involved taking credit for a Purple Line project that previous administrations planned and conceived. He cancelled the Red Line, forfeiting almost one billion dollars back to the federal government. Not only would the Red Line have provided a transit lifeline to those who live and work in East and West Baltimore, but it would have also created a transit spine upon which other lines or spurs could be built. Baltimore's consolation from the Hogan Administration was BaltimoreLink, which caused significant upheaval and confusion but does not significantly reduce commute times or improve transportation in the city. No, the Baltimore region is not adequately served by transit. That is why, in the transportation plan I released last year, I proposed developing a replacement to the Red Line that moves people across the city. I also proposed an expansion to MARC services that will serve the Baltimore area, as well as a bus system that then properly complements the larger transit systems. None of these proposals will happen overnight. First, we need a statewide plan, and we need to know our priorities so that when funding opportunities present themselves, like, for example, a major federal infrastructure package, we have everything ready to go. We also need to be willing to invest in long-term projects that will create jobs, grow our economy, and improve the quality of life of our state.","Yes, I support the legalization, regulation, and taxation of recreational marijuana. As other jurisdictions across the country, including Colorado, Massachusetts, and Washington, D.C. have recognized, legalizing marijuana is an issue of criminal justice and economic equality. Not only will it create a more just society, but it will also provide the state with additional resources to deliver more robust services to citizens. Further, I support developing a systematic approach that will expunge previous marijuana sentences, and I will look into programs, like the one in Oakland, California, that mandate that half of the licenses go to those who were previously convicted of cannabis-related offenses.","Maryland, with our way of life and economy so strictly tied to a healthy environment, has a fundamental interest in protecting the Chesapeake Bay. When the federal government fails to act to protect and restore the Chesapeake Bay, my Administration will fill the void. The state must be a leader in promoting environmentally-friendly practices, incentivizing growth in renewable energy, and reducing pollution that soils the air we breathe and the water we drink. As Governor, I will roll out a new transportation vision for the state that gets people out of their cars and onto mass transit lines. Studies continually show that passenger vehicles are a major polluter. I will create ambitious targets for our renewable portfolio standard, create an incentive structure that supports renewable energy growth, and invest in our state's energy storage capacity. Finally, I will work with both the environmental and agricultural community to identify ways that the two groups can continue to work together to limit the runoff of damaging toxins, while also developing practices that give our agriculture sector room to grow and flourish.","Maryland has, for decades, been a leader in expanding the availability of quality and affordable health care. On the federal level, President Obama's signature achievement, the Affordable Care Act, has significantly expanded access to health care in Maryland. As Governor, I will be a staunch advocate for Obamacare and stand up against any and all efforts to repeal it or lessen its impact. Further, at the federal level, the winds seem to be shifting towards a single payer system, which I support. I will advocate for further federal reform, but I do not believe that the state of Maryland can implement its own single payer system. It is simply too expensive for one state to do so alone, as California and Vermont have both found as well. Instead, I will look for changes we can make at the state level to increase access to quality and affordable care. Throughout my career, I have worked with each of the interested parties in our health care system: patients, doctors, hospitals, and insurers. I will bring each of these groups to the table to find ways to improve our system. One area, for example, that I think we can improve is access to primary care physicians. Doing so would prioritize preventative care tactics that keep health care costs down. It will also give more Marylanders consistent relationships with doctors who are able to develop longer-term strategies to keep patients healthy.","The state has a very large role to play in helping Baltimore address violent crime. There are several different entities, including the state police, corrections, and parole and probation, and the Baltimore City Police Department, that fall under State jurisdiction. We must focus the State's resources on targeting the city's most violent offenders, a large percentage – fully one third – of whom are in the parole and probation systems. The State also must work with local jurisdictions across the state, especially Baltimore City, to implement policies that will help to reduce crime. Along with my Lt. Governor Brandon Scott, we will invest in programs like Safe Streets, which have a proven track record and can be expanded. We will expand group violence reduction and community mediation programs. We will develop a statewide gun violence prevention database that properly and functionally tracks important metrics. And, we will facilitate the sharing of information between the Governor's Office of Crime Control and Prevention and the Maryland State Police and local jurisdictions. In the long-term, in order to fully address the issue of crime in Maryland, we must identify and correct the underlying causes. We must properly invest in education to give every one of Maryland's children, regardless of their zip code, a proper education. We must work to expand economic opportunities for Marylanders, especially those in distressed communities. And, we must do a better job connecting Marylanders, wherever they may live, with the jobs and opportunities that are available in the state.","Maryland has all of the assets it needs to have the strongest economy in the United States. However, I do not think we are capitalizing on our assets, nor are we making the proper, targeted, and necessary investments in crucial economic development drivers like education, infrastructure, and small business. In order to foster the creation of more family-supporting jobs, I will build bridges between the economic assets we have in our state, including the federal research institutions, our colleges and universities, and our business leaders. I will properly prioritize our public education system, because a strong labor force is the backbone of an economy. I will invest in new infrastructure projects, particularly transit infrastructure, that will create jobs, reduce congestion, and improve the economic attractiveness of our state. And, I will work to support our state's small businesses by making our state government systems more efficient and looking for ways to provide them with the necessary access to capital.",I support the creation of a bipartisan and independent body to advise during the redistricting process. I will also work to create a more transparent process to provide additional measures of accountability so that the public can be assured that the process is honest and fair.,"In order to truly address the crime and violence that is so pervasive across our state, including in Baltimore, we must devise a plan that ends the violence and restores the community's trust in law enforcement. To accomplish the crucial second goal, we should ensure that people are properly held accountable. The Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights provides us with one area in which we can make some changes to restore community trust in law enforcement. For example, I support efforts to involve the public more closely with disciplinary decisions and allow them to serve and vote on trial boards. Further, I think that there are other steps, including limiting the number of days officers can go between an incident and providing testimony, that will improve transparency and paint a cleaner picture of the incident. And, we can make police misconduct investigations more transparent by ensuring that those who file a complaint of police misconduct are able to access information on how the department investigates or resolves the case.","The opioid epidemic has run rampant across Maryland for far too long. Still, deaths due to overdose have continued to rise over the past three years. As Governor, I will develop a well-funded and well-conceived plan to address this crisis head-on. We will expand the prevalence of and access to community health centers across the state that treat victims and prioritize continuity of care. My Department of Health will work with local jurisdictions to develop a system that properly treats each patient according to their needs. l will ensure that naloxone is readily available, and that first responders across the state have naloxone on-site. I will make sure that people have access to treatment in our state's prisons and jails. And, finally, I will work with local jurisdictions to make sure they have the resources they need to confront the crisis on the ground.","I will grow our economy and give hardworking Marylanders opportunities they deserve. To do that, we will build on our strengths and ensure that more Marylanders can benefit from our institutional advantages. We will prioritize public education, which is continually proven to be the surest ladder of opportunity. Today's small businesses and start-ups are often developed by Marylanders who honed their skills in the classroom. We will invest in infrastructure and our small businesses. And, we will create an energy economy that incentivizes growth in renewable sources, which will become increasingly important as we move further into the 21st century economy. This growth will give more Marylanders more opportunities for success. However, while we work to grow the economy, we also must work to make it fairer. As Governor, I will push for legislation that institutes a statewide $15 minimum wage and work to expand the state's Child Care Subsidy Program. In the long-term, I believe that, in order to really address income inequality, we need to fix our state's public education and transportation systems. We will not provide every Marylander with the chance to succeed and with the opportunity for long-term, steady, and fulfilling careers if we do not provide every Marylander with an adequate education. And, if we continue to isolate communities across the state by failing to provide them with access to public transit, they will not have access to good-paying jobs that are available. In order to address income inequality, each of these areas is crucial.","Public Information Act and Open Meetings Laws are crucial to ensuring our government is accountable to the people it is designed to serve. As Governor, I will ensure that Public Information Act and Open Meetings Laws are always properly adhered to. If they are not being adhered to consistently, or if the laws are not strong enough to provide the public with the information they need, then I will work to change them.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

,YES,governor,Krish O'Mara Vignarajah,Vignarajah,9/16/1979,Gaithersburg,Democratic,"I'm a proud Maryland's public school kid. I attended Edmonson Heights Elementary, Woodbridge Elementary, Johnnycake Middle School, and Woodlawn High School.  In fact, I'm the only candidate running for governor who attended Maryland public schools from kindergarten through 12th grade.  After Woodlawn, I attended Yale College and graduated with a Master's degree in Political Science & a B.S. in Molecular Biology.  I received a Marshall Scholarship to attend Oxford University and study International Relations. I completed my law degree at Yale Law School.","I have had the privilege to work at the highest levels of business and government.   Most recently, I served as the Policy Director for Michelle Obama in the White House, where I led the Obama's signature multi-billion dollar Let Girls Learn initiative and managed different initiatives related to veterans, nutrition, and education.  I previously served as a senior policy advisor in State Department under Secretaries Clinton and Kerry, where I helped develop and oversee the Department's $51.6 billion budget and led programs in private sector investment, infrastructure, entrepreneurship, women's issues, engagement with youth and religious communities, and climate change.  Before joining the government, I gained valuable private sector experience by consulting for Fortune 100 companies with McKinsey and Company, practicing law at Jenner & Block, and teaching courses on International Relations as an Adjunct Professor at Georgetown University.

Blake,https://www.krishformaryland.com,krishformaryland,krishformd,http://surveygizmoresponseuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/fileuploads/296249/4255081/117-75abfb0882df46d66c25fb582513d290_Krish_Headshot.jpg,"My absolute top priority is fully funding our schools and implementing the Kirwan Commission's recommendations. I'm the only candidate who is a product of Maryland public schools from K-12. I'm the daughter of two Baltimore City public school teachers and my running mate, Sharon Blake, was a lifelong public school teacher and former Baltimore Teachers Union President. 

I personally lived through many of the problems we're still facing today, such as trying to learn in sweltering heat or freezing cold in so-called temporary trailers that still remain today or watching my parents struggle on their teachers' salary, but still pay for classroom supplies and food for students that the school couldn't afford.

I support fully funding the Commission's recommendation. As Governor, I will build the full additional state-share of $1.9 billion into my first budget. I also strongly support the Commission's recommendations of raising educator pay, elevating the status of the teaching profession, and investing in universal pre-K and STEM education. This is ultimately about closing the opportunity gap and ensuring every child realizes their full potential. 

To ensure full funding, I will: 

1. Reduce costs elsewhere, such as displacing mass-incarceration with drug treatment; 
2. Raise revenues by increasing taxes on vices/pollution; 
3. Close loopholes in tax code; 
4. Dedicate gambling revenues towards education; 
5. Renovate schools to improve energy/water efficiency and redirect savings back into schools; 
6. Secure outside funding for investments that pay for themselves through long-term savings, like pre-K; 
7. Generate new revenues from private-sector jobs growth.","We must provide both safe roads and efficient transit. This is personal, because when my family immigrated to Maryland, we couldn't afford a car for several years. If it wasn't for the buses along Route 40, my dad couldn't have gotten to his job teaching at Edmonson High. Indeed, for many Marylanders, transit is the gateway to opportunity.

Today, we have a 1950s transportation system that spends twice as much on roads as on transit—and the results are disastrous. Marylanders spend 74 hours in traffic annually and lose $1,500 in lost wages and wasted gas. At the same time, the deficiencies in public transit are a root cause of poverty, crime, and the lack of opportunity.

My administration is committed to cutting commute times in half by investing in both roads and transit. Greater Baltimore contains almost half of the state's residents, yet receives only a fraction of transportation funding. Rather than spending $9 billion to create a few luxury lanes, while the rest of suffer with near-term construction and no long-term benefit, my administration will adopt a different approach and base decisions upon equity considerations:

1.	Build the Red Line: My administration will restart the Red Line on my first day.

2.	Fix the BaltimoreLink: The routes, frequency, and reliability all have to be rethought.

3.	Reduce congestion: Add reversible lanes, improve light timing, and improve interchanges.

4.	Develop complete streets: Work with communities to build safe, complete streets, including separated bike lanes.","I support the legalization, regulation, and taxation of marijuana for medical and recreational purposes.

Legalizing medical marijuana has tangible public health benefits, like creating significant reductions in the number of opioid-related overdoses. Further, the taxation of marijuana could become an important source of revenue to fund education in Maryland, but the cultivation and sale of cannabis also needs careful regulation and fair competition for licenses to ensure that people of color are not shutout from the potential economic opportunities.

Ultimately, I believe we need to treat drug use as a public health issue not a criminal one. This philosophy guides my approach to liberalization measures. We need policy that sensibly follows the evidence, rather than the drug enforcement dogma that too often penalizes our most vulnerable communities due to their ethnic, racial, or socioeconomic status.","""The Chesapeake Bay is Maryland's most precious natural resource. At a time when the Trump Administration has tried to defund the Bay Program, unravel the Clean Water Rule, and undermine the Bay's pollution diet, we must be more vigilant than ever  As Governor, I will protect the Bay from pollution and the effects of climate change by:    
1.	Investing in Natural Systems: I will fully fund programs for oyster restoration, reforestation, streambank revegetation, wetland restoration, and cover crops—all of which improve water quality and improve resilience to climate impacts.  
2.	Implementing Phosphorus Management Tool: I will work with farmers to implement the PMT to focus our efforts on the places where it will have the greatest impact.   
3.	Improving Agricultural Practices: We must do a better job leveraging the wide array of federal, state, and local programs designed to reduce nutrient pollution. From improved manure management and cover crops to precision nutrient application and advanced irrigation solutions, we can both reduce pollution and make farming more profitable.   
4.	Reducing pollution from Septic Tanks and Impervious Surfaces: We must prioritize water infrastructure projects that reduce pollution by connecting homes with septic systems to central sewer systems and encouraging green infrastructure solutions that reduce runoff pollution from impervious surfaces.  
5.	Addressing Upstream Threats: We must hold other Bay States accountable to fulfill their obligations to reduce nutrients, sediment, and toxics. We must resolve the growing crisis at the Conowingo Dam as more sediment overflows into the Bay during severe storm events.""","""Healthcare is a human right and under my administration, every Marylander will have access to affordable healthcare. Over 350,000 Marylanders are currently uninsured and, as the Trump administration continues attempts to dismantle our national healthcare infrastructure, another 400,000 Marylanders could lose coverage.

My administration will work with the General Assembly to develop and implement a state-run public option that would offer affordable healthcare coverage to every Maryland resident. A public option is a government-run insurance plan available over the Affordable Care Act exchanges that would compete against private insurers – driving down the overall cost of health insurance, particularly in areas with just one or two private insurance options.

This solution allows Maryland to achieve our goals of universal coverage and affordability without raising taxes or recklessly dismantling our current healthcare infrastructure. We need to make immediate improvements to the coverage, quality, and cost of Maryland's healthcare for all its residents—regardless of their income or zip code.

As Governor, I'll be focused on improving outcomes for patients, and to do so, I've called for the following: 

1.	Expanding Maryland's all-payer rate-setting system; 
2.	Reinvesting in preventative public health programs through innovation grants to local health departments; 
3.	Employing targeted enrollment incentives; 
4.	Improving healthcare access and coordination in rural areas by expanding grants to community health workers, school-based health centers, mobile integrated heath units, and other non-traditional providers and improving access to public transportation; 
5.	Enhancing senior care and end-of-life care; and 
6.	Developing new efforts to improve maternity care.""","Addressing the violence in Baltimore must be a top statewide priority. Annapolis must stop playing politics and start making strategic investments. As Governor, my administration will attack the fundamental causes of crime like poverty, crumbling schools, no jobs, poor transit, and public health needs.  We will not return to the failed strategies of mass incarceration, racial profiling, zero tolerance, mandatory minimums, blaming the judiciary, and the war on drugs.  As Governor, I will be a full partner in the City's efforts to rebuild trust between the community and police by providing significant resources and support to help the City achieve greater diversity within the ranks of the BPD; encourage more officers to live in the communities they serve; prioritize de-escalation; end the school-to-prison pipeline; and, above all, foster communication and trust among police and the communities they serve.

My administration will fund proven programs, like Safe Streets, Operation Safe Kids, de-escalation trainings, and gun buy-back programs. We will fully fund Baltimore public schools, build the Red Line, and provide free community college to expand economic opportunity.  We will also expand drug addiction like a public health crisis and ensure access to drug treatment and access to mental health services. We will also enact comprehensive gun violence prevention laws to slow the movement of guns into the City.  Most importantly, I will be a full partner with the Mayor who will bring the full suite of state executive branch resources to address the underlying causes that are fueling the violence.","""We have to be honest: Maryland is one of the toughest places to start and grow a business in the nation.  Our dependence upon 300,000 federal jobs has made us complacent and unwilling to make tough decisions that would improve our competitiveness. The truth is that without those federal jobs and contractors, Maryland would have the highest unemployment rate in the country.  Our complacency has led to job losses in manufacturing, information technology, and, most recently, media with the departure of Discovery.  In several other sectors, wages are down and many new jobs pay less than a living wage.

By focusing on the fundamentals, we can create 250,000 new jobs over the next four years:  

1.	Supporting Small Businesses: Small businesses create half of all jobs in Maryland. We must improve the predictability of permitting processes, eliminate redundant regulations, reconsider antiquated taxes fees, and expand access to capital.
2.	Catalyzing our Innovation Economy:  We have the nation's second most educated workforce, access to academic and government research to be commercialized, and thousands of entrepreneurs trying to contribute to the economy. We must support them with incubator space and access to capital, support services and markets.  
3.	Building an inclusive workforce: Many companies complain to me that they have a hard time finding employees with the skills they need.  

With free community college, strategic retraining initiatives, apprentice programs, and hiring incentives, we can connect Marylanders who want to work with employers in construction, specialized manufacturing, biotechnology, cybersecurity, and clean energy.""","Along with the corrosive role of money in politics, gerrymandering is one of the single greatest threats to the health of our democracy.  Voters should pick their elected officials—elected officials should not pick their voters.  I support calls for independent experts to draw district lines in Maryland using transparent processes/formulas to ensure fairness. At the same time, I will work regionally on solutions to ensure that our good government actions in Maryland do not adversely affect the overall balance of power in the U.S. House.","I believe the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights (LEOBR) should be reformed.  We must expand community involvement in policing and promote greater transparency, while still ensuring officers can continue to effectively perform their duties and their rights as public servants remain protected.

It's vital that we restore trust between police and the communities they serve. 

The only way to achieve this is to overhaul our approach to community policing, which must include opening the LEOBR to a review process driven by community input. Right now, the LEOBR prevents legitimate civilian oversight of police. Disciplinary action against officers cannot be imposed unless recommended, ""by a hearing board comprised of other sworn officers."" While the vast majority of police officers have good intentions, this system cannot help but create systemic bias and erode trust with the community.

Communities deserve to have a say in the way public safety is provided. They should have significant input into the structure and standards of acceptable behavior within their local police force. Individuals involved in policy misconduct investigations should have access to the results, without compromising the sensitive personal data. As the state works with local law enforcement to promote de-escalation training, cultural competency training to build a culture where black lives matter, and other forms of community policing initiatives, the need for LEOBR's protections will likely dramatically decrease. We have the power to ensure communities and police are rebuilding trust and working together to promote public safety and a healthy society together.","My strategy to address the opioid crisis includes:

1.	Taking immediate action to save lives: My administration is committed to spending the state resources needed to address the shortage of Naloxone; every law enforcement official, public health provider, and Maryland household should have access to this life-saving drug. We also need to expand the Overdose Survivor Outreach Program to every medical facility in the state to funnel those struggling with addition into medically-based treatment programs.

2.	Expanding access to addiction treatment: We must treat addiction like a disease and ensure 24/7 access to behavioral health services. We need to integrate the Maryland Department of Health with other state-run services to coordinate whole-person care for those struggling with any kind of addiction, while improving the availability of buprenorphine and methadone. Realigning our state agencies' data, eligibility, and approach to service could both expand access and significantly reduce the cost of this and future interventions to taxpayers.

3.	Investing in long-term prevention strategies: We must address what economists Anne Case and Angus Deaton describe as ""deaths of despair."" Deaths from drug overdose, suicide, and alcohol remain highest in economically depressed urban and rural communities and among people without a college degree. To attack this fundamental inequity, we need to make education and economic opportunity available from cradle to career—restoring both access and dignity to work and investing in our state's educational infrastructure. This includes fully funding public schools, providing free community college and retraining programs, and investing in public transit.","There is no silver bullet. We must invest from cradle to career:

1. Maternity care and infant health: Fighting inequality must start at birth. We must address Maryland's staggeringly bad outcomes related to maternal health and infant mortality.

2. Universal pre-kindergarten: Nearly 40% of 3- and 4-year old children still do not have access to pre-k and they rarely catch up to their peers.

3. Fully funding our schools

4. Free community college/training programs: We must work to train individuals to compete for jobs in clean energy, biosecurity, information technology, and construction trades. 

5. Access to transit: Retraining is useless unless individuals can physically get to their jobs. The Red Line will serve as a gateway for residents to access 250,000 jobs. 

6. Wages: We need to increase the minimum wage.

7. Right to organize: When labor has the power to collectively bargain, work conditions improve, basic rights are protected, and wages of both unionized and non-unionized employees rise.

8. Decriminalization: Employment opportunities often plummet after going through the system. Efforts to ban the box and invest in re-entry programs are not nearly as effective as reducing arrests for non-violent infractions.

9. Access to capital: Women and minority entrepreneurs have harder times accessing capital.The state should increase direct financial and technical support to start businesses.

10. Tax fairness: Given the regressive nature of recently adopted Republican tax plan, we must ensure that Maryland's tax code is progressive, closes loopholes, and expands programs like the earned income tax credit.
","Transparency is a key tenant of democracy.  Despite the Maryland Open Meetings Act requiring nearly all state government bodies to keep all meetings open to the public, provide adequate advanced public notification for future meetings, and require note-taking and the opportunity for the public to raise questions or concerns during proceedings, we have recently seen examples where the exceptions within the law are being abused.

Many of the worst abuses have occurred when public bodies are performing administrative functions. This includes the administration of a public law or ""rule, regulation, or bylaw of the body,"" which has diminished the ability of the public to influence or fully understand certain governance regulations designed to hold institutions accountable.

As Governor, I will work with the General Assembly to update the Open Meetings Act to make sure the public has access to records and meetings on administrative topics including discussion on the regulations of public bodies. This reform keeps institutions more accountable to citizens, and allows the public to take an active role in the development of administrative regulations.

In addition, the 1970 Public Information Act currently prevents citizens from requesting financial or commercial information that supposedly serves the state's interest to keep confidential. While I agree that personal data must be protected, information about land-use permits by industries and corporations is critical to efforts to protect the environment and achieve workable solutions. This exception must be changed, particularly if we want to hold industries accountable for their impact on natural resources.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?
