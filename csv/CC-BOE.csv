I believe CCPS has to much over head in Central Office and it needs to be re-evaluated. I would like to see salary caps for Administrative positions in Central Office. Teachers spend a great deal of ""off hours time"" doing work and are not compensated for that time. We need to look into the needs of the support staff who have no benefits. We need to stop doing more with less. This is no benefit to the students because they are the ones who are doing without in the classroom. Class size is a key to helping Teachers teach our children to be successful in life. When ever there are cuts, students needs are always the first to go and that only makes the actual Teachers job more difficult. The priorities need to be students, teachers then administrators for proper funding.","We definitely need more Crisis counselors in our schools and Resource staff. The Middle School age is where this is needed the most. School Resource Officers I feel are mostly needed in the High Schools, but Law Enforcement does do property checks and walk throughs of all our schools. Most Principals have a wonderful relationship with Law Enforement that patrol the areas. I do feel our schools are a safe environment for students and staff, but we should always make sure we keep our eyes and ears open for any behavior changes that may be seen in a student. See something say something is so important.","We really need to stop the push for students to be ""College Ready"". Students need to be ""Real World Ready"". Not every student is going to college. Not every student knows what they want to do once they graduate high school. We need to start looking at students interests and build a education plan based on that. Yes, students receive a Maryland High School diploma, but we should also offer a Certificate of Interest. Students will mostly pick electives that their interests are driven in such as Fine Arts, Science, English, Trades or Agricultural. Engaging students to learn what their strengths are would keep a student involved in their studies and they would more than likely go out into the world doing what their interested in. Every student is different. Every student learns different and the basics are important, but we really need to guide students in what their strengths and interests are for a student to be successful in life.","We should be expanding class base career and technical education into the main schools and not just in a central base facility. We should also be expanding career and technical education in the evening to adults that want to change careers and not isolate that in the colleges. If a student in High School wants to look into going to career and tech, they should be doing at least a five hour internship/shadowing in a local business to be sure that is what they want to do. Then, that local business can evaluate if the student would be a good candidate for that particular program the student is interested in. This would help make sure the student will complete the career and tech program and be successful.","Our Teachers are not able to teach freely. Our Teachers are teaching the students to be good test takers. We need to do away with PARCC. Some standardized tests are beneficial to make sure the student is learning the material, but a Teacher should not be evaluated based on the scores and a school should not looked at as good or bad based on test scores.",How can we improve the diversity work force when we need to improve the diversity in our schools first. No one should be hired based on what they look like. We should be looking at qualifications and thats it! Our schools should be more welcoming to celebrating diversity and that would be a good start. Some schools don't decorate for holidays or celebrate them. We should be more open to teaching the culture of different holidays which would open the doors to students being understanding of others in the world. Thats how you improve diversity. This would also help in diminishing bullying and discrimination in our communities.

In order to provide rigorous instruction to meet the needs of all of our students we must recruit and retain quality staff members. Teachers make important decisions about planning and instructional delivery. Teachers are crucial to meeting the needs of learners. All staff members who are responsible for developing our students should receive competitive compensation. Carroll County Public School salaries should be competitive with those offered in surrounding counties.","CCPS has established procedures to ensure the safety of students and staff. Schools have specific safety plans in effect. Entry into all buildings is secure with cameras and intercom systems in place. Drivers' licenses are used for identification. There is a Supervisor of School Security who trains staff members and monitors procedures that are to be in effect. It would be appropriate to expand the Office of School Security to include trained persons to work with the Supervisor of School Security. Trained School Resource Officers are important to ensuring the safety of students and staff. A recent Senate Bill (1265, Maryland Safe to Learn Act) to take effect on June 1, 2018, will provide either a School Resource Officer or adequate law enforcement protection to every public school in the state. This will enhance the safety of all students and staff in CCPS. The bill provides that the School Resource Officers must complete specialized training. By September 1, 2018, each local school system must establish one or more assessment teams to identify and provide intervention for students or staff who may be a threat to school safety. Crisis counselors are instrumental in providing stability and coping strategies to students or staff members who are experiencing a crisis.",The CCPS curriculum is rigorous enough when it is implemented effectively. Careful planning and instructional delivery are needed to ensure students' success. County benchmark assessments are used to monitor students' progress.,"Career and technical education offerings are available at the Carroll County Career and Technology Center in Westminster, MD. The Center provides opportunities to all high school students in Carroll County to pursue career and technology programs based on their interests and the possibility of being successful in their chosen program. The learning opportunities prepare students to enter employment and continue their education. Students are educated in an environment similar to the environment in which they will work. CCPS can explore additional partnerships with businesses.","The Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (PARCC) and standardized testing should be used as intended to measure students' performance in various subject areas. Our curriculum and instruction are based on standards that specify what students know or understand and should be able to do in various subject areas. The state assessment, PARCC, measures students' progress on achieving the standards. The aim is to make sure students are on track to succeed in academic areas. Teachers and parents can determine if younger students are acquiring the necessary skills and knowledge to progress to the next level, and older students can see if they are on track to graduate, ready for careers and college. The results of the standardized testing can be used to make comparisons among other schools. The results can also be used to formalize goals for School Improvement Plans, thus ensuring students' needs are targeted and achievement gaps between high- and low-performing students are lessened or closed.","Improving the diversity of the CCPS workforce is very important. Our county should be appealing to all applicants. I would suggest forming partnerships with historically Black colleges and universities to involve students in practical experiences in our school system, for example, observing classes, completing required hours for specific courses, providing professional development partnerships, or completing student teaching. I also suggest recruiting our current students who are interested in becoming part of our workforce and interviewing them for possible openings once they are ready to work. Providing support groups or partnerships for minorities would be important. CCPS must continue its efforts to provide diversity training for all members of the workforce, including Board Members, to enhance a nonthreatening environment for everyone. Appropriate goals for minority hiring include: (1) hiring members of ethnic groups that equal the percentage of minorities reflected in the student demographics (2) having the minority recruiting and retention rate reflect the rate of non-minority retention","Given the financial situation facing CCPS and assuming no significant changes to state funding formulas or commissioner funding support, where does improving teacher salaries rank as a priority for you and why?

I have taken graduate classes and several professional development courses and workshops in nonprofit management and marketing. My own childhood education growing up in a Navy family was comprised of attending eight different schools across the country and overseas.,"My career has consisted of four different vocations: two paid and two volunteer. Right out of college, I was a wildlife educator at a small zoo, presenting hundreds of live animal programs for schools, daycare centers, retirement communities, and other groups. This included development and promotion of the programs in addition to a wide range of other responsibilities. I was ultimately promoted to General Manager. Later I spent several years in nonprofit marketing and membership management for scientific professional societies, including the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. In recent years, I have been a community advocate, seeking to strengthen our local schools. This has included supporting a local grassroots group Carroll Values Education and volunteering for pro-education political candidates. I also helped establish another local grassroots group called VOCAL Carroll County which encourages citizen participation in local government. Finally, I have been the primary at-home caregiver for my two children who are young adults now, spending many years opting out of the full-time workforce during their pre-K and teen years.",http://www.dueppenforeducation.com,dueppen4education,Dueppen4Carroll,http://surveygizmoresponseuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/fileuploads/296249/4299919/95-3ab37b8ff6190820cd536a500588dbf5_27497202_10204073317308633_1540211133_n.jpg,"No significant funding changes in either the state formula or commissioner support could be disastrous for Carroll County Public Schools. The lack of competitive compensation makes it very difficult to recruit and retain high-quality employees. With or without significant funding changes, improving teacher salaries is one of my top financial priorities because it is crucial for providing innovative and effective instruction for students. If funding doesn't change, then in order to avoid unacceptable increases of class sizes and other serious impacts to equitable learning opportunities, some extra-curricular activities and other aspects of non-classroom operations would have to be restructured.","CCPS personnel led by the Supervisor of School Security and Emergency Management are supported by a Board-appointed Security Advisory Council (SAC). It is ""…comprised of school directors, principals, representatives from all employee groups, and parents, as well as members from the law enforcement and emergency management community."" Missing in that equation, at least at the high school level, is the student voice. They are young adults who will quickly become much more responsible for their own well-being. We teach our children to take ownership of their personal safety from an early age and it is right for them to have empowered voices in their schools. The CCPS Security Advisory Council should make it a priority to develop a revised plan for preventing, mitigating, and responding to active shooter and similar incidents plus establish enhanced communication with parents about these protocols. While one aspect of security involves keeping some information guarded to avoid providing a roadmap to potential attackers, fear and worry is stoked by a lack of knowledge. Another delicate balancing act is how much to harden schools versus fostering a welcoming atmosphere and nurturing learning environment. School Resource Officers, if appropriately trained and utilized, can be beneficial. And with the Maryland Safe To Learn Act, I believe SROs will be a reality for CCPS. However, figuring out the funding is difficult, especially when there are so many demands for those dollars. This includes crisis counselors, which I believe might provide even more value to the students.","I do not believe that there is enough rigor in the CCPS curriculum. But the typical things many people think of – more work; harder work – are not what really add rigor in my view. In fact, such tactics are often counter-productive. I think that rigor is best introduced when lessons are creative, experiential, and cross disciplines, like the payoff of solving a difficult puzzle. Instruction can be rigorous if students are supported and encouraged to take risks and ask lots of exploratory questions themselves. Teachers need to be empowered and rewarded for lesson-planning this way. Students should be taught to recognize their own strengths and weaknesses, build resilience, set goals, and stretch. The key is not just high-level tasks and expectations but teaching high-level thinking and making it fun. Students who learn to support and celebrate each other's efforts will also elevate rigor naturally. Hiring, training, retaining, and empowering teachers who can do this successfully is the key. These teachers are the ones who should be primarily responsible for the necessary curriculum design.","The Carroll County Career and Technology Center (CTC) is a very high-performing part of CCPS. It is long overdue for modernization and expansion but since a new state-of-art center was not funded, I support the current plan to phase in those improvements. There is also an educational specifications committee that will soon be issuing a report on future direction and priorities that will inform Board decisions. Some CTC programs are in very high demand with dozens of interested and motivated students left out. I would like to see specific focus on how to increase access. This could include offering grant or fee-based summer programs, expanding classroom-based programs in other high schools, or even distance learning options if the subject matter supports it (computer science, for example). As with many improvements, there is a fiscal impact on most options for improving career and technical offerings but funding issues impede growth. However, with parts of the recommendations from the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education (aka Kirwan Commission) being implemented, I am hopeful that the funding picture for Career and Technical Education from the state will improve.","The pitfalls of high stakes testing and teaching to the test are widely acknowledged. I do not support elimination of all standardized assessments, however, because I also think some usefulness is clear. Achieving the right balance using the most valid tests is important. CCPS has managed to reduce the amount of testing locally but the jury is still out on PARCC. It is mandated by the state of Maryland but has been problematic and is not required by the federal law ESSA (Every Students Succeeds Act). It is my hope that Maryland will make it a priority to ensure that using PARCC is justified and not simply a continuation of the culture of over-testing. This is another area of education policy that I think should be driven to a greater degree at all levels by current classroom teachers.","I accept the notion that all students benefit from diversity and believe it is very important to improve the diversity of the CCPS workforce. This includes ethnicity, age, and gender. In terms of ethnicity, I agree that a proportion of minority employees that mirrors the student population is appropriate. However, continuous improvement towards that goal is advisable. According to CCPS's 2017 Diversity Recruitment and Retention Report, the percentage of minority students is 16% - with staff at 4% and the resident population at 8%. Despite several initiatives, there has been minimal improvement. I need to see a deeper analysis of other statistics to ascertain which efforts are working are which aren't (and to provide more granular metrics for goal-setting). Are the most effective activities simply palliative? One newer initiative for CCPS that may hold promise in the long-term is the effort to cultivate local students into local teachers in the future. A major roadblock is that having a diverse workforce is not a goal unique to Carroll County. Other counties target this highly sought-after, yet limited, candidate pool. Lack of competitive compensation exacerbates the problem. Another roadblock to CCPS teacher recruitment surely factors in as well - the fact that the budget cycle prevents the administration from offering contracts as early in the year as other counties. Beginning to address these concerns and improving the value proposition of working for CCPS may be necessary to make more significant gains in diversity hiring.","Given the financial situation facing CCPS and assuming no significant changes to state funding formulas or commissioner funding support, where does improving teacher salaries rank as a priority for you and why?

Additionally, I have owned a small business, worked in broadcasting (XM Satellite Radio), and am a freelance journalist (Village Voice Media, etc)",http://www.HeltonforCarroll.com,JasonHeltonforCarrollBoardofEducation,,http://surveygizmoresponseuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/fileuploads/296249/4299919/253-157e704490a761d9c2e48027b37a11db_headshot.jpg,"Recruiting and retaining quality teachers is a top priority of mine, and in order to do that, they must be compensated generously in the best of circumstances, or at the very least, fairly. I am deeply disturbed in talking with my own children's teachers, that they must sometimes take a second or even third job to be able to make ends meet. A teacher is already expected to teach during the day, work from home on grading, lesson planning, and various other tasks, and be a part of their own families. It's not fair that they are compensated so poorly that they need to consider additional employment, just to own a home or pay off their own school debt. The teachers of Carroll County went far too long without pay increases, and we need to ensure the CCPS honors the agreement recently made that corrects that disservice. At the very least, teachers deserve annual cost of living increases. I feel that CCPS need to look at its budget extremely carefully, look for alternative cost-saving measures that don't require closing more schools and practice good, fiscal responsibility that allows for teachers to get the increases they deserve. CCPS should also look at other incentives such as Student Loan Repayment to assist in recruiting and retaining quality educators.","I applaud the Sheriff's Department and the County Commissioners for their renewed focus of school physical security, but I feel that CCPS itself can play a larger role in securing schools. One technique we use often in Information Technology is random security audits. We probe our own systems to look for vulnerabilities that could compromise operations. Our schools should do the same. We need a dedicated physical security officer whose job it is to conduct random audits of school physical security. This officer should attempt to physically find flaws in each school that could lead to potential disasters, and provide schools with reports detailing these vulnerabilities so that they can be addressed. Something as simple as an unlocked door, an open window, or a secretary failing to follow identification protocols could lead to a tragic situation. We need students to feel comfortable talking to peers, teachers, and faculty about their concerns for their safety, and those concerns need to be taken seriously. Something as simple as reporting a threatening Facebook post could stave off an attack. As a child, I was bullied tremendously and was the victim of school violence. I could have gone down the path of so many, resorting to violence, either towards myself or others. My school, seeing my situation, found me a resource in the form of a teacher mentor who worked with me throughout my Junior and Senior years, and potentially saved my life. CCPS should explore these low-cost but potentially beneficial resources for students.","I feel that with so much emphasis on standardized testing, teachers have been forced to teach towards the test. I think what is missing is the practical application of those English and Math skills, and by not using them in the day to day, those skills are lost. I think the material that is being taught is fairly solid (at least judging my own children's development), but by judging teachers on standardized testing, the practical application can sometimes get left out. I would prefer that teachers get more autonomy for creating lesson plans, and that those lesson plans address the core material, but also include such valuable skills as critical thinking, creativity, and practical application.","As a product of a technical education, I feel society and CCPS don't do enough for those seeking vocational and technical education. Our current facility nowhere near meets the needs of our student population, and while it may not be financially sound to build a brand new technical education center, creative means could be found to improve the situation for students. There is a noticeable decline in skilled tradespersons (i.e.. Plumbers, Electricians, etc.), and an epidemic of insurmountable college debt. By providing better resources to students who cannot afford, or simply aren't interested in attending college, we can build the next generation of skilled workers. I have already reached out and hope to work with local and national businesses, in hopes of developing relationships with CCPS in terms of funding and supporting technical education. It's in the best interest of these companies, as they could literally be helping to build replacements for the aging and dwindling skilled labor workforce. I myself benefitted from an apprenticeship, that turned into a job; we should consider looking into this as a possible educational tool again. Imagine graduating high school, trained for a highly skilled career, with a job lined up for you to start immediately. I think that with the right amount of cooperation between CCPS and businesses, we can really make a difference in these student's lives.","With so few states continuing to use the PARCC test, it's difficult to say how effective it's been in charting student success. We need a good way to accurately measure the success of students, and in theory, a standardized test should be a good way to measure. I feel however, that too much weight is placed on standardized testing. When teachers are being evaluated on their student's test scores, some teachers are forced to turn education into test prep, and I feel that preparing for a test and preparing for higher education/adult life are two very different things. I feel the effectiveness of standardized testing declines as students get older. It's a great way of measuring basic skills learned in early years, but doesn't evaluate the practicality of the learning. A child may understand the concept they've been taught, but that concept is devalued if it can't be applied to a real-world scenario. These tests also don't evaluate critical thinking and problem-solving skills, which are essential for successful adults.","I think maintaining a diverse workforce is in the best interest of our students. First and foremost, we need to aggressively pursue high quality teachers from all walks of life, by offering them competitive compensation at hire, and retain them by keeping that compensation competitive. We need recruiters to actively search for highly qualified new teachers, and add incentives like Student Loan Repayment for those who commit to CCPS for a period of years and perform admirably. We focus so much on racial diversity, but to create a true culture of diversity in our schools, we should consider other factors like socioeconomic class and religious practices. We should celebrate all differences, not just the physical.","Given the financial situation facing CCPS and assuming no significant changes to state funding formulas or commissioner funding support, where does improving teacher salaries rank as a priority for you and why?

This must come as a result of more efficiency in the school system in all areas that are outside the classroom. County funding must continue to progress as well, by virtue of continued progress in economic development. And state funding for education must improve whether it be by formula or by a greater effort of the Carroll delegation to seek and obtain additional funding. Carroll County also can be a more desirable place to teach by greatly reducing the administrative burden on teachers and providing more support to work being done in the classroom.","School security must always be a priority, not just in times of recent tragedy. We must continue and enhance to secure school buildings and provide School Resource Officers. Well trained law enforcement professionals must become part of the school community in order to enhance student safety and yet maintain a learning and comfortable environment. There is also a role for crisis counselors and other means of support as well. Each school needs to maintain the ability to respond to community support and mental health needs to lessen the likelihood of tragic occurrence. And yet, our primary focus at this point must be on securing the school facilities and providing safer schools.","I believe that much too much of the curriculum is designed to meet the demand for excessive standardized testing. All of our curriculum would do well to be designed around the needs of Carroll County students, not what happens to be on some test. This will help all aspects of student performance. The issue of remedial math and English is overstated. There are comparable results from those that home school or go to private school. And many community college students do not star right from high school and that also creates the need for remedial classes. So again, this measure should be used as a guide, but not as a reason to criticize or question school performance. And yet, we should continually look for opportunities to increase the rigor of our math and science classes.","The school system should use the revitalization of the Carroll Career & Technology Center as an great opportunity to enhance career and technical offerings. Curriculum needs to have less emphasis on standardized tests and more freedom for teachers to create their own content. This will all support greater offerings, better content and enhanced student performance. At every grade level, class and course offerings should be reviewed to provide a wider range of offerings. Entrepreneurship should also be embraced in career and technology education offerings and should be met with continuation of those classes at Carroll Community College.",All standardized testing needs to be reviewed and reconsidered. Such testing should be limited and it should be used only as a guide. It should not be something that is required or something that local jurisdictions use as a reason to constantly change curriculum. PARCC itself has proven to be flawed and needs to be replaced as well.,"Diversity in the workplace is something the should always be supported and encouraged. It should be the hallmark of any organization and any community that is open, welcoming, accepting and one without racial or ethnic barriers. At the same time, I do not believe that arbitrary hiring goals aimed at diversity measures are effective or appropriate either. Diversity should be the natural by product of good hiring practices over a period of time that allows full opportunity for all applicants and a welcoming environment for those hired.","Given the financial situation facing CCPS and assuming no significant changes to state funding formulas or commissioner funding support, where does improving teacher salaries rank as a priority for you and why?

We need to look at bumping up the starting salary and staying consistent with increases. A year ago we took a good step forward with teacher salaries. We need to continue to monitor that honor the steps. We need to responsibility manage the budget to meet these priorities while maintaining our current tax rates.","Securing our facilities is an important issue. I do not feel that teachers should be armed. But, the school properties should not be ""gun free zones."" Our local police should have a presence at our schools, supplemented by well trained, and armed, School Resource Officers. In past years, we had Crisis Counselors assigned to schools. To stay proactive, we need Behavior Specialists, at each school, who can work with both students and families.","Since my children attended Carroll County schools in the 90's, I have heard of many students having to take remedial math and English classes at college. In some ways, the curriculum may not be rigorous enough. But, we also need to guide students, who are planning to attend college, to take the correct courses to prepare. Unfortunately, some students do not pick that path until too late in high school. We also need to encourage more parental involvement. With family support and the correct guidance in school, I also know many CCPS graduates who tested out of freshman math and English at many colleges.",I think we have good career and tech offerings. We do need to constantly evaluate them and stay current with technology. We need to make sure that the maximum number of students can take advantage of the options available. We do not need a new building. Many of the current classes could be in different buildings that are currently not being efficiently used. We need to use available classroom space at Westminster and also around the county at other high school facilities. This would free up space in the current Tech Center to expand capacity for the programs that are not functional in a traditional classroom space. We also need to look at how students can apply and be accepted into these programs. Traditional academic standards for acceptance do not always apply to the opportunities at the Career and Tech Center.,"PARCC and standardized testing are necessary evils. They do provide accurate measurements of student performance, to some extent. They are accountable, structured and objective. But, do they measure student progress and proficiency over time? Has testing grown to the point that it causes more stress and uses more classroom time than is justified? We need to understand that data from test results are great tools, but not the only tools. They do not measure social skills, work ethic or resourcefulness which are traits also needed to be successful. We need to constantly evaluate the classroom time and monies spend on testing versus the results gained. Much of the testing is worthwhile and useful. But, we cannot let it get out of hand.","Improving the diversity of the CCPS workforce is very important. Adding qualified teachers of color to any school system is a plus. It is interesting that while the percentage of minorities in the CCPS workforce is only about one half the percentage in the county population, the percentage of minority students is much higher. The CCPS has improved the percentage of minority hires in three of the last five years. But, more needs to be done. Having worked in construction for many years and dealt with preset goals, I feel they are not effective. There are too many outside factors. But, CCPS does need to consistently grow the diversity of their workforce. Hiring managers need to expand their recruitment efforts to more schools that have a larger minority enrollment. We need to find more incentives for minority teachers to come here, possibly through extra-curricular opportunities or community programs.","Given the financial situation facing CCPS and assuming no significant changes to state funding formulas or commissioner funding support, where does improving teacher salaries rank as a priority for you and why? If you believe it needs improvement, how do you propose doing so?","In light of current school shootings and security discussions, what do you believe are necessary steps CCPS should take to ensure the safety of its students? What are your thoughts on School Resource Officers? Crisis counselors?","In previous years, there have been discussions about CCPS graduates having to take remedial math and English classes at Carroll Community College. Do you believe CCPS curriculum is rigorous enough and what specific improvements would you like to see made at the local level?",What further steps if any should the district take to improve career and technical education offerings?,What are your thoughts on PARCC and standardized testing in general?,How important is improving the diversity of the CCPS workforce and how would you proposing doing so?

Educators in this county did not receive raises for seven years prior to my election to the board and we still have not been able to make up the lost steps in the last four years. We must continue to examine our budget for cost savings as well as advocate for increased funding from local, state and federal governments.","Our funding priority should be crisis counselors in the high schools, counselors in middle schools and behavioral specialists in all elementary schools. By doing this, we can identify and address individual student needs in a pro-active approach. School resource officers are there to build a positive relationship with students and the community and provide an extra level of security should a situation arise.","CCPS curriculum and student outcomes are continually reviewed to ensure our curriculum prepares students for the rigors of college-level courses. Changes to require math be taken all four years of high school will help. We have seen improvements over the past years and will continue to monitor student success. Recent changes in math instruction have shown positive results, but the students have not yet reached high school age.","The Carroll County Career and Tech programs are phenomenal. Other counties have used our programs as a model. We have a facility that is forty years old. Unless we modernize or replace our Career and Technology Center, we will fall behind those counties that have made that investment for their students' futures.","Standardized testing, including PARCC, is designed to test the system, not the student. Results take too long to come back to be useful in instruction. The tests are being given in a different way than the students are taught. Too much instructional time is lost due to testing and preparing for testing. Future tests must be modified to reflect instruction, not instruction modified to pass the tests.","It's hugely important. Last month, CCPS modified regulations to ban hate symbols. This action sends a message to everyone that Carroll County want to be a welcoming and inclusive school system. We continue to prioritize compensation to attract good candidates and then keep them here. At a minimum, our workforce should match our student enrollment. All students benefit from a culturally diverse environment. We must prepare our students for a world beyond Carroll County.","Given the financial situation facing CCPS and assuming no significant changes to state funding formulas or commissioner funding support, where does improving teacher salaries rank as a priority for you and why?
