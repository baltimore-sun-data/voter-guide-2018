The County should not focus on high density housing or mass transportation, but rather should focus on quality residential and limited commercial development in order to protect the rural, agricultural and historical character of Carroll County. I know how to protect property rights and restrict government overreach which may be happening in the Comprehensive Rezoning Plan currently underway in Carroll County.

Nobody moved to Carroll County because they wanted government bureaucrats to build a bunch of apartments and low-end housing next to their existing communities.  If citizens wanted the trappings of urbanization, they would have simply stayed in places like Owings Mills or Gaithersburg. They do not want it, and, as your Commissioner, I will defend our citizens’ rights to live in communities of THEIR choice, NOT the government’s.

Regarding State mandated planning requirements, I believe in and follow the rule of law, but I also believe in changing/repealing laws which violate our Federal and State Constitutions.
","My vision for economic development in Carroll County is to lower taxes, decrease regulation and eliminate bureaucratic red tape which will support existing small business and make the market more attractive for new business.

Economic development depends on the image of the County and media plays a large role in shaping that image. Therefore, because the media is so influential, it is critical that the media remain impartial in order to promote fair and balanced elections. Historically, the liberal media has attempted to unfairly affect the outcome of elections in traditionally conservative areas by endorsing ""liberal"" candidates to promote their success and the defeat of ""conservative"" candidates. This practice is blatantly unethical as is having moderators from said media moderate candidate forums. Liberal candidates endorsed by liberal media ensure that taxes will not be lowered or regulations reduced, thus negatively affecting the economic development in keeping with the rural, agricultural character of Carroll County.
","Historically, the School budget is around 50% of the total budget, so the 2019 budget is on par with recent budgets. There should not be a set percentage of the County budget dedicated to public education each year. Rather, I will vote to fund any fully justified responsible budget submitted by the school board. 

Our schools must be safe and properly funded. The latest school shootings in Florida and Maryland were acts of domestic violence. Studies are showing that more than half of all mass shootings are domestic violence related. I will continue to advocate for greater awareness about the abuse of power in our homes, churches, schools and government.  
","No, the current liberal spending policies of four out of five commissioners, including my opponent, has virtually spent all of the County's revenue. There is approximately one million dollars left and spending requests for 15-20 million.

Again, as a Republican Candidate in a Republican primary in accordance with the Republican platform of smaller government and lower taxes, I believe a supermajority is too low a standard and that only a unanimous vote of all five members will suffice to raise taxes. This will guard against the current infestation of RINO's (Republicans In Name Only) and liberals trying to turn Carroll County into some other county. ","I 100% OPPOSE a move from commissioner to charter government. At the local level, charter government centralizes power, costs more  because it creates yet another level of government bureaucracy and raises taxes. Citizens do not want Charter government. This form of government has been voted down six times in the past. It's not the form of government, but the implementation at the local level which often leads to corruption The Commissioner form of Government for Carroll County works best. I have seen first hand what Charter government has done to Taneytown and secondarily to Frederick County. Drugs and high water bills run rampant in Taneytown. I have also testified against the attempted government land grab going on in Frederick County
","Just because the State ""enables"" something doesn't mean the County should follow suit like a herd of lemmings over a cliff. It's the same old ""liberal giberal"" we have a problem, let's grow the government; the problem gets bigger, let's grow the government some more, no Not in a Republican county during a Republican Primary. Let's stop the madness and get back to Faith-based caring communities which will solve social problems better than an ever growing government bureaucracy draining the taxpayers.

Regarding Volunteer Emergency Service Personnel, I support real incentives like tax breaks and tuition discounts for volunteers. Also, we need to increase our recruiting efforts in the high schools. Volunteer fire departments provide an intangible community benefit which helps fight drugs and other social problems that should not be lost through government controlled services.
","Prevention is the key, followed by treatment and enforcement as the three prongs to the drug crisis. You do not solve a drug problem by introducing more drugs into the County. I will continue to lead and to lobby against recreational pot at the local, county and state level to help prevent another generation of opioid addicts. I will further address the epidemic of opioid and other drug abuse by respecting the proper role of God in our families and government.  I will support faith-based initiatives to address the spiritual/emotional needs at the core of alcohol and drug abuse. I will utilize Public Service Announcements to encourage all citizens take free training in the administration of noxalone through Operation Save-A-Life (call 410-876-4800) and to get involved in community wide education efforts. Vote Adelaide for Commissioner on June 26th, because if you don't vote in the Primary, then your vote won't count.

We need to adjust zoning districts to allow residential growth. Higher density development should be around public water and sewer. Current zoning basically allows 1 ,2, 4, or 5 houses per acre, depending on the zone. We should also allow houses to be clustered when land dictates it's use. If the land has some feature that does not allow even development, then there should be a provision that allows houses to be clustered on a portion of the land if the total number of houses dose not exceed the zoning.",". Carroll County has had unprecedented economic development over the last three years. We have done so well that we now need more ""shovel ready"" lots for development. The county has put money into the infrastructure in the land and businesses have come. We have a well-educated work force which also attracts business. We just need to keep doing what we've been doing to keep economic development moving forward.","I do not believe there should be a set percentage put aside for the school system. The county puts almost half of its budget into the schools.  We must remember that Carroll County Government is only one funding source for the schools.  The percentage, not just the actual dollars, that the state has contributed to the schools has dropped. When there is a gap between what the schools ask for and the total amount that they are budgeted for, everyone looks to the county to make up the difference. I believe the County has done everything it could do for the schools in the past three years.","Existing revenue sources have worked because of some creative adjustments of fund allocations.  We need to hold the line on revenue, as long as we can deliver services that are expected and needed and pay our bills. I am not in favor of the super majority to pass a tax increase. The same majority that is needed to pass everything else in the county should be sufficient to raise taxes. If people want a super majority for something let's use it to pass the budget, that is the most important thing we do.",". I am in favor of having a charter written and having the people of Carroll County voting on an actual charter. Carroll county needs to explore charter government. While the current Board of Commissioners work well together, we still must run to Annapolis to get many things accomplished. A commissioner form of government is not and cannot be as responsive as charter government.",". We need to help the local volunteer fire companies to recruit and retain volunteers. We put money aside for that purpose in last years budget. However, no matter what we do I believe we are going to transition into a paid force, hopefully far in the future. How we accomplish that transition, needs to be worked out between the county and all fire companies working together. Other counties have made this transition and we are looking at how it was accomplished and what were the best practices used.",.To combat the opioid epidemic we need seamless transitions from detox to rehab to outpatient services. I introduced legislation that would allow a 12 hour hold on people that have overdosed so they can be evaluated and given counseling. Rehab facilities need to be expanded so people seeking rehab can get into a facility that day. When discharged a support system needs to be ready the next day. I also introduced legislation so that when discharged from rehab people will have a program in place that starts the next day.

I dealt with a wide variety of constituent issues so I have a unique understanding of the types of concerns and problems county residents have.

Residents in Carroll County District 5 are worried their communities will be negatively impacted by adverse changes in local zoning.  The county is trying to incentivize growth in this district through zoning and that is bringing unwanted road and school congestion and a loss of the rural community we have enjoyed.  Because county government is manipulating zoning to incentivize growth existing residents are concerned whether their properties will retain value.  Frequent or unpredictable changes in zoning also make development an uncertain prospect and that is a disincentive to invest money in property.  County government should ""incentivize growth"" by making Carroll the place people and businesses want to come and be part of due to lower costs, fewer mandates, less regulation, safer environment, nice communities, stability, etc.     State-mandated planning requirements create many of the problems counties have to deal with.  Carroll County already complies with state-mandated planning requirements, despite the problems they create.","My focus will be on economic growth achieved by low taxes and fewer regulations -- proven vehicles for economic growth.  Government shouldn't be an impediment to business but create an environment in which business can be more profitable and grow more easily. Impediments to growth are burdensome regulations; adverse zoning changes endangering the intended use of property; and lengthy, unpredictable, hard to negotiate, repetitive permitting processes.  The county should constantly monitor for these hindrances and remove them.  Reducing the costs of doing business in Carroll will be incentive for business to locate in Carroll, stay in Carroll and continue to grow.  Also, Carroll County is a bedroom community with an aging population.  Successful development will recognize and support existing demographics rather than try to force changes in the demographics.   Economic development tools that governments employ, like job training and entrepreneur development, can be business opportunities in themselves.  Companies can and will operate these types of businesses if they do not have to compete with government agencies.  The county must be diligent not to use taxpayer dollars to compete with private business in development and training.","The State sets each county's yearly funding obligation called Maintenance of Effort (MoE).   The State of Maryland funds its portion of each school budget based on the number of students in each county school system, with the amount rising as the student population increases and falls with falling population.  The county does not adjust its funding similarly.  In fact, as the State's funding falls, the school asks the county to fund above MoE and pick up the difference in funding from the State.    FY18:  Carroll County government funded $198M for the schools State and Federal governments added $151M to the school system CCPS' total operating school budget is $345M Carroll County's remaining operating funds are $201M to fund all other county services  (Public Safety and Corrections budget $48M, which is the next largest budget funded by the county)  In 2016 three schools closed.   CCPS' total budgets were: $329M in FY16  $335M in FY17  $345M in FY18  proposed FY19 $350M   That was a $20M budget growth over 4 years while 3 schools closed and the student population continues to fall from a high of 28900 students in 2005 to 25,290 students, or back to 1996 levels.   Under MOE, per student funding cannot decrease, so the more the county funds per student each year the higher the floor becomes.  As long as the student population is falling per student costs have less impact, but if the student population starts to rise MOE will force increased spending.","County tax collections are sufficient to cover needed expenditures but no amount is ever sufficient to cover wanted expenditures.  County budgets, like all other budgets in government are growing because government officials fail to distinguish between needs and wants.  Government must live within the means of the taxpayers.  It cannot continue to grow in size and expense while the private sector, which funds it, does not.  A supermajority vote is appropriate for raising taxes.  In a districted county as Carroll is, a unanimous vote to raise taxes would better protect an area of the county which may not have the wealth to support an increase in taxes.  The Commissioner of one less wealthy area may be out voted by Commissioners of the other more wealthy areas who do not care about the impact to residents outside of their voting district.  If Commissioners were elected at large they would all be accountable to all the residents in the county.  As things stand now they are not.","I oppose moving to charter government.   When proponents say charter is local control, taxpayers should hear 'they can raise their own salaries'.  Commissioners cannot.  Hardly the local control voters have in mind.  When proponent say it's separation of executive and legislative power, taxpayers should hear 'it adds an additional layer of bureaucracy on top of what we already have.'   We have 5 Commissioners, but charter has 5 to 9 councilmen and a County Executive plus the Executive's staff.  All to do what's already being done by 5 Commissioners, and was being done by 3 Commissioners just two terms ago.  When proponents of charter say it places checks and balances on government, voters should think about Frederick's Executive who consolidated power in her hands not allowing the council to speak with county employees.  Councilmen must go through her office, so she controls all the power.  This is not good government.  In Commissioner Government the Commissioners share power equally.  That's true checks and balances.   When proponents say that Commissioner Government is messy, voters should know all Commissioner Government decisions must be made in a public forum with discussion of the issues.  Not so in charter.  Open meetings are only required where there are multiple elected officials. County Executive decisions are made without public insight into the decision-making because one elected official has no one to meet with so no open meetings.  Pro-charter folks say government works faster with a County Executive, but greased wheels of government tend to roll over taxpayers.","Carroll County values its volunteer emergency services and all our firemen and women and emergency medical personnel.  Our communities come together every year around the carnivals, bingos and bull roasts that raise the money to help fund our fire halls.  The spirit of service is strong in Carroll County even if the numbers of volunteers are not always quite what we'd like.  That is a common problem across all volunteer organizations.    Incentives in the form of property tax breaks or community college discounts could be offered to volunteers and to local businesses that support employees volunteering.  Stepping up some of the existing benefits could also encourage more volunteers.    The school system should be encouraging service hours be earned in the fire halls. Creative programs that bring high school students into fire halls like the Volunteer/Cadet Program (V.C.P.) should be given more attention and support to encourage participate by high school students.  College tuition support could be earned by high school volunteers in these programs with the support of county funding.  A nationwide research project was conducted by VFIS Consulting to gain insight into why people are not volunteering as firefighters and how to bring more volunteers in.  Their practical conclusions are in a 90 page document that covers everything from advertising to leadership training, from evaluating potential benefits to the need for continuous recruitment. The methods outlined in this document should be fully investigated along with others before Carroll considers any move away from our valuable volunteer fire fighting force.","Many necessary measures to combat this particular drug problem are not within the power of the Commissioner's office, like training doctors to use less addictive medications or alternative pain. Or, bringing hope and a sense of personal value back by reintroducing God so people can better cope with pain.  Necessary things, but outside the scope of Commissioner.      Commissioners can support programs that have been effective, like the D.A.R.E. program, which was funded by the school system until 2013.  The Commissioners can urge the Board of Education to bring this program back into the schools.  The State Police facility in Warfield does D.A.R.E. training, so that should be a relatively easy thing for the schools.  Commissioners should support the Sheriff's Department and the State's Attorney's Office where they can in order to stopping illicit distribution of these drugs.  Accurate accounting and reporting of deaths and overdoses help raise awareness of the depth and breadth of the problem, where incidents are happening and which age groups are impacted so Commissioners can help getting that information more widely distributed.  They can also help the hospital get out information on alternatives to pain medications and what drugs create the greatest risk.  Carroll County government has a cable channel, sends out emails to various subscribers, has moveable billboards to place on roadsides, and regularly sends out bills all of which could hold or transmit informative opioid messages.    Raising awareness of how these opioid addictions start may keep some people away from them to begin with.","Should county government incentivize growth in the county through zoning and, if so, what types of growth (residential, commercial, high density, etc.) should the county focus on and why?

Zoning should encompass a healthy mix of business/commercial/residential uses while keeping taxes low for Carroll families.

We need to utilize our area for corporations and manufacturing opportunities with growth opportunities in tourism.

The supermajority ensures the decision to raise taxes is carefully considered and after evaluation of the county budget. The commissioners should be in agreement and take a hard look prior to taking money away from the working families who live in Carroll County.,"The structure of charter government could be beneficial to both the county and the taxpayer if it is properly implemented. Ultimately, such a decision must be decided by the voters by referendum at the polls.","The volunteer model of emergency services has benefitted the county and its taxpayers for many years.

The rural, farming aspect of Carroll County is why people want to live here and one of the reasons why we must protect our farmland. We have excellent ground that requires little to no irrigation to raise crops, thus reducing the drain on our streams and aquifers, which leaves more water for other uses. We need to take a closer look at why we want to grow and how and where we want it to happen. Growth is responsible for many of our problems such as water, wastewater and storm water issues as well as emergency services and safety to name a few.

To achieve that vision, I am for responsible residential and commercial growth. I am against high rises and high-density growth.  Growth should be in a reasonable way and not all growth should be dumped into the unincorporated area of Eldersburg. Each town controls their own growth and planning and the Commissioners should work  in tandem to fulfill each towns' own vision for appropriate growth. For Sykesville, Warfield is being modeled as a living/working community with residential areas and corporate headquarters with some smaller amount of retail. One of the development concerns is how to best update and utilize the historic buildings. I will work in conjunction with Mayor Ian Shaw to make sure that the development proceeds in a smoother manner. Sykesville Main Street merchants are sensitive to possible competition from Warfield retail. Hopefully a good partnership can be worked out and one of the ideas includes have a tram/trolley going back and forth to connect the two areas. The State of Maryland, Carroll County, and the Town of Sykesville have been working together over many years to see that Warfield comes to fruition.","I would encourage aggressive action to invite new businesses. When small towns were dying we took on the challenge in 2007 to turnaround Sykesville's main street, we turned Sykesville into the ""Coolest Small Town in America"". My Vision is to do the same thing to make Carroll the ""Best Place to raise a family"" which of course inculdes thriving businesses. So I would encourage utilizing a multi prong  approach to Economic development in the County.  Employers are looking for a pro-business environment where their business would be welcomed, and their employees would have good housing and good schools.  We also want Carroll to be a destination.  I am currently on the Pilgrimage task force which is mapping out ways to bring history to various parts of the state and Carroll has several locations. I will encourage our Economic Development team to take an aggressive approach to bring good corporate partners.  Several members of my team have high level positions in technology companies and would like to see more technology inside Carroll. We would like to see more technology companies locate here. One suggestion being discussed would bring a Data Center to Carroll.  Technology is an excellent growth area for the county. I will work to help make Carroll more pro-business.","If we want Carroll County to be the best place to raise a family, we want spectacular schools. We have very dedicated folks and we need to provide more resources for them to be most effective. We should have a better working relationship between the Commissioners and the Board of Education. When the starting salary for teachers was one of the lowest in the State of Maryland, it sent a strong signal that Education was not valued. I will work to make sure that does not happen again.  Much of the funding for education is formula based and mandated, so a set percentage would be nice but not practical. I have some unique funding mechanisms that I will be offering to increase resources. I currently have the backing of 3 current Board of Education members and the Teachers Union. I think that listening and understanding the plight of our very dedicated educators is the first step. As a former teacher and College administrator, I understand some of the issues that can appear in a classroom and additionally how colleges view various high school students seeking admission into selective colleges.  I am in the midst of visiting all of the Schools in District 5 to see and hear what are the current issues in each. I will also work to finally provide turf fields inside Carroll County.","During my 8 years on Sykesville's Town Council I never voted for a tax increase. Governments, just like any house hold, or any individual, can easily desire to spend more. However we do need more resources in certain key areas. An immediate need is to combat the Heroin/Opioid Epidemic.  I am fine with the 4-1 vote necessary to raise taxes. I would also like to have the public be able to have input on taxes and other issues with the ability to more easily bring issues to referendum. There are times when the public needs to be able to overrule politicians' actions or in some cases actually push them to act appropriately. Referendum action can be a powerful tool.","I will work to provide more access and responsiveness to our county residents. The current form of government for the county needs some updating. Our county residents need to have more input on issues. I will work to allow more opportunities for this input and also to more easily bring issues to referendum.  We have been very fortunate that Maryland has a Republican Governor that listens to the concerns of the residents outside of the politically powerful zones. This has not always been the case. Now maybe the best time to insure this freedom for the future. If we can provide more freedoms for Carroll County residents by making some changes and updating the form of government then I am all for it. If it is just another level of bureaucracy, then I am not for it.","With the need for two income families growing, I can see that the volunteerism for our emergency services is diminishing. I would like to see a planned and appropriate way to add professionals to this group. I would like to study how this has best been implemented by other jurisdictions and utilize the best practices to do so in an orderly fashion but still allowing the volunteers to participate with the appropriate training. In Sykesville, we have an excellent auxiliary police force with volunteers that augments the professional police force. Hopefully we can get to a similar place with our Emergency services.","We have an Epidemic in Carroll County dealing with the Heroin/Opioid crisis that our county folks have done a great job of slowing the progression of deaths. I am a big fan of what Tim Weber, Tammy Lofink, Brian DeLeonardo and the Sheriff are doing.  I have attended several programs in the High Schools, Community College and Libraries. I like the aggressive tactics versus the dealers and the offer of help to the victims. With my 22 years of experience in the medical arena, I have some additional ideas to implement.  We have not tapped all of our resources to combat this Epidemic.","Should county government incentivize growth in the county through zoning and, if so, what types of growth (residential, commercial, high density, etc.) should the county focus on and why?

Zoning is most effective when done at the local level by those closest to the residents impacted. Citizen input must be encouraged and respected. Zoning in Carroll County should respect the rural and farming character of the County while allowing for business and commercial uses where appropriate.  The best solution toward success is to encourage a healthy mix of business/commercial and residential uses by keeping taxes low and burdensome regulations to a minimum.  Growth in Carroll County must focus on smart development in areas where it makes sense and use caution to prevent high-density situations. A prime example of good development practices are sites like the Warfield complex which allows us to partner with the region and state for mutually beneficial growth opportunities.  The key to success is ensuring there is a vision and long-term strategy that is predictable and transparent to our citizens.","Our vision/strategy for economic development should be to grow a business/commercial tax base to ease the burden on homeowners. We can foster the type of industry that is a natural fit for Carroll while still supporting agricultural preservation and safeguarding our rural charm. Growth that pairs infrastructure and development while maintaining public support for keeping Carroll County the best place to live, work and raise a family is key. We must be proactive and encourage the types of businesses, retailers and entertainment options that citizens want to come here. Strong leadership coupled with transparency and open communication, building strong County-to-State and government-to-business collaboration, and taking 'real executable actions' are the criticalities to success.  Partnerships are key to meeting the desired end state. Keep in mind that business growth does not mean population growth!  I intend to use my experience coupled with current involvement in our community boards / commissions, AND most of all, listening to the community to develop the best courses of action. This approach will ensure a community that promotes growth while maintaining great cultural integrity. We ARE NOT and WILL NOT be an extension or outgrowth of neighboring jurisdictions.","First and foremost, there is nothing more important than our children.  Ensuring a safe and secure environment for them to learn in is paramount.  The budget for our schools goes well beyond that 47 percent.  Having a collaborative AND comprehensive budget is a must that involves the schools and other agencies that have a role in meeting the above requirements.  Priorities evolve over time and having the ability to appropriately adjust is a must.  The focus for the budget process must be requirements based and not on the percentages.  Specifically, as the requirements are thought through and developed by the Board of Education through their due diligence it is then presented to the Board of Commissioners for consideration and support.  This approach allows for the Board of Commissioners to support appropriately by having candid and open discussions of priorities, including most of all - student achievement.","We can always use more revenue sources; however, that burden must not be placed solely on the individual.  As stated above regarding economic development, Carroll County has a great opportunity to bring in businesses that will encourage a strong educated workforce to stay in place along with being the right fit for our community.  These efforts will provide additional revenue sources for our County.  The supermajority to raise taxes is one of the best ideas ever implemented in Carroll County.  As stewards of public funds, Commissioners must agree before raiding the wallets and pocketbooks of hard-working families in Carroll County.  It is the job of the Commissioners to make tough choices and decisions when crafting a budget and changes to this process should never be a reactionary approach.","I am running for Commissioner representing District 5 in Carroll County; therefore, I support our current form of government.  Charter government can work if done properly and does not increase costs to taxpayers when correctly implemented. We have seen charter government work successfully in surrounding jurisdictions. I respect that approach.  In Carroll County, it is ultimately up to the voters to decide if and when it is time to move towards charter government; however, I do not believe that time is now.","Enabling legislation is a good first step in the discussion of where emergency services are headed in Carroll County.  In order to retain our deputies we must find the financial resources to pay them a competitive salary and benefits as well as providing necessary equipment and training. Supporting CCVESA and individual fire companies is critical.  Crafting a hybrid volunteer/paid model via dialogue with current volunteer fire companies is an excellent way to create a bridge to future EMS needs in Carroll County without overburdening taxpayers. Taking the appropriate steps for County oversight will allow better resourcing in the budget to support law enforcement, fire and EMS.","It is unacceptable that we still have an opioid and drug problem in our community. County government must work in conjunction with state, federal, municipal officials and law enforcement to end this crisis.  The one thing we cannot do is put our collective heads in the sand and say more money will fix things. It needs all of us looking out for each other, educating ourselves and our families to provide a holistic solution.  Funerals of twenty-something Carroll residents from overdoses are far too frequent and are totally unacceptable.  As Commissioner, I will fight hard to combat the scourge of opioid addiction.","Should county government incentivize growth in the county through zoning and, if so, what types of growth (residential, commercial, high density, etc.) should the county focus on and why?

The county worked long and hard on a master plan which passed in 2015 and we are currently working on the Freedom Plan for the Sykesville/Eldersburg area. These plans assure we are placing importance on future growth in the best manner possible. Our 8 municipalities have designated growth areas as well, and the county needs to continue the positive working relationship with them as they plan for the future. We are blessed to be one of the leading counties in the nation for agricultural preservation. We should promote orderly and balanced growth to assure we maintain our rural setting with agricultural preservation, our heritage, but assure we also have affordable housing for young families. Growth in the correct areas will promote the balance we enjoy. We are also currently upgrading our zoning regulations which is critically needed. Carroll County has and will continue to work with our state to assure compliance and provide reasonable alternatives in the event mandates are overly restrictive.","Carroll County enjoys a thriving economic growth and development atmosphere,  and since I have been in office it has increased each year. We are the leading county in the state in new light manufacturing. Job growth and retention are important and that starts with a well educated and trained work force which allows our businesses to choose from the best pool of employees, supporting our career tech center and Carroll Community College to assure local job and education training reaches our local job market. High standards in education and a safe environment with the right infrastructure are also important factors. It is important for our economic development department to remain a department in our government structure. I represent Carroll County on the Economic Alliance of Greater Baltimore and the Baltimore Metro Council. This outreach with colleagues around the region pays dividends. Best practices and strategies continue to be the driving force as well.  Streamlined permitting procedures should also be maintained to assure opening a business, whether small or large, remains easy. From our main streets to our commercial areas, we continue to realize progress and Carroll County is truly open for business.","Carroll County enjoys a top rated school system, including the lowest drop out rate and highest graduation rate. This requires investing in education in the most fiscally responsible manner possible. Over the last 3 budgets, that I have worked, including the current budget, education spending has increased each year. Many public schools costs are variable and not fixed. Healthcare, transportation, utilities, etc., are constantly changing. It is my expectation that the needs brought forth by our school system and Board of Education are presented in the most fiscally responsible manner keeping students and schools based staff as priorities. There should be no reason, with creative thinking, that our schools can not meet their needs with this percentage. The proper set percentage should be dedicated annually.  As a life long resident of Carroll County, I have many family members involved in our schools. Investing in education is one of the most important budgeting decisions we must make to assure the positive future of or children and the positive aspects it brings to our communities. My family and grandchildren depend on it.","We must continue to live within our means. With our location in the metro region comes a responsibility to maintain our citizens quality of life and delivered services by local government. We are rural but we incur expenses differently than many of the rural counties based on our location. Correct utilization of funds will lead to fiscally responsible spending. Our bond ratings depend on sound reserves and fund balances. With an improving economy, higher assessments and the uncertainty of the affects of new tax laws, I would not entertain any increases. As long as I am in office, the supermajority remains. This most crucial decision depends on it.","There are several forms of charter and to immediately assume that switching would be a budget buster is not correct. The five Commissioner format was the decision of our electorate and should be allowed to prove its efficiency as this is only the second group.  I am becoming increasingly concerned about the way in which we make decisions by needing permission from Annapolis on issues that we know best. One example of this is the enabling legislation for our Fire and Emergency Services. Having jurisdictions decide our future is not the best practice. I would entertain, that in the not to distant future, we should examine code home rule, which would allow decisions such a this remain in the hands of our elected folks and maintain our Commissioner form of government. We must, however, put the right group of Commissioners in place who work together, communicate with staff, constituents, and legislatures to make the best decisions.","With over 42 years in public safety this issue remains near an dear. Our volunteer fire companies are the hubs of our communities and we must continue to assure they remain including their autonomy. As we continue to see challenges in public safety, which is the most important obligation we have as elected officials, as it pertains to increased need, the right manner to proceed is crucial. Establishing a structured command staff, and infusing personnel in our current stations establishing a top rated combination system is the way to do this. We must also work with our 14 volunteer fire companies to ensure all are on the same page as we combine goals and objectives, for example ambulance billing, as we move closer to a combination system. This will not happen overnight and I applaud the efforts of the committee put forward by the Carroll County Emergency Services Association, as we are in the incipient stage. Working together we can achieve our goals.","This is a critical issue, one in which I have been involved with from day 1. Along with one of my colleagues, I put together the Not in Carroll initiative in 2014 that remains in place. This led to increased funding for our Sheriff and States Attorney and they continue to see great strides in our ability to fight this crisis. All of our partners from the Health Department to our non-profits to our hospital to our schools, and the list goes on and on, must team with us as we continue to provide funding and strategies moving forward. I am a member of the Senior Policy Opioid Group in Carroll and am appointed to the Governors Emergency Management Advisory Council. Through the efforts of these groups and their outreach we are realizing some success. We must continue to take a leading role on all of the efforts in combatting this epidemic including prescription and street drug abuse. An escalating drug problem directly affects every aspect of life not only in our county, but across our great state.","Should county government incentivize growth in the county through zoning and, if so, what types of growth (residential, commercial, high density, etc.) should the county focus on and why?

While zoning is one issue that impacts this growth, the more limiting factors are access to water, sewer, good transportation routes, and high-speed internet.   The 2014 Carroll County Master Plan which was adopted in February 2015 identifies areas where some limited rezoning could be practical.  These areas, as well as many already zoned for commercial and industrials uses, are in compliance with state-mandated requirements as they are located in Designated Growth Areas.","The strategy for economic development in the county should be multi-layered.  The county has in place several agencies and programs  that have been successful in working with large companies  such as Fuchs North America and Knorr Brake to build and expand in the county by having ready-to-build lots and securing low interest loans through the State. The Miller- Resources for Entrepreneurs center at Carroll Community College aids smaller businesses in starting and growing.  Additionally, past zoning changes for agricultural uses, such as allowing wineries that are open to the public have helped agricultural businesses stay viable.   I think consideration should be giving to additional non-traditional uses of agricultural land such as allowing a certain percentage of a property be used for ground mounted solar panels or other sustainable energy production.  Incentives to other businesses might include the expansion of water and sewer lines where feasible and temporary loans or grants to help with the initial set-up costs.  Employers, however, also want to locate where there is a dependable workforce and in an area where their families can take advantage of good schools and other amenities.  Therefore, assuring that our schools and infrastructure remain in good condition are also important to attracting new businesses.","The percentage of the county's budget dedicated to the Carroll County Public Schools (CCPS) has decreased several percentage points over the past few years.  While the actual dollar amount is more important than the percentage figure, the expectation should be that the commissioners value the CCPS and are committed to funding it accordingly.  One advantage of setting aside a percentage of the budget is that there is not a dollar for dollar decrease in county funds when State funds are increased.  For instance, if the State provides additional funds for school safety initiatives or from casino profits, the county should not use these funds to offset funds provided from property tax revenue or other county contributions.  Setting a percentage could help ensure this doesn't happen.  If a percentage were to be set, I think 50% would be a good starting point for discussion.","For the time being, the operating budget can be balanced with the existing revenue given some adjustments in funding allocations.  There are funding items into the future that will considerably stretch the budget, including the funding of LOSAP and competitive salaries for sheriff deputies, teachers, and other county employees.   Continual attention must be given to improving our economic development and working with our state delegation to ensure we are receiving our fair share of State funds. As to requiring a super majority to raise taxes, I think this was an unnecessary action but I am not looking to change it.","There have been several attempts during times of rapid growth in the county to move to charter government.  While this move may be feasible at some point in the future, I do not think it is practical at this time.  If the time does come, there are ways to structure the charter government to achieve varying balances of power between the county executive and council persons.","The best path forward would be to maintain the current system of paid EMTs and engine drivers, along with the firehouses primarily staffed by volunteers.  However, the reality that this may not be possible needs to be acknowledged. Long range plans must include the possibility of adding more paid positions.  At a minimum, volunteers should not have to pay for their safety equipment and required training.  I would encourage the Board of Commissioners to work with the Carroll County Volunteer Emergency Services Association and others to determine the best way the county can help all its emergency services personnel and ensure adequate fire and emergency services into the future.","The government should play a supporting role in combating the opioid epidemic.  Our States' Attorney's office,  Sheriff's Department,  local police departments,  public school system, and non profit agencies are working on a multitude of initiatives and programs.  One of the most pressing issues is the lack of treatment facilities, even for those directed to attend one based on a drug court ruling.  County government could facilitate coordination between the many agencies working on the epidemic and determine where county funds can do the most good, particularly where they can leveraged for additional resources through grants and expanding existing programs.","Should county government incentivize growth in the county through zoning and, if so, what types of growth (residential, commercial, high density, etc.) should the county focus on and why?

Zoning should be a mix of residential, commercial, industrial and employment campus designations. The counties' state approved ""Master Plan"" is the blueprint for growth focus.","Carroll County is the leader in Maryland for growth regarding companies specializing in manufacturing. Our economic development program, working alongside the Maryland Department of Commerce has worked collaboratively to develop over 1000 jobs in the past 2 years.  In the future, the development of employment campuses, the Harrison-Leishear Industrial Park, the North Carroll Industrial Park, and the Warfield Commerce Center will lead to further industrial and high-tech development. Carroll County is continually striving to develop an industrial tax base to take the pressure off residential tax-payers.","A set percentage allocated to public school funding is not a sustainable practice for budget development. A plethora of variables will always exist when funding education. Presently, our school system is experiencing a major decline in enrollment which has led to a decrease in state funding. The county has had to supplement this financial gap for the past 4 years to the amount of $29 million. We are faced with schools in need of physical upgrades, teacher salary increases, and keeping curriculums and curricular resources updated in order to maintain the best possible learning environments for the students of Carroll. We presently fall short of the financial means to properly fund our public education system. We hope that by working collaboratively with our state delegation, and by employing forward thinking, financially responsible approaches we can meet the needs of our school system.","Currently, existing revenue sources to effectively cover necessary expenditures in Carroll County is a daunting task. We are faced with issues including infrastructure maintenance, keeping police, school and county employee salaries competitive, maintaining parks and recreation facilities, and navigating facilities uses including county buildings and surplus schools being returned to county control. We also have an increased demand for non-profit organization funding as well as making meaningful investments in programs to combat the growing issue of opioid abuse.","Throughout my previous four-year term as commissioner I believe we have seen very positive results from 5 individuals working in collaboration to develop policy for the county. Presently, this system is the most efficient form of government for Carroll County. As our population grows we may inevitably reach a point when charter government could become the most logical and effective form of government for Carroll.","Enabling legislation in the Maryland General Assembly gives Carroll County the authority to provide funding for our volunteer fire departments. Currently, 14 individual fire departments hire emergency EMT's and the funding we provide to CC-vesa is distributed to help provide funding for paid EMT's and in certain cases, firefighters. We are at a critical point where our volunteer workforce cannot adequately provide fire and EMT services 24 hours/ day, 7 days/week. My hope is that we work with the volunteer organization and the 14 departments to cultivate a plan to fund and assist these companies in critical areas. I absolutely do not want to usurp any authority from our volunteer fire companies. These individuals are pillars in our communities. My sole objective is to provide relief for these companies so they can provide the best possible services for the citizens of Carroll County.","The most effective tool in the battle against opioid abuse is prevention. Carroll County's responsibility is multi-faceted. First, an education program must be the basis for elementary, middle and high school students as well as adults. Educating our medical community is also paramount to the sustainable success of reducing instances of opioid overdose and general abuse. Additionally, addiction must have programs which act as an alternative to incarceration. These programs include drug court, day reporting centers and counseling services. Success will hinge on a collaborative effort between the Sheriff's Department, Carroll County State's Attorney's Office, non-profit organizations, and private organizations. No one entity, including the government will solve this problem alone. A combined, well-articulated and focused effort is our best chance to effectively stop these abuses.","Should county government incentivize growth in the county through zoning and, if so, what types of growth (residential, commercial, high density, etc.) should the county focus on and why?
