We need to ensure our communities are well taken care of, but we also need to facilitate new development, but not at the cost of forgetting about what we have already committed ourselves to (the community that is here now).   As far as dedicating time and resources to develop small area plans, that depends on where, how many, how long, and how much that research and development will cost the county. We are not flush with spare funds and we need to keep a watchful eye on our spending. However, keeping certain areas in mind when generating the Development Plan, potentially even drafting up a few small area plans will be worthwhile and give the community something to look forward to close to home.   By limiting the small area plans to just a handful, we can alleviate some of the additional burdens it would take to make small area plans for every community, while still keeping in line with a focus on specific areas that are desperate need of attention.","The cost of materials for schools keeps increasing, and unfortunately that tends to sap budgets of any wiggle room we may have once had. Personally, I think our teachers are like our farmers, providing the nourishment we need as a society. However, the crops they grow are intangible. Yet, given that we bestow upon them a huge burden to cultivate the minds of our children, we seem to think that their pay should not match their responsibility.   I support a return to step increases based on a time-in-service and performance-based structure. Advancements ought to be meritorious in nature, but we will need to assess as a community, paired in discussion with our teachers and Teachers Association to figure out the best way forward. However, as we spend more in salary, we may need to address some other area of the community's budget to migrate funds over from.  Additionally, this will also mean we need to address first and foremost the issue with pension payments draining the county's general fund. It will be a challenge to get the step increases reinstated, but it is something I am committed to pursuing.","As many voters in Anne Arundel county, I own my home. Thinking of increasing my tax rate that I pay in addition to the mortgage seems unfathomable. I know that times often get tough and we need to band together as a community to support education (yes, even if we do not have children ourselves) and public safety, and infrastructure. However, we still need to keep in mind not all citizens are going to be able to afford a property tax increase. Not only that citizens may not be able to afford it, it will encourage residents to move to other counties, or even worse, other states if we do not maintain a competitive property tax rate.  If critically necessary, raising the tax rate a fraction, and only temporarily, it could be leveraged in extreme circumstances. However, I am much more a proponent of finding other avenues of income for the county.

That being said, we don't need to start from scratch. First of all, we have cut the Department of Planning & Zoning to such an extent that they don't currently have the staff to re-do all 16 of the SAPs. Second, even if we had the appropriate level of staffing, to really do the SAPs well the county would have needed to start the process a couple of years ago. What I believe should happen is that Planning & Zoning should create a scorecard for each of the SAPs that shows which parts of them have been accomplished and which parts have not. This could then be used as a jumping off point for informing the new General Development Plan. Moving forward, Small Area Planning should be made an integral part of all future General Development Plans and Comprehensive Rezoning processes. Getting input from each of our communities is vitally important and it is really disappointing that it was not done better this time around.","Absolutely. The answer is an absolute ""yes."" There is both an efficiency and an equality component to this. In terms of efficiency, our veteran teachers who stuck with us through the recession are not making a competitive salary when compared to what they could make in surrounding jurisdictions (this is true of all of our teachers, but the situation is accentuated for our veteran ones who are multiple steps behind where they should be). We are losing more and more of them each year and their experience is irreplaceable. In the long run in would be more efficient, and more fiscally responsible, to pay the makeup steps and retain these teachers instead of spending the money on recruiting and training their replacements. In terms of equality, a new teacher with less experience can be hired in our county and make thousands of dollars more than a more experienced teacher that was loyal and stuck with us through the recession. Stop and think for a minute about how being treated so unequally could affect teacher morale. A public education is the cornerstone of a thriving democracy, and the backbone of any public education system is good teachers. We need to ensure that all teachers, and especially our veteran ones, feel valued by our county. Right now this is not the case, and a great step towards changing this dynamic is to make up the steps that were missed during the recession.","I don't want to pay a dime more in taxes than I have too. They say that we millennials have three mortgages: student loans, private childcare, and a housing payment. This is definitely the case for my family and me and so again, I don't want the government to collect any more revenues from us than is actually needed. That being said, I do want Anne Arundel County to collect enough revenue to provide county residents with the level of services that we both need and deserve. This includes having adequately staffed schools, police, and fire departments as well as paying these public servants a competitive salary when compared to other jurisdictions in the DC-Baltimore metropolitan area. To do this we will need more revenue. It's just math. The first way to bring in new revenue is to raise development impact fees to 100% of their true cost. This will free up the portion of our budget that we are currently using to subsidize development. Second, is to consider ways to have tourists pay more for their use of our roads and for being protected by our public safety departments. Third, we need to stop giving corporate welfare in the form of multi-million dollar tax breaks to already-profitable big businesses. However, if we are honest, we will have to end up looking at restructuring the tax cap.

Zoning affects the quality of life for citizens of Anne Arundel County. Small area plans allow neighbors of a small, contiguous, discrete area to interact directly with County planners on issues important to the area and what is needed to maintain or strengthen the member communities. For instance, the Broadneck Small Area plan spends a significant amount of time discussing Route 50 and Bay Bridge traffic concerns. If county employees do not live on the Broadneck Peninsula, and have no reason to travel there to regularly engage citizens, they could not adequately understand the enormity of the issue without regular first-hand accounts. Citizen participation in decisions that affect how and where the county grows and develops should be encouraged. The County should develop a meaningful and impactful Small Area Planning process.","Absolutely yes. With our current inadequate teacher salary scale and appalling history of not restoring step increases to teachers who went without during the recession, Anne Arundel County Public Schools (AACPS) is not a competitive employer for teachers in this state. Our County teachers currently suffer the indignity of working for an employer that pays new teachers with the exact same level of experience more money because they were not here to miss steps during the recession. Frankly, this situation is unconscionable. Teachers are a cornerstone of our democracy- they help us have a well-educated citizenry who will vote and participate in our society. Teachers who stayed through the recession are owed an apology and restoration of their steps. The County's school performance has precipitously declined since teachers have lost their steps. AACPS for the first time has no nationally ranked schools. We are ranked as low as 12th in the State for education, despite being one of the wealthiest jurisdictions in the State. The New York Times cited Stanford University researchers when it stated ""In Maryland's Anne Arundel County, third graders test above the national average. But growth there [between third and eighth grade] lags behind Chicago [Public Schools], where the poverty rate is about five times higher."" AACPS students between 3rd and 8th grade do not progress as much as students in Chicago Schools. If we want great schools in Anne Arundel County, we need to value teachers and pay them a competitive wage.","For 20 years, I have worked for the State of Maryland optimizing billions of dollars' worth of government expenditures. I would be remiss in making such a declaration without first examining the County budget in depth. Just from the publicly available budget and financial documents, I have learned that the school system ended the fiscal year on June 30, 2017, with a rather sizable surplus. Also, from 2015-2018, administrative expenses for County Schools increased 35% and the County spends proportionately more on administration than our more successful peers. For instance, in real dollar terms, the County schools spend approximately $11 million more on administration than Montgomery County. So, there may be opportunities for efficiencies that would transfer spending from administration to more mission critical items in the School budget. Additionally, the County has previously turned down federal grant money that would have hired 52 new and desperately needed firefighters.

In fact, it would beneficial to perform an audit of the Small Area Plan recommendations from our GDP of over a decade ago. As I study the Glen Burnie Small Area Plan of 2004, it is clear that many of the recommendations have never materialized. Convening a group of community members to work on a new vision for the Greater Glen Burnie area is a must.","I am a strong advocate for increased compensation for our Teachers in Anne Arundel. I am also a strong advocate for reducing our class size issues which will require hundreds of additional teachers. The budget process for funding our school system requires the Board of Education to make a formal budget request, the County Executive to allocate funds, and then County Council can only add additional funds by taking from other categories. Any County dollars allocated for Instructional staff in the school system budget then go through a collective bargaining process between Board of Education and Teachers Association of Anne Arundel County. The County Council does not have the authority to dictate how budget increases for teachers are dispersed. Those details must be negotiated.",I believe we can meet our needs within the county by maximizing revenue within the legal confines of our county tax revenue cap as well as leveraging opportunities for public/private partnerships and state/federal grant opportunities.,Should the county develop small area plans as part of the upcoming General Development Plan and Comprehensive rezoning process?,The Teachers Association of Anne Arundel County continues to advocate for a return of step increases given up during the 2008 recession.

Community involvement is essential for the future.","Yes, I think the County Executive should fund step increases that were lost. The County Council cannot add to the budget. The County Executive needs to provide funds to help teachers catch up.","Yes, I believe we should tax to the current cap. Unfortunately, several members of the current council and County Executive want to provide additional tax cuts.
