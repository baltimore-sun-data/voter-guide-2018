I guess he has kept us out of War,  which would be his best accomplishment. He has also not been indicted for bribery or tax issues. He  was more successful than his mentor Ted Venetoulis  able to collect salary of the County Executive for eight years before failing to become Maryland Governor.  His greatest Failure was his lack of service as a County Executive ,he served eight years as a candidate for Governor of the State of Maryland . he led the County to actually lose the entire Southeast County to become a Republican stronghold something even Spiro agnew failed to accomplish.","I feel  the resources can be found without a tax increase,however we need a complete audit with consequences. I mean elimination of corporate welfare  recall some of the tax incentives.  Trade Point Atlantic and Greater Towson deal needs audit and possibly  cancel some of the sweetheart deals that were given away, which might call for legal action. .The new Baltimore County which many of  globalist Hedge funds & developers plan of Baltimore County is geared for should be examined with possible criminal action. The supposed 10,000 new jobs that will pay average of $30,000  former Gov O'Malley & now Johnny O take pride in selling to citizens has a serious downside. O'Malley, Kamenetz  & Blake knew that the going minimum wage was supposed to be $15.00 by 2020 when they first working with Hedge funds shut down the Point. They promoted South east Baltimore  would be so much better off instead of  $7.25  jobs & $20,000 jobs around  Sparrows Point their NEW developers promised $30,000 a year jobs by 2020. I said it then in 2011, they were basically promising to destroy the entire Point and replace it with minimum wage Roll on Roll off car drivers . They weren't lying Baltimore County was in on the Johns Hopkins social engineering for the Newcomers .$15.00 an hour x 40 hours is $30,000 yearly. I need to get in there and reorganize our priorities.","No I don't .This program was pushed unsuccessfully by Venetoulis, kamenetz mentor, it isn't a discrimination stopping program, it is  a developer based program that intentionally using  presentation skills paints a picture of discrimination. I feel it's even misunderstood by those vocally against it. People   should realize , great Urban Development of Baltimore County that Kamentz celebrated , fifty years recently is basically  same blue print  used to create apartheid in South Africa. They used plans to let the workers mine & build the great cities but kept them in certain areas, some where there families were only allowed to visit, plans also were used for the Gentrification in Portland, right out of  Baltimore County playbook. Folks, since Clinton's there has been work going on to create a new place for refugees in America, for the political and hedge fund investment  ,they have well written plans by many great people, grants etc. come with plan. Northern Baltimore County will stay rural,& southeast & west  Baltimore County will feel the growth. They protect rural Baltimore County with  successful apartheid rules, substituting sewage rules to limit building. Many of these vouchers weren't going to inner city residents, again they are used, plans like these  developed nationally  call for new middle class, many  non English speaking Newcomers are the targets of those vouchers. Hispanics don't realize, like inner city blacks, illegal refugees are targeted to get these vouchers.","No ,we need to overhaul the system we need to call out the MSDE Bullying and lies which force the testing and misuse of students & teachers time in the class room to get private companies wealth .","We can utilize the many advances in building restoration and provide incentives for individuals to restore houses to retain significant building envelopes of many houses and incorporate the modern efficient HVAC & lighting innovations to make existing houses last another 60 to a hundred years. The amount of small businesses we could create that could grow out of LOCAL residents getting employment starting small companies where younger and older people could get hands on retraining in building skills that could transform lives and give people the pride to start over .Renovated housing by small companies should get tax incentives and grants ,we should seek to bring in National companies to try out new products in local businesses.","The society has broke down because the priorities and requirements of policing has broke down. In an overly no faced development community large builders have drawn up the laws it seems towards littering,tresspassing and taken away recreation.The Recreation of citizens 15 through 55 is neglected as a targeted community by Baltimore County .This county in the Fifties & sixyies was the model for Education/Recreation facilities with Schoolds being planned as 24 hour community centers .Somewhere in the mid to late seventies Recreation started losing many fields and buildings and principals became kings of the school castle. This was compounded by the success of the Programs for aging which basically took the funds out of Recreation & Parks to form the Department of Aging. Combine the Department of education increase & the Department of Aging and the Senior Centers the Department of Recreation is a sham for people between 15 years of age and 55 year. We need a commitment to space creating volunteerism and use of facilities so that more Drop in ,pick up leagues are started throughout the county. BCPD shouldn't be used to CHASE people away  they should be used to provide safe locations where all no matter how they dress ,color ,age want to come hang around and enjoy our county .The MOVE ALONG  ,Cattle Rustling we force our police to do now creates a vacuum that will be filled ,BY GANGS .","No , this needs to be looked at ,the amount of people squeezed into certain areas 90 % living on 30 % of the land is wrong if the tax incentives & laws to develop the 30% of land is given to NEW building instead of smart renewal. We need to look at stopping creating developer millionaires and billionaires and create a self sufficient county. Instead of forcing use of every part of 30% land open space in the county being developed redevelopment should take place. we could build the county as a tourist center and I feel that Trade Point Atlantic agreement should be opened up for inspection. Is that the best place to put Under Armor & Amazon? if it is why aren't they paying there freight. There are new designed cities that we might be able to use that land as a manufacturing tax income producing site. plus Amazon & Under armor should pay for the infrastructure improvements or let me find some companies that will. It would serve better as a car maker or steel maker than a minimum wage low income job producer. You can do many things without the dreaded pollution that developers use to scare away innovation. Folks we have been had ,10,000 new students are all pretty much refugees, those of us who lived here are forced to move on by PLANNED low paying jobs","Baltimore County suffers from the lack of support for it's cultural institutions. We have had eight years of an executive pandering for the city vote in his role for governor. We should build a partnership where tourists plan their visits around visiting Baltimore County and Baltimore City. Baltimore County has NO respect for tradition. Allowing Towson State College to disband one of the USA most historic Soccer programs was a sin that must be changed. Towson Soccer had a major part in saving the US during World war II to see academics belittle the contribution so that most of Baltimore knows nothing about it's contribution to saving the United States Army is a total tragedy. We need a combined effort to rebuild Baltimore City by building up Baltimore county as a tourist location ,it must stop being land of the PUD which always seems to favor the developer.","Yes ,fact is Baltimore County is underserved by planning of jobs. We need a development of more jobs in neighborhoods it shouldn't be just a landing pad for cheaper housing for them working in Wash ,Virginia. We need a government that wants to build Baltimore County for Baltimore County residents ,show off what we already have redevelop areas we already have ,the whole Middle River area development should not be only apartments and townhomes. make neighborhoods  increase recreation and make this a county for the people not the developer.

When faced with an enormous and daunting task with regards to renovating our schools, the Kamenetz administration forward funded key necessary projects and prioritized education. The greatest failing of the Kamenetz administration was some of the pension decisions made with regards to pension double dipping for certain county officials. I am proud to have passed legislation correcting this and eliminating pension double dipping.","Before raising taxes Baltimore County must explore creative and alternative sources of revenue. Last year, I passed legislation allocating a portion of our already existing hotel tax into Baltimore County tourism. Studies show that for every $1 a jurisdiction invests in tourism, the return is $25. By redirecting an already existing revenue source to reinvest in our own tourism, we are investing in ourselves and creatively generating new revenue that our County so desperately needs. This is one way to fund important projects such as school construction.","I believe we have significant housing inequity and poverty concentration in Baltimore County and support the idea that we must address this inequity to solve the County's increasing poverty levels. I was raised by a single mom, who worked three jobs to keep a roof over our head, and I know first hand the struggles that vulnerable county residents are faced with everyday. I am committed to tackling this inequity head on, with all parties at the table. I am a consensus builder, and when faced with a problem as challenging as Baltimore County's housing consent decree, I understand that the best way to address it is with all parties at the table to work towards a solution.","As County Executive I will give greater audit power and control to the auditor's office to grant them oversight on BCPS contracts. With such a significant portion of Baltimore County's budget being justifiable allocated to our school system, I believe we have a responsibility to tax payers to be sure their money is being spent wisely-- this includes BCPS contracts over a designated amount of money.","Through our planning department and our economic development department, I know Baltimore County can be proactive and effective in preserving and revitalizing our aging communities. As County Executive, I will establish a separate department for economic development to ensure we are being proactive in revitalizing our communities through community grants, while utilizing and expanding our planning department to identify and protect those communities that require greater preservation efforts. I believe strong leadership finds balance, and when it comes to maintaining and protecting Baltimore County's most sacred treasure, our communities, it is important to invest significant resources to preserve and revitalize them.","I believe the relationship between police and community should be consistently evolving. As a 30 year community activist and volunteer, spending many years volunteering with the Baltimore County Police Department and within the School Resource Officer Program, I have seen first hand the significant impact a positive police relationship and presence has within a community. From serving as mentors, to preventing violence, police officers interfacing with community is a positive. As County Executive, I will work with leadership in our police department to implement community policing and will set a precedent for police to get to know the individual community they serve so they can adjust to the needs and cultures of that community. This will result in the best outcome for our communities and our officers.","I am a strong advocate for maintaining the URDL, and protecting the rural land outside of the URDL while focusing development and growth in the appropriate areas inside the URDL. In order to have strong communities, Baltimore County must offer residents the amenities they crave, however it is important to focus those amenities in designated areas. I believe that our zoning policies and our Urban-Rural Demarcation Line serve our needs and accomplish those goals when implemented correctly.","The cultural institutions in Baltimore City are another part of what makes Baltimore County a great place to live, work and raise a family. These are amenities that the people crave. We certainly do not do too much in this regard. I wish that we could do more. It comes down to balancing competing priorities and not asking the people of Baltimore County to dig too deep in the pockets. Baltimore County has done generally done a good job of balancing these priorities. It is not unlike what we do in our own lives, when we are short on money the first thing that is taken care of are the basic needs; and when we have periods of greater prosperity we spend more money on the wants and amenities. I think we always support these cultural institutions and the level of support will be somewhat dependent on the financial position of the county.","No and neither is the entire region. If we want to be less oil dependent as a country, we need 21st Century mass transit systems. If we want to have less traffic congestion, we need a 21st Century system. If we do not want to spend more money acquiring more land for more roads and widening the ones we have, we need a 21st Century system. The biggest failing of State officials over the last 4 years, has been the redirection of money from mass transit to roads and the loss of billions of dollars in Federal funding that other states would die for.

His administration spent unprecedented dollars modernizing schools and solving overcapacity issues across the county at the elementary and middle school levels. At the same time, he significantly invested in our aging water and sewer infrastructure. I am most critical of the Kamenetz administration on development issues. The pay-to-play policy of rewarding developers based on political and financial donations was a hallmark of the Kamenetz administration. Projects were often presented to communities as ""done deals."" Decisions, negotiations and sales were decided behind closed doors. The Kamenetz administration did not scrutinize development projects based on merit. Time and again communities felt left out of the planning process and surprised by announcements of major projects without community input. In Baltimore County, there are two sets of rules: one for select developers and one for everyone else. In zoning decisions, my administration will prioritize projects based on the impact on communities and what effect these projects have on the environment and open-space. As County Executive, the planning office would be charged with scrutinizing projects for their impact on traffic, school enrollment, and the environment. I will encourage transparent discussions between our County Council, community members, environmentalists and developers. We need sensible development in Baltimore County.","Baltimore County, according to the Spending Affordability Committee report issued in February, will experience debt pressures primarily because of the aggressive school construction campaign. Using a portion of the continued expected surpluses for one-time expenditures along with sensibly planned budgets, we can continue to address overcapacity at the high school level and maintain and modernize our schools. Furthermore, the Kamenetz administration forward funded projects that have not yet received state matching funds. I do not see the need to increase the property tax or the local income tax.","I will follow the law and introduce legislation as required. I do not support any legislation that requires Baltimore County landlords or tenants to be at the mercy of the Baltimore City Housing Authority because of the well-publicized corruption and scandals that plagued the Baltimore City Housing Authority. I am committed to providing affordable and fair housing across our County through our Baltimore County Housing Office. For any new large-scale developments in Baltimore County, I would support a percentage of the units being marked for affordable housing. Furthermore, my administration will support an incentive based ""Live Where you Work Program"" to encourage that our teachers, police officers and firefighters are County residents. I am committed to expanding the Baltimore County Veteran Housing Program, and the Baltimore County HUD Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing program.","The Board of Education is the primary mechanism for oversight of the Baltimore County Public Schools. As a state Senator, I was the lead sponsor in the Senate of the bill that created an elected school board. I believe that rigorous checks and balances are necessary in the oversight of their schools. By passing this legislation, we have empowered voters to have a say in their school system. As County Executive, I propose having our County auditor review all major school contracts. A second independent review would improve the integrity of the process and help restore public trust in BCPS. I would ask BCPS for a comprehensive 10-year capital construction plan, and a review of scheduled maintenance of existing buildings. The County Executive's primary role in the support of BCPS is to provide funding. As County Executive I commit to having our schools sufficiently staffed and supporting our teachers, who are the heart of our school system and connect with our students every day. Additionally, I will fund more guidance counselors, social workers, and teaching assistants. I want to invest in and expand the AVID program to give more students opportunity, and expand vocational programs throughout our high schools, as these programs provide employable skills for our graduates. I support community schools that help our most vulnerable students and their families be better prepared to learn with access to social, health and educational services. All of our students deserve to spend their days in safe, healthy and innovative classrooms.","As County Executive, my mission is to showcase the diverse economic possibilities of Baltimore County. It is critical to retain our current employers and their businesses by creating established lines of communication and infrastructure support. We need to retain our current companies and encourage their growth. Our neighborhood downtowns need to be supported to attract restaurants, small businesses, and quality grocery stores and to promote arts and cultural venues. Our suburban corridors like Reisterstown Road, Liberty Road, Security Blvd, Route 40, and Merritt Blvd need to be redeveloped. Our Office of Economic Development needs to offer economic incentives to establish midsize businesses along these routes. I am committed to continuing the Baltimore County Boost Fund that supports small businesses, particularly those owned by minorities, women and veterans. I am committed to revitalizing Trade Point Atlantic. This incredible land site needs to be showcased for innovative commercial use. I will encourage partnerships between our local universities to retain the incredible talent and ideas incubating in these institutions. I will be ever mindful that businesses are attracted to strong communities and high of quality of life amenities. My commitment to developing smart public transportation patterns, creating affordable housing, maintaining our strong schools and educating a career-ready workforce will make us more attractive to future employers. I will collaborate with the private sector, seek State support and financing, and charge my administration with aggressively seeking out commercial partnerships to keep Baltimore County strong.","I think the relationship between the Baltimore County police and communities is relatively strong. However, I want to ensure that Baltimore County police are better-staffed and well-trained. A police force is only as good as its incoming cadets. We will invest in recruiting locally and nationally. We will build upon the current tuition reimbursement for all Baltimore County Police officers, and professional staff members. Enhanced education and training makes for better police officers. We will offer incentives to have police officers live in Baltimore County, as living where they work will give officers stronger ties to the communities they serve. I commit to adding 16 additional police officers distributed along the four major corridors of Baltimore County. With these new positions, we will step up foot and bike patrols in downtown business corridors and initiate routine patrols in our neighborhoods. We will support the training of additional Student Resource Officers at all levels of our County schools depending on school size and need. In coordination with BCPS and our police force, we will continue to determine comprehensive security measures for our schools. At our Baltimore County police stations, we will emulate what they do in Anne Arundel County. When someone has a substance abuse issue and is ready for treatment, they can come to a Baltimore County police station and they will be met by a caseworker and get treatment for their addiction. Our incredible Baltimore County police understand that fostering relationships with communities is crucial to ensuring safe neighborhoods.","As one of the leading environmental advocates in the Maryland Senate who has previously received the endorsements of the Sierra Club and The League of Conservation voters, I believe preserving and protecting open-space is a fundamental responsibility of good governance. I believe in rigorous land preservation above the Urban-Rural Demarcation Line. We are fortunate that 2/3 of our land in Baltimore County remains rural. Our agricultural resources and commerce are an important economic asset of our County. This forward thinking environmental practice allows the focus of our commercial and residential development, and redevelopment, to occur in every council district. Supporting our inner suburbs is vital to Baltimore County's economic growth. I want to ensure that every neighborhood has green space, parks, and rec fields for the enjoyment of the community. Every neighborhood should have a buffer zone, so traffic from the major corridors does not infringe on our quality of life. Across the Country, and in neighboring counties, park space is being revitalized and designed in creative and purposeful ways. Our administration will be pioneers in re-imagining what our public parks can be.","Traditionally, the Baltimore County budget spends three million dollars to support arts and cultural institutions in Baltimore City. It is important for Baltimore County that we continue to spend these funds, as we are stronger as a region when we provide our citizens with world-class museums, theaters, symphony, cultural venues and landmarks. Baltimore City provides our County with regional arts and cultural institutions that our students and residents enjoy. My administration will work with Baltimore City to find opportunities to expand our regional partnership. Also, we must spend additional dollars to support the emerging art designations of our Baltimore County communities and foster cultural experiences in Baltimore County. Opportunities to participate and appreciate drama, music and visual arts enrich our students' education and are a source of community pride. These occasions need to be made available in our recreational centers, main streets, schools and college campuses. The inherent value of culture and arts to our County from our regional partners and our homegrown institutions contribute to our quality of life.","No, Baltimore County is not adequately served by mass transit. In order for Baltimore County to comprehensively address our mass transit shortage, we need to work with our regional partners to find solutions. My administration would work closely with the MTA and State Department of Transportation to establish additional and convenient bus routes. Also, our current schedules need to be more reliable and efficient. Our residents need direct routes in order to improve their daily routines. Our County is large and residents need the means by which to move around it. Working with Baltimore City on a modified red line project could dramatically help our transportation network. In this effort, I would work closely with the State and Baltimore City to develop a plan. Economic growth in Baltimore County is predicated on the assumption that workers can get to their jobs. Students need to reach their schools and campuses on time. Time spent in long commutes on buses is time spent away from worthwhile pursuits. Also, under my administration, we would include increased and safer bike lanes into our Master Plan. I will prioritize smart transit planning. Future development must scrutinize the impact on traffic and congestion. Fostering livable and sustainable communities is the ultimate goal of my administration.",What do you consider the greatest accomplishments and failings of the Kamenetz administration?,"Does Baltimore County have adequate resources to meet its needs, particularly to renovate or replace aging schools?

In addition to serving as a member of the Baltimore County School Board and a BCPS teacher, I served in the Maryland House of Delegates for nine years, representing southeastern Baltimore County. My time in the House included four years as Chairman of the Baltimore County House Delegation, and I am the youngest person ever elected to that position. I also served as a transportation official for Baltimore City, advocating for a better regional transportation system including the Red Line project. For the past three years, I have served as a software executive focused on leveraging big data analytics to help local and state governments make smarter decisions to better serve their citizens.",https://gojohnnyo.com/,JohnnyOlszewski for BaltimoreCountyExecutive,johnnyojr,http://surveygizmoresponseuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/fileuploads/296249/4299880/179-886e253a3cb8e8bcc1119bf078e73205_Johnny_O_%281%29.jpg,"Baltimore County, under the current administration, has started addressing the much-needed and long-overdue investment in our public school system. Adding air conditioning and hiring new support personnel are important first steps. As executive, I am committed to finishing the job. I have unveiled a bold education plan that calls for another $2 billion for school infrastructure, a 20% raise in teacher pay and hiring even more support personnel like school counselors, social workers and pupil personnel workers. The Kamenetz administration also took the necessary steps towards ending housing discrimination in the county in seeking to pass the HOME Act. As the only candidate who supports the change, I plan to keep up the fight and finally get it done. On the other hand, there have been more tepid steps taken and opportunities missed to make Baltimore County government more open, accessible and transparent. While I applaud the launch of the BaltCoGo app, something for which I've been pushing since launching my campaign, many additional reforms remain overdue. Chief among them is the creation of a small-dollar public financing program for local candidates that takes special interests out of our elections. Other needed changes include putting more county awarded projects and services, as well as budget details, online in an easily searchable way, holding multiple budget hearings throughout the county, and moving County Council work sessions to the evening. Finally, Baltimore County needs a performance management system -- publicizing our goals and keeping our government accountable on its progress.","As a former member of the Baltimore County Board of Education, teacher and father, I understand firsthand the needs of our schools and am prepared to do whatever it takes to meet their needs. As I have traveled the county, touring our schools and speaking with our educational professionals, it has become clear to me that we have not dedicated the adequate resources to meet our remaining needs. We must make investing in school facilities a priority. Children continue to learn in schools with brown drinking water, and support personnel remain anywhere between two and ten times behind nationally recommended ratios. Just one example: it's recommended that there be one social worker for every 250 students. In Baltimore County, each social worker is responsible for well over 1,000 students. Raising taxes should be our very last resort, but every option needs to be on the table, including development impact fees. As executive, I will focus on growing economic development, leveraging public private partnerships, and getting our spending priorities right. Since our school system has spent $300 million on computer technology and our county government provided a $43 million subsidy to developers, there are certainly opportunities to redirect current spending to meet many of our educational needs.","Discrimination in any form is wrong, and I have fought strongly against it during my time in the legislature, adding my voice as a deciding vote in the push for marriage equality and fighting for other equality measures. In the race for Baltimore County Executive, I am proud to be the only candidate to support ending housing discrimination by supporting the HOME Act. To make our county truly prosperous, we need to not only end discrimination, we must also work to deconcentrate poverty and create economic opportunity. I support the consent decree and will fully enforce it as county executive, but I'll also go further,taking action to improve equity beyond housing. In addition to better housing practices, we will promote equity within our educational system, public sector workforce and job training and placement services, and transit. Everyone who calls Baltimore County home will be proud of the progress that we make together.","Under an Olszewski Administration, we will set the standard for transparency and accountability for county government and our school system. Given the incredible investments made by the county government in education -- almost $1.7 billion in FY 2018 -- the county government can and should exercise additional oversight over the school system, beginning with an independent and comprehensive audit of school system spending. As executive, I'll undertake a comprehensive audit of county government to identify fraud, waste and abuse and will include the school system in this effort. I'll work with school board leaders to ensure that contracts for both the county and school system seek to avoid ""no bid"" contracts as often as possible, making them the exception rather than the rule. As I create mechanisms to make more budgetary and award information available online, I'll push the school system to follow our lead. Additionally, I will provide the resources to either add staff and expand the existing authority of the Baltimore County auditor's office or create a new county inspector general's office. With either approach, we would grant independent authority to investigate any indication of inappropriate activity within Baltimore County government or our school system. I'll also establish a direct liaison between my office and the superintendent of schools and school board so that there is regular and ongoing dialogue on the issues impacting our system.","The success of our county will be dependent, in part, on our ability to revitalize our aging communities. As we run out of new spaces to develop, finding ways to creatively redevelop parts of the county will be essential. This includes creative ways to revitalize our historic main streets. The county plays a critical role in this work, though it can not preserve and revitalize our aging communities alone. Where we can act, we should. This begins with having a comprehensive and customized plan for every neighborhood in Baltimore County. All of these plans should emphasize innovation, entrepreneurship and creating a strong community culture. In certain areas of the county, such as Catonsville, Pikesville, Towson and Dundalk, we should create Arts and Entertainment districts to encourage success. In fact, I am pleased that the County Council has chosen to act on my campaign calls to finally create the first A&E district in southwest Baltimore County. We also need to work with our anchor institutions such as our universities, hospitals, and federal agencies. Both Towson University and UMBC have strong business incubator programs, but we aren't fostering an environment for their start-up businesses to anchor in the neighboring communities. Another shortfall is the gap in service on the east side, where no such incubator exists. As executive, capitalizing on these opportunities will be a priority. Finally, quality schools and safe neighborhoods are the best tools we have to support and sustain all of our communities, whether brand new or aging.","Safety is paramount. Moreover, safety and law enforcement are personal for me: my youngest brother is an officer in the Essex precinct. After trending downward for years, crime is rising again in Baltimore County. While some types of crime continue to fall, violent crime and the opioid epidemic are on the rise, posing two unique challenges for law enforcement. Violent crime jumped nearly 15 percent from 2016 to 2017, with some precincts like Essex seeing as much as a 32 percent increase. The opioid epidemic is ravaging communities in Baltimore County, with opioid-related overdose deaths tripling from 93 in 2011 to 305 in 2016. We will move toward more intensive community policing and bring police athletic centers back as a focus of investment in our young people and collaboration between the community and law enforcement. We will also provide additional cultural and field training in cultural sensitivity and de-escalation so that officers are better equipped for the many circumstances they will face in the field. I'll continue to improve the technology accessible to our officers and will put more officers on the street. An Olszewski Administration will provide our officers with the resources to be proactive and cultivate a police-community relationship built on trust, communication and collaboration.","The URDL has proven to be an effective tool for county planning, preserving the majority of county land. In fact, 90 percent of the county's population resides on just one third of the county's land -- a testament to the URDL's success. Despite this success, we have fallen short on ensuring enough open space on the line's urban side. Development has grown too dense in parts of the county, resulting in limited open space and overcrowded schools. This demands attention, and I'll work towards establishing zoning policies that prevent over-development and target smart re-development in the aging communities where it is most needed. Additionally, our revitalization and enterprise districts could stand to be bolstered. While the county's east side enjoys a widespread enterprise zone, we underutilize the zoning tool on the west side. Similarly, we should make greater use of Arts and Entertainment districts, revitalization districts, and historic districts to create more opportunities for investment with specific community development goals.","Baltimore County is more vibrant and successful when we have strong artistic, cultural and athletic opportunities. While I applaud the support for cultural institutions of Baltimore City, we need to do more. An Olszewski Administration will invest more in the museums and performing arts venues that improve the quality of life and vibrancy of our entire region. That being said, Baltimore County is and should be much more than a bedroom community. We have a rich history here of our own, and we should also invest in cultural and artistic opportunities here. In addition to increasing funding for cultural institutions in Baltimore City, I will cultivate new opportunities to celebrate our history, culture and tradition in Baltimore County.","No. A strong transportation network can invigorate an entire region, creating jobs and connecting people to opportunity. The needs of Baltimore County residents are not being met with our transportation options. That is one reason why I was the first candidate for executive to have called for the creation of a stand-alone Department of Transportation for Baltimore County. In the years ahead, we must find ways to connect Baltimore County to the rest of the region more meaningfully. While the cancelling of the Red Line was a missed opportunity, we should consider more options for East-to-West transit and other ways to connect one side of the county with the other. We also need better transit options with communities like regional Circulators, which we can pilot in Towson. Baltimore County needs a big vision on transportation and a county executive who can provide that. Indeed, so much of what needs to be accomplished in Baltimore County by a new administration, while a matter of resources, is also in the first instance a matter of being committed to a bold vision for the county. I am the only candidate who is showing a commitment to tackling the county's education, economic development, and government accountability issues by going beyond the status quo and and taking bold actions.",What do you consider the greatest accomplishments and failings of the Kamenetz administration?,"Does Baltimore County have adequate resources to meet its needs, particularly to renovate or replace aging schools?

As such, it is clear that there is no long-term plan, or multi-year budget. The Kamenetz administration does not communicate through the county administration. County employees typically have no idea what the vision of the County Executive is, or where they are headed. There is no long term plan and poor communication has resulted in low employee morale. County employees don't believe anyone is listening, or that anybody cares. Other than development issues, the County Executive has been disengaged from County operations. Most aspects of leadership and decision making have been neglected by the County Executive and delegated with little accountability or oversight. His greatest accomplishment has to be staying engaged with developers for development projects.","I do not support raising taxes. However, it will take strong leadership to create a vision and long term plan to address the pent up demands and problems long ignored Our administration will work with elected officials and community leaders to identify all existing needs; we will quantify them, prioritize them, and create a multi-year budget in an open, transparent process that addresses the needs of each community. We will create the Office of Inspector General and review/audit every aspect of county government, and identify operational inefficiencies and as mentioned, create a plan to turn the inefficiencies into effective and efficient benefits for the County. I have been doing this for decades. I also believe that having a County Executive that collaborates with Governor Hogan, instead of being an adversary will benefit the citizens of Baltimore County. I am the only candidate endorsed by Governor Hogan for Baltimore County Executive which will allow us to leverage additional state resources.","Noâ€¦. I oppose the consent decree and the process in which it was negotiated. It should never have been executed without community and County Council approval. I don't believe it is a statement of rental discrimination. Government should not be able to force independent home owners and businesses to partner or do business with anybody, including government. This is a property rights issue and therefore, should be a free market business decision. Additionally, nobody has ever alleged or produced data verifying that there are not an adequate number of property owners that do accept vouchers. Again, which is an independent decision by property owners.","Noâ€¦.. while the County Executive does not control the board of Education, the County has a fiduciary responsibility to make sure that the County dollars are being spent efficiently and wisely to benefit the education of our children. This is another area where the County Executive has been disengaged and has ceded everything to the school system. As County Executive, I will be visible in the schools, communicating with teachers, administrators and parents. I will be engaged in education issues in ""real time.""","The County can assist in making sure that businesses are not overburdened by senseless regulations or high taxes and fees. These Mom and Pop small businesses are the jobs creators and strong businesses can help the surrounding community thrive and reduce blight. Additionally, the County needs to identify ways to make smaller, infill developments more cost effective and lower the unit cost. These communities may hold redevelopment/revitalization opportunities.","We have terrific police officers in Baltimore County. The problem is that local police precincts have been stripped of the officers that they need. The County Executive has a history of creating specialized police units, and staffing them with officers that are pulled out of community patrols, which has created a shortage of officers in the community. We need to add and/or redeploy police officers so that they can go back to local community patrols.",I support the Urban-Rural Demarcation Line. Zoning and Development policies need to preserve our agricultural and rural areas and emphasize the stabilization of older communities and targeted growth,"Based on my current knowledge of the County budget and resources, we cannot increase support to Baltimore City. Financial support needs to be part of the county-wide analysis and long term plan / budget. Baltimore City would benefit from such a plan too so that they could redeploy resources where needed.",The BaltimoreLink seems to have assessed the needs of Baltimore County pretty well. The State also continues to tweak the system based on ridership and job opportunities. For example the BaltimoreLink just expanded lines to create new service to Trade Point Atlantic to provide more people with job opportunities. This should be a continuous improvement process that should be evaluated on a regular basis instead of waiting decades like previous Administrations to make changes.,What do you consider the greatest accomplishments and failings of the Kamenetz administration?,"Does Baltimore County have adequate resources to meet its needs, particularly to renovate or replace aging schools?

His greatest failings, like all career politicians, are what he has been willing to do to become elected and the subsequent compromise in representation he visits upon the average citizen taxpayer as a result.","On paper the resources may be there, but our politicians traditionally play Jenga with all infrastructure, not just schools. They habitually divert money or outright siphon it off to projects that benefit their political operatives and careers until the system can be depleted no more. In response to declining services and eroding infrastructure, the frustrated voter seeks a candidate willing to fall on the sword to fix it â€” often by raising taxes. The public then faces the other side of this coin: dismayed at the price tag of not only maintaining but also simultaneously restoring the infrastructure, the taxpayer reacts like a rat in a cage â€” with only two parties to choose from, they without fail will re-elect the same people that depleted the system, this time running on a cost-saving platform, thus perpetuating the vicious cycle. The question is not more or less taxes; it is responsible taxes with honest oversight of the public trust.","In principle, from a legal liability position for the county, I support the decree... I understand it. Nonetheless, regardless of how citizens fund their housing or have their housing funded, I am not a fan of rental properties, vouchers, and/or subsidies as a way of life. Living wage jobs for people of all levels of education, aptitude, and IQ is what makes housing attainable and affordable and creates strong communities. Living wage jobs allow people to purchase on their own behalf and develop the mindset of being invested in a neighborhood, which stabilizes their community at large and eliminates the need for subsidies or decrees to keep housing attainable and affordable in the first place.","The school system, representing approximately half of the county budget, has itself become an industry where people seek employment making a living wage to prepare students for living wage jobs that do not exist. Baltimore County needs more living wage jobs for people of all education levels. This creates greater family investment and community involvement in the schools systems through greater citizen at-large input and feedback. Residents that have strong ties to an economically thriving community will take a lead role and serve as the best facilitators of a strong education for their children. A well run school system is made up of administration, faculty, students, and parents collectively.","Even more so than good schools, fostering and maintaining the safest, most crime-free living environment possible will draw people to build, invest, and renovate. When this is incentivized by strong public safety policies and services, the community members will reflexively and collectively build a strong community association in conjuction with the thriving economy that is stimulated by revitalization. Likewise, the public and private schools, homes, and businesses in these areas will be of highest priority to the community residents who will take a more active role in improving every aspect of the community exponentially.","I have nothing but good to say about the Baltimore County Police. With a true leader in policy making like myself in the executive office, their best is yet to come.","Zoning is always a contentious issue, but certainly Baltimore County has a very good format in place for addressing these issues. The challenge remains to empower more honest people to preside over these forums, processes, proposals, and their associated issues.","None of the above. Rather, from my perspective Baltimore County does not have a well defined cultural support system.","The question is: does our current mass transit have any appeal other than to people that have zero alternative but to rely on it as their sole means of commuting? The answer is a huge NO! In many other countries, mass transit is clean, safe, inexpensive, convenient, and thus is utilized by people of all backgrounds and financial means.
