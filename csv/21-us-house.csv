,YES,Representative in Congress,3,Adam D. DeMarco,DeMarco,10/19/1985,Baltimore,Democratic,Baltimore City,http://www.electdemarco.com,demarco4rep/,adamdemarco,http://surveygizmoresponseuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/fileuploads/296249/4299807/253-0b94e7fad0edfe267e4e24cc3cfdc507_Demarco-6357.jpg,"I graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point, NY, with a Bachelor of Science in Business Management. I then received a Master of Arts in International Business and Policy from Georgetown University, in Washington, DC.","After graduating from West Point, I served as an active duty Army Officer training, developing, and leading America's sons and daughters, both stateside and during multiple combat deployments. I then transitioned from active duty service into consulting, where I worked for one of the largest professional services organizations in the world, working with both federal and commercial clients across the United States. During this time, I also became a small business owner focused on helping local, rural, economies by providing go-to market capabilities within the wine industry. I'm also an executive board member for several non-profits within the greater Maryland region—which focus on supporting wounded warriors and serving our military service men and women. Finally, I elected to continue my military service in the United States Army National Guard, where I am a Major supporting domestic emergency responses for the Federal Emergency Management Agency.","The past 14 months of the Trump Administration have proven to be some of the most divisive, regressive, and dangerous months of any administration in modern day history. During this administration, we, as the United States, have abdicated our position as a leader in the global community and have transgressed 21st century global power to a 20th century isolationist country. However, while I disagree with the Trump administration, I also realize that across our cities, towns, and communities, thousands of Marylanders continue to struggle. And in that spirit, I understand that civility and discourse is needed now more than ever. So, while I don't agree with the administration, I am also willing to come to the table to negotiate and find common ground so that our neighbors, friends, and families, are able to continue to build towards their American dream. Our country needs a new generation of leaders now more than ever. Leaders that will represent honorably, legislate with integrity, empathy, and compassion. And leaders that will serve selflessly.","I strongly condemn and oppose the federal tax cuts passed in 2017. My first contention is that this tax bill was not only a gift to corporate lobbyists, but it was essentially written by them. Of the just under 11,000 registered lobbyists in Washington, DC, more than half—6,243—are reported to have worked on this bill. For instance, in 2025 the individual income tax rates are set to expire, meaning that Congress will then have to pass further legislation to either increase or decrease the rates. However, corporations have no expiration date. Meaning, that when the full ramifications of these rates are felt by working Americans, it is on their backs and in their paychecks that the Congress will pay for these mistakes. Which brings me to my next contention which is that any tax cut is essentially a gamble on the future. And every non-partisan think-tank asserts that the generation that is going to be hit the hardest by these cuts are the millennials—which ironically make up the largest generational demographic in America. The problem is, the millennial generation is now entering a workforce in which starting average wages are lower than those form 1970 (adjusted for inflation) and furthermore they are entering this workforce with an average of over $30,000 in student debt. So not only are future generations at a severe disadvantage, but now they are going to have to pick up the tab for the Republican tax gift to corporate donors.","Because of our national debt, we are unable to fully fund the most important basic services and agencies that support our neighbors and communities. While our government will purchase billions of dollars-worth of defense contracts, it can't even ensure that every family, veteran, or disabled American has a roof over their heads. Our national debt is a grave concern to me not only because of the misappropriation of funding, but because our legislators simply forget that they have an inherent fiduciary responsibility to tax payers; and to see that their tax dollars are spent not to secure their re-election campaign, but to provide the most basic of rights and services to every American. Which is why I am running a campaign that is not actively fundraising, and most notably operating on less than $20,000. Not because I can't fundraise, but because I have chosen not to. I want to show every Marylander that not only can I run a competitive campaign on limited resources, but I can do the same with our government. Everyone talks about being ""fiscally responsible"", but how many Congressional Candidates have actually proven it? And that is the same focused responsibility that I serve in office with as your next Representative in the United States Congress.","The exponential rise of economic inequality across the United States is a huge problem that is eroding our middle class. In summary, and having studied this problem, economic inequality is the root for many of the issues we see across the United States. From education, to healthcare, to poverty, and crime, the main basis for many of these issues relates back to the lack of wealth dispersion across socio-economic classes. How can we fix it? I, along with Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz, believe it's rather simple; jobs. While the unemployment rate reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics may seem relatively low, what it doesn't show is the under-employment statistics; meaning the number of people working yet receiving lower than market wages. As I've said previously, average starting wages today are lower than those from 1970. These stagnant wages, with increased costs of living, have been a catalyst for this growing economic divide across the country. In order to combat this, our government needs to provide jobs programs aimed at allowing citizens to attain, retain, and thrive in 21st century family-wage paying jobs; which is exactly what my ""JoLT 21"" jobs program is designed for. Until then, and as our workforce continues to be underpaid and undervalued, the dispersion of wealth will continue to polarize, and the inequality across our society will further deepen. Which is why it's imperative that our next Representatives in Congress not only address this but have a plan to fix it.","As a combat veteran, and responsible gun owner myself, I believe that our current gun laws are out of date. In the wake of the most recent school shootings, I've had the opportunity to speak with students from across Maryland, whether at the 'March for Our Lives' demonstrations or at local town hall forums. In talking with them, one thing is certainly clear; they are sick of the status quo of nothing being done. The first part of solving any problem is first realizing that there is one; America has a gun problem. In Congress, I will sponsor and support responsible gun safety legislation that reinstates the ""Assault Weapons Ban of 1994"". Having served in the United States Army, and continuing to serve in the Army National Guard, I believe that assault weapons have no place on our streets or in our communities. They are designed for one thing and one thing only; combat. I will also support and sponsor any legislation that outlaws any and all weapon modifications that allow semi-automatic weapons to be turned into automatic weapons of war, and legislation that bans high capacity magazines.","The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 was a monumental step towards ensuring that all Americans are have the right to quality and affordable healthcare. However, and just as President Obama has stated, that it's not a perfect system. The ACA is just the first step towards ensuring that every American, regardless of age, race, gender, or socio-economic status is able to see a doctor and receive treatment and preventative care. I believe that we must continue this fight towards universal healthcare for all. It's a tough challenge, but when the number one reason for family bankruptcy across America is due to soaring healthcare costs, or when a mother has to decide between purchasing prescription drugs or groceries for her children, or when a sick patient is faced with death because their insurance won't cover their treatment, then this is a fight we must be willing to take on. Healthcare is a universal right for all, and as your next Representative in Congress, I will fight to make that a reality.","The federal government must allow states to govern, and for cities to thrive, with only minor interference from the ""invisible hand"" of the federal government. That said, when cities begin to fail and our citizens begin to suffer, it is the impetus and duty of the federal government to step in and provide resources to rebuild and revive those institutions. In the case of Baltimore, which has unfortunately more than our fair share of civic issues, this could be a case study on the opportunity for the federal government to revive the once bustling economic engine of the Mid-Atlantic region. In these cases, the federal government should establish a ""Tiger Team"" comprised of representatives from each governmental agency to not just study, but implement revival strategies and investments. These teams should be independent of local and state officials as to not be influenced, and as a means to provide outside and third-party consultation. The results of such will not only rebuild and revive cities, but in many cases will provide for new ideas, new initiatives, and new investments to help bring cities like Baltimore back into the 21st century.","The current opioid epidemic across the Country is very reminiscent of the crack epidemic of the 1980s. If there's one lesson to be learned in how to deal with this situations, the first thing is that mass incarceration is not the answer. Congress must develop and implement new, 21st century, solutions to this ongoing epidemic. In a recent survey, nearly 52% of Marylanders reported of knowing someone who has or had an opioid addiction. However, these rates are not isolated to only Maryland, or specific to only the United States. In the 1980s and 1990s, Germany was plagued with very similar statistics in terms of opioid addiction rates and overdoses. Yet today, many of their cities can be considered a beacon for how to handle these drug epidemics. Several of the measures emplaced in specifically in Frankfurt included counseling services and points of contact, run by authorities, health care services, religious communities, self-help groups, and other drug addiction specialists. Additionally, in 2009, German authorities offered a controlled supply of diamorphine, a substitution therapy for longtime addicts covered by German health insurance. Their solutions to addressing these problems went against the conventional wisdom of conservative factions and law enforcement, however, the statistics of their success is proof that these types of modern day solutions can, and will work. Our Congress needs to adapt to the 21st century, and bring 21st century solutions to our current problems and crises.","First and foremost, Congress must pass legislation to provide a path to citizenship for the 690,000 ""Dreamers"" in America through no fault or choice of their own; of which Maryland has approximately 10,000 of. America was, is, and forever will be the land of opportunity. And as your next Representative in Congress, I will ensure that nothing ever infringes on the inalienable rights of life, liberty, and happiness for all. As the great-grandson of an Italian immigrant, who came to the United States when Italians were amongst some of the most heavily persecuted and discriminated ethnicities, I try to imagine what life was like in the early 1900s for he and his young wife. I can't begin to imagine the struggles they endured once they arrived at Ellis Island. And your next Representative, I will fight to bring our immigration and deportation laws and policies into the 21st century. We must have common sense immigration reform, and reduce the bureaucracy associated with a path to citizenship. But that said, we also need to reform our vetting and tracking systems to ensure the mechanisms with which people come into our country are those who will be contributing members of our American society. I firmly believe that we can have common sense immigration laws, while being empathetic and compassionate at the same time; as they are not mutually exclusive.","As I have studied at length international business and policy, I understand that many of our trade policies are vastly outdated. As a country that now exports more services than products, this imbalance is due in part to the unregulated workforces in countries like China, Vietnam, and Thailand. By that, the cost of producing a product in the United States is higher than producing in a country like China, mainly because in the US we have labor standards, health standards, and workers rights standards that must be met. In China for instance, they don't have these requirements and therefore the cost to produce goods, or the costs of goods sold, is much lower. Understanding that, in order to have free and fair trade policies, the United States must understand that bi-lateral and multi-lateral trade agreements must be revisited on a consistent basis. I believe in free trade, all the while promoting fair trade. In order for us to protect American workers, promote our values, and ensure level prices, we must ensure our trading partners are enacting and enforcing labor laws and standards for their workforce. In doing so, this provide incentives for off-shored companies to move back stateside, and rebuild our vanished manufacturing base.","I agree with and support the Iran nuclear deal, as do all permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, along with our key allies in the Middle East. Many critics argue that this deal will provide a pathway for Iran to develop nuclear weapons; but that simply isn't the case. The mechanisms placed by the United Nations and the International Atomic Energy Agency provide for transparency in Iran's nuclear energy programs, and limits the use for key components in developing nuclear weapons. Additionally, as do many of our other European key allies, I believe that relieving many of the sanctions on Iran can actually facilitate better relations with this country and be a gateway to solving many of the problems we and others face across the globe. The era of cold war politics is over, and we need to understand that while we can be firm and resolute in our beliefs and convictions, we must also aim for global prosperity and peace through diplomacy.","The rise of North Korea's nuclear program, along with their threatening rhetoric, is one of the greatest existential dangers we face in the United States. And therefore I believe the United States must ensure our security and safety and advocate for the disarmament of North Korea and the abandonment of their nuclear program. The United States should leverage trade agreements and sanctions with countries that conduct trade with North Korea until a permanent treaty of non-proliferation is agreed to, and signed by North Korea and allies of the United States. Additionally, our relationship with South Korea should be the catalyst to bring all parties to the table to negotiate such a treaty. Until that point, we will continue to face the threats poised by the North Korean Dictator, and continue to face the uncertainty caused by a radical, nuclear, tyrant.",How do you assess the Trump administration so far?,Do you support or oppose the federal tax cuts passed in 2017?

I have a Bachelor's Degree in Public Administration from Southwest Texas State University, and I studied Economics at the graduate level at University of Oklahoma.","I am a retired Military Intelligence Officer. I served 20 years in the U.S. Army, including three deployments to Bosnia and time on the ground in Iraq. I started my Army career as a Company Clerk, then was trained as a Korean Linguist, then was selected for Officer Candidate School and became a Military Intelligence Officer. As an Officer, I served multiple deployments in Bosnia, where I think we did a good job, a one tour on the ground in Iraq, which was so frustrating that I submitted my retirement. I have worked at the Pentagon for 14 years, advising on Army Intelligence issues, and gaining valuable experience in dealing with Defense budget processes. For the past four years I have also served as the Director of Operations for a green energy research company, Avertica, which has been granted two patents for our conductive polymer technology which could be used to improve solar panels and for advanced energy storage.","Abysmal. The current administration is moving in the wrong direction on nearly all issues. The President has always owned his own company and he appears not to understand that that he is now a paid employee of U.S. citizens. His chaotic approach is designed to avoid oversight. He uses WMD (Weapons of Mass Distraction) to avoid responsibility for his actions. He ignores verified intelligence from government sources in favor of rumors from television and social media sources which leads to bad decisions. I would vote to impeach President Trump today based on his multiple violations of the Emoluments Clauses. He is profiting from his office, both charging the government for services in a conflict of interest and by taking money from foreign governments as they pay above market rates to stay at his hotels. As a Military Intelligence Officer, I will await the outcome of the Special Prosecutor's investigation to confirm or deny evidence of any criminal conduct regarding the Russians. Congress needs to serve as a check on the reckless actions of this administration. Congress should repeal the current Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) which is overly broad and instead specify what limited military actions they authorize. On issue after issue, this Administration is moving in the wrong direction. I oppose the Tax Bill. We need to fix our Health Care system, not gut the ACA. We need to protect our environment, while the Administration is rolling back those protections.","Oppose. Any short-term benefit will be more than offset by the long-term damage of increased deficits. This tax cut is a give-away to richest among us, with 82% of the cuts going to the top 1% of the population. But the resulting debt is shared equally by all citizens. The majority of this $1.5 Trillion tax cut goes not to U.S. voters, but to corporations. 35% of U.S. stocks are owned by foreign investors, so the tax cut gives a large gift to foreign interests, while saddling American taxpayers with debt. The corporate tax cuts are permanent, while the small share that goes to human beings is only temporary. Much attention has been given to corporations who have announced bonus for worker, but real wages continue to lag far behind inflation. Annual raises have been used to address inflation, but now bonuses are often used in lieu of those raises. While the raise would endure year after year, the bonus is a one-time event. This gives the appearance of benefiting workers, but that benefit is short-lived. We may need to increase the deficit during a recession to jump-start the economy, but the economy is improving and this additional stimulus in not appropriate. We have many other urgent needs to be addressed, to include infrastructure, health care and education. A huge tax cut at this time is irresponsible.","Yes. We may need to increase the deficit during a recession to jump-start the economy, but when we are experiencing economic growth, we need to pay down the national debt. To address the deficit we should: • Repeal the 2017 federal tax cut which adds $1.5 Trillion to the deficit. • Close corporate tax loopholes, particularly the tax breaks which subsidize companies for moving jobs overseas. • Tax capital gains at the same rate as earned income. We should reward work, not punish it. • Address the excessive volatility in our stock market caused by machine trading by putting a small tax on stock and bond trades, perhaps a penny per transaction. We also need to address the spending side of our budget. Defense spending now accounts for 57% of our discretionary spending, which is more than we can afford. We need comprehensive Defense Acquisition Reform to reduce spending while speeding up the procurement of equipment and materials. Current bureaucratic procedures in the Defense Department mean that it takes at least 7 years from identifying a needed capability before we can get equipment to the troops that need it. This is unacceptable and adds to our defense costs. We need to streamline the acquisition system, reducing the administrative processes, to make the system more efficient. I am the only candidate in this race who has experience with the Defense Budget processes and has the skills needed to accomplish this reform.","Yes. Inequality in both wealth and income is higher now than at any time since the Great Depression. This high level of economic inequality results in slow economic growth, because it limits the demand for goods and services. When a working person gets an extra $1,000, they spend the money, which creates additional demand that translates into more jobs. Those additional jobs provide money for more workers, who further increase demand for goods and services. This ""multiplier effect"" is highest for workers who spend most of any new funds immediately. When a wealthy person gets an extra $1,000, they are already purchasing all the goods and services they can consume, so the multiplier effect is zero. The wealthy person may invest the money, but right now interest rates are low showing that there is no shortage of investment capital. They may invest the money overseas, producing no benefit to our economy. To address this, we should start by increasing the minimum wage to at least $15 per hour to lift wages as the first step towards providing a living wage. The government should close the tax loopholes which are making economic inequality worse, as mentioned in the above response. We should raise the marginal tax rate on high income earners (over $1 Million per year). They are clearly benefiting the most from our system, so they should help to pay for it. We should increase the cap on income subject to the Social Security tax to strengthen and expand benefits.","Yes. We need to do more to improve gun safety. I believe you have a right to own a firearm, unless you are a criminal or mentally unstable. But with that right comes the responsibility to prevent criminals and mentally unstable persons from obtaining firearms. That is why the Second Amendment refers to the need for a ""well-regulated"" militia. We need host of changes to our current laws, including: • Universal background checks, every time a gun changes hands. • Mandatory registration of firearms • Reporting of mental health issues to the background check system • ""No Fly, No Buy"". If you are too dangerous to get on a plane, we should not sell you firearms. (I support a right to due process, so falsely accused persons can appeal their listing on the No Fly List and have a hearing before a judge.) • When a Temporary Restraining Order for domestic violence is issued, firearms should be removed from the household • Create a process for obtaining a Mental Health Temporary Restraining Order, where persons who are experiencing depression or other mental health problems can be evaluated for risk of suicide or violence • Training on weapons safety for purchasers of firearms","Health Care is a Human Right. I support H.R. 676 MEDICARE For All. I joined the Army when I was 19 because I had a son who was born premature, weighing only 3 lbs., 10 oz. I needed heath care which would cover that preexisting condition. the only way to get that coverage was to join the Army. I do not think anyone should have to put their life on the line to get health care for their sick child. The part of our health care system which is working best is MEDICARE, which is taking care of our seniors. We should build on what works. Let's expand MEDICARE so it covers everyone, regardless of age. Currently 35 to 40% of our health care dollar goes to administrative costs. MEDICARE has administrative costs of about 3%. MEDICARE For All should cover prescription drugs, vision care, dental care and mental health care.","The federal government should support our cities, which are the social and economic hubs of our society. We need close cooperation between federal, state, and local governments to coordinate our planning and investment to maintain healthy cities. For Baltimore as an example, the federal government should assist with funding improved infrastructure, especially rapid transit and improvements to the port of Baltimore. Federal assistance and oversight for law enforcement should be provided as agreed to in the consent decree with the Department of Justice. Additional federal support to education and job training should be provided to ensure a trained workforce. This kind of assistance to the City of Baltimore will benefit the entire region.","Substance abuse should be addressed as a medical problem, not a crime problem. We need to provide the medical treatment needed to address this epidemic. Substance abuse requires medical treatment, whether for opioids, methamphetamine, cocaine, crack or alcohol. Treatment needs to be readily available, at the time of crisis, so patients can enter treatment when they are ready to accept the change that is needed. Substance abuse treatment should be provided by medical insurance. Given the high mortality rate of opioid use, we need to take immediate steps at harm reduction. The first task is to keep patients alive. I support the wide availability of NARCAN and similar live-saving medications. To set an example, I have been trained on the use of NARCAN. Most police forces and rescue squads now have that medication on hand, and those programs should be federally supported. Opioid use often begins with use of prescription pain medication. The solution should not be to require patients to stay in pain. Doctors have a responsibility to treat pain and the complications that arise from that treatment, including addiction. Doctors must step patients down from pain medication to retrain the brain to function without the opioids. I have learned that while substance abuse treatment has a high recidivism rate, the key to success is to keep trying. While a treatment program may only be 20% effective, if a patient goes into rehabilitation five times, success is achievable.","We need comprehensive immigration reform. The current laws, which focus on the employer, are not being enforced. Building a 30 foot transparent wall across our southern border is absurd. Most undocumented residents enter on a legal visa, but overstay their visa. No wall will prevent that. Comprehensive immigration reform should increase legal immigration, to reduce the pressure for illegal immigration. We should support family reunification,and not discriminate based on nationality of origin. America is a country built on immigration. Our country was founded by refugees fleeing religious persecution. When ISIS is cutting off the heads of those who disagree with their religious views, we should open our doors to those refugees. Any Muslim ban is unconstitutional. I support a path to citizenship for DACA recipients. These persons who were brought here as children did nothing wrong and should not be punished. I support extending Temporary Protected Status for those who are here, as their homelands remain unsafe. I support ending the 287g program, which is discriminatory. I am the only candidate in this race who has publicly debated Frederick County Sheriff Chuck Jenkins on his use of the 287g program. Enforcement of the existing immigration laws should include enforcement on the employers, not just actions against the immigrants. Current enforcement of the law has been focused primarily on Hispanic immigrants, without enforcement on European immigrants or the U.S. citizens who break the law by hiring undocumented workers. This enforcement pattern is discriminatory and must be stopped.","I support Fair Trade, not trade wars. We need trade which provides jobs to sell goods and services for export. But we need a level playing field. Our trade agreements should require that trading partners provide their workers a decent living and do not damage the world environment. If a nation, like China, is violating trade agreements by manipulating currencies, stealing intellectual property, or dumping steel on the world market; we should use the World Trade Organization to impose an international response, not attempt to impose punishment by ourselves. A global response will be effective in changing behavior, while unilateral tariffs will simply result in China selling to everyone else instead of us, with the U.S. losing our share of the export market. I opposed the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), but we need a replacement to promote trade with Asia on a fair basis.","Yes. Iran has stopped research on nuclear weapons as a result of this deal. They have turned over 98% of their uranium and cannot enrich the remaining uranium above 3.67% so it cannot be used for a bomb. They have removed 2/3 of their centrifuges, so they have limited capacity to enrich nuclear material. They length of time it would take for them to create a nuclear bomb, should they restart a nuclear program, has moved from a few months to over a year. The IAEA has inspectors on the ground in Iran to make sure they do not cheat. The world is safer now than it was before these things were done. We were only able to make this progress because we had international support for sanctions on Iran. If we attempt to pull out of the deal and re-impose sanctions, none of our partner nations will join us, so sanctions will not make any difference. Restoring sanctions could also provide Iran with justification to restart their nuclear program, which would increase risk to the region.","NO PRE-EMPTIVE WAR WITH NORTH KOREA! We need a diplomatic response to North Korea's nuclear program, focused on international economic sanctions. As a trained Korea specialist I know that war with North Korea would be catastrophic. North Korea's nuclear program does not change the strategic situation. North Korea has, for decades, had enough conventional artillery to destroy Seoul, which would cause millions of deaths, including over 100,000 U.S. citizens. They have not used their conventional artillery to attack because they know that would result in the destruction of their regime. They will not use nuclear weapons for the same reason. We should use diplomacy, including economic sanctions, to convince North Korea to abandon their efforts to develop nuclear weapons.",How do you assess the Trump administration so far?,Do you support or oppose the federal tax cuts passed in 2017?

I believe we need to put money in the pockets of hard working American citizens. I believe that this will boost our economy.,"I do believe the national debt is and always will be a concern but until we fix our county, state and federal offices and the careless spending of tax dollars we will not be able to decrease our deficit. We need to have new legislators in office and enforce term limits on all offices held to ensure proper government leadership.

I believe that military grade weapons should not be sold to those without military or specialized training. The average consumer should not be able to purchase any firearm without proper certified training.,I believe that the Affordable care act needs to be repealed and our healthcare system rewritten.

Health Policy and Management,Physician,"The President has been very successful in restoring the American economy through a combination of tax cuts and scaling back unnecessary regulation that was stifling economic growth. We now have the lowest level of unemployment, and the largest number of Americans employed in decades. The President has also restored American foreign policy dominance - as a country that will spread liberty and freedom throughout the world, making our allies know that we will always have their backs when it comes to struggles against authoritarian regimes and radical terrorism. The President has restored the rule of law to our immigration policy - while offering to support a statutory continuation of President Obama's DACA policy.",I support the tax cuts and believe they will help restore the economy and bring millions of jobs back into the United States by lowering the taxes our job creators have to pay from the highest among our competitors in the world to among the lowest.,"Every family and business knows that you have to balance your budget and limit the amount of borrowing that you can do before you become bankrupt. The federal government appears to have no such restraint. The level of federal debt is absolutely a concern - that's why I have voted against spending packages that would increase the debt to unaffordable and irresponsible levels. We have to restrain wasteful government spending, and pass a balanced budget amendment to Constitution that would make the federal government have the same balanced budget requirement that the state of Maryland has.",Every American should have access to equal opportunity - but we can't guarantee equal outcome. WE have to supply the tools that would allow every American to succeed - starting with a world-class education and job training.,"We have to enforce the laws we currently have. Strict gun laws like we already have here in Maryland have done little to stem the tide of gun violence, especially in Baltimore City. There is no reason to believe that extending those laws nationwide would have any better result. It is a shame that in Baltimore City crimes committed with handguns are so poorly enforced. If necessary, we should bring in federal prosecutors to help in prosecution of those cases whenever necessary.","The Affordable Care Act has expanded coverage, but at the cost of making insurance unaffordable for hundreds of thousands of Marylanders on the individual exchange. To lower the cost, I supported the re-establishment of high-risk pooling mechanisms, which would lower the cost for all Marylanders on the exchange. The Maryland legislature took a similar approach this year by establishing a re-insurance mechanism which may accomplish a similar reduction in cost. We should also establish a work or work training requirement for any able-bodied person who is not disable and who does not have young children if they are receiving insurance under the Medicaid expansion.",We should help in reducing violent crime by helping with prosecutions and investigations of gun crimes whenever possible. We should not accept Baltimore being designated one of themost dangerous cities in America.,"The federal government has to partner with state and local governments, as well as communities, to be sure that they have the tools to deal with addiction treatment. The federal government should also make sure that the prescription drug monitoring systems (PDMPs), on which health care providers depend to see if a patient is abusing prescription drugs, works across state lines, and is easy to use for prescribers. Finally, we have to close our borders to narcotic drug trafficking, especially for heroin and fentanyl and its derivatives - which are killing thousands of our children.","We should enforce current immigration law, and expand enforceable temporary work visas for industries like seafood processing, vegetable canning, and tourism which are so important to the economy of the First District.","We have to help our domestic industries from unfair, predatory trade practices of some of our trading partners. For instance, the dumping of low cost Chinese steel and aluminum in America have decimated those industries - industries which use to be an important part of the Maryland economy. Right now, for instance, China refuses to allow the import of American poultry, This is harmful to the economy of the First District - not only to our poultry growers, but also to our farmers who grow the corn and soybeans as poultry feed.","No - it is unenforceable. Two major flaws in the deal are that it is time-limited, and that it doesn't allow inspection on military bases where it was well-known that nuclear research and development were taking place. These two deficiencies have to be corrected.","We have to make it clear to North Korea that we will not tolerate a nuclear threat on the Korean peninsula, and that we will always stand by our allies in the region - specifically South Korea and Japan. To that end, we have to position advanced defensive weaponry in the area that could prevent a nuclear missile or conventional missile launched from North Korea from hitting our allies, or even the continental US. We should pursue a diplomatic solution through bilateral talks with North Korea if necessary - but always with the endpoint of a nuclear-free peninsula.",How do you assess the Trump administration so far?,Do you support or oppose the federal tax cuts passed in 2017?

I then obtained my medical degree from SUNY Downstate in 2005 and completed my pediatric training at NYU/Bellevue Hospital in New York City from 2005-2008.","In 2008, I began my medical career working in the emergency room as an ER Pediatrician at Children's National Medical Center in Washington, D.C. I worked with families of all backgrounds and with the full spectrum of concerns. I also managed a medical practice that my husband and I co-own together. In that capacity, I've been a small business owner as well as been privy to the business side of medicine. I've been up against insurance companies to advocate for patients on the phone. I want to bring that professional experience to the national conversation around health care. Additionally, I am a novelist and public speaker. I have published three internationally bestselling adult novels and two educator-acclaimed children's novels. These stories explore real-life policy issues such as women's rights, immigration, drug addiction, and foreign policy through storytelling. I am a public speaker on these same topics, leading conversations in living rooms, libraries, and classrooms across the United States and around the world.","The Trump administration has been one of chaos, as the late night talk show hosts have stated. I do not appreciate his cuts to the State Department or his posturing to start a nuclear war with North Korea. His administration has lacked clarity of mission, sometimes announcing job transitions over social media. His position on gun violence and, more specifically, his idea to arm each qualified teachers speaks to his inability to understand schools are not meant to be war zones. Trump continues to taunt celebrities, staff members and the media. I believe he's chosen poorly in nominating Betsy DeVos, a woman who does not seem to believe in public schools, for Secretary of Education. Trump's leadership is divisive. When it was time to speak up against the racist demonstrations in Charlottesville, Trump actually tried to garner sympathy for bigots. His rhetoric around immigrants is toxic and it is becoming more apparent that we should be concerned about his relationship to or awareness of Russia's interference in the election. Trump has had a positive impact as well. Never before have we seen such waves of determined, non-political individuals stepping up to be involved in the decision making process. He has forced a wave of support for science, women's rights and the environment. It is hard to stomach saying, but I believe we do have Donald Trump to thank for this swarm of new energy and insistence on leading the way forward.","The tax cuts passed in 2017 will greatly benefits the wealthy and major corporations, while doing little to help the average American they were ostensibly going to aid. It lowered the individual tax rate, repealed the estate tax and lowered the rate on pass through entities. Any short-term gains for the economy will come at the cost of increased debt for our country. It is looking increasingly unlikely that the tax plan will ""pay for itself"" as Republicans purported, and will hurt the long-term economy for years to come. These tax cuts will only further widen the economic gap and grow the power of corporations. Doing away with the personal exemption as well as state and local deductions would hurt families. The Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center found that by 2027, a quarter of all households would pay more in taxes. At a time when middle class families are already feeling the crunch because they are facing steep out of pocket medical bills and crippling student loans with punitive interest rates. Multiple nonpartisan organizations released studies demonstrating that the Trump tax plan would grow our national deficit and that toxic growth would threaten the entitlement programs that Americans need, deserve and have counted on. While some argue that these tax cuts will bring about economic growth that will allow us to recoup our losses, I disagree. We cannot pay for what we need with optimism dollars and must repeal the tax plan.","Yes, the national debt is a concern . To address it, we must be smarter about how we spend our dollars and reorganize our priorities. With Trump's 2017 Tax Cuts inevitably increasing the debt, we need to look at implementing measures like Pay-As-You-Go budget rules in certain circumstances. The Bush-era tax cuts from 2001 and 2003, which were also skewed towards the wealthiest Americans, contributed trillions to the nation debt. My greatest concern is that once debt rises we will attempt to control it by cutting critical programs that help American families like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid to offset the massive tax cuts given to the wealthiest Americans. Since the financial burdens on the middle class are already great, it is cruel to ignore the impact that a strained national budget will have on the people who have been paying into systems with the promise that there hard-earned dollars will come back to them. We need to be smart about our spending. I insist there is room for savings in our defense spending and that we will save money by investing in meaningful preventative care. We can also save a pretty penny by sparing ourselves the embarrassment of a transparent wall on our southern border.","The wealthiest 1% own more than 85 % of all the nation's wealth. On the other end of the spectrum, 80% of all Americans own less than 7% of all the nation's wealth. I look at what has worked to change economic status for rising Americans. My immigrant parents, through entrepreneurship, they were able to become homeowners. Entrepreneurship can also positively transform the lives of women, minorities, and communities. We can also reduce asset poverty by increasing pathways to affordable homeownership. Plighted communities would benefit greatly with down-payment assistance. As a pediatrician, I'm always focused on preventative measures and addressing the needs of children. We must expand cradle to career preparation across the public education systems by means of vocational programs, leveling the quality of our public schools, addressing unbearable student loan interest rates, allowing refinancing of student loans, making universal pre-K accessible to all. We should advance programs like the Federal Job Guarantee and create a workforce that will simultaneously decrease economic inequality and fill much needed roles in our communities ranging from home care to construction. I would block an employer's ability to ask prior wage history as part of recruitment and hiring as it can perpetuate wage discrimination. Furthermore, I will push for meaningful criminal justice reform. The financial burden of interaction with the criminal justice system chokes the potential for real rehabilitation. From bail burdens for non-violent crimes to exclusion from job opportunities, the criminal justice system can trap individuals and their families into perpetual poverty.","As a pediatrician and a mother of four, I insist we reform our federal gun laws. Having worked in an emergency room, I know all too well that gun violence is a serious public safety issue. My husband provides neuro-trauma care to victims of gun violence. His patients have been victims of domestic violence, individuals afflicted with depression and crime victims. My elementary school children have been using words like ""shelter in place"" and ""lockdown."" I will work to close loopholes that currently allow individuals to obtain guns without meaningful and universal background checks. We should enforce waiting periods and ""cooling off"" laws to keep guns from falling into the wrong hands and safeguard against compulsive acts of violence like suicide and intimate partner violence. Since suicide accounts for two of three gun deaths, these laws can save lives. Let's raise the age limit to purchase a firearm to 21. As a pediatrician, I understand that the brain is not fully developed until the mid to late twenties. We cannot expect a young adult, whose brain has almost another decade to fully develop, to make rational decisions. ""Mental illness"" has been used as a scapegoat for our gun violence problem. While we very much need to expand access to mental health services, it is nearly impossible to predict who will use a gun in an illegal way. Finally, we need to fund gun violence research at the NIH and CDC and insist on using science to advance safety.","Those calling for the repeal of the Affordable Care Act have not offered anything to replace it which is a recipe for disaster. The ACA scored several wins in expanding access and ending discrimination but it has empowered the insurance industry and supports big business in health care. We cannot allow medical care to be dominated by corporate interests. We must move toward a single payer health care system. The need for health care is universal and currently medical debt is the top cause of bankruptcy in the United States. My plan for health care reform includes 3 main components as a quick and seamless transition to Medicare for All: Medicare as a public option; reducing the eligibility age to 55 years old; and providing Medicare for all children. Medicare is efficient and direct. But it's not enough to expand coverage. We need to make it affordable and sustainable and we do so by insisting on: Electronic Medical Record interaction, drug patent reform, hospital pricing transparency, a ban on direct-to-consumer pharmaceutical advertising, expanding the use of health savings accounts (HSAs), enabling Medicare to negotiate drug prices, capping annual out-of-pocket medication expenses, protecting funding for the NIH, mandating advance directives, and blocking toxic corporate mergers. We also need to make long term care and assisted living in integrated part of our health care program and push for innovative solutions to the responsibilities that come with an aging population.","Baltimore is a storied city that is fully capable of seeing a new wave of positive growth and development. Its current situation is not unlike many cities across the country where the effects of poverty and lack of resources have far reaching consequences. The federal government can help by promoting policies that promote, not hurt, trade. The federal government can also help by expanding job training programs to meet the needs of booming STEM fields and industries that are modernizing our economy. Congress can also address some of the issues specific to cities like Baltimore by providing grants for programs that address affordable housing needs, enterprise zones and supporting re-entry programs. Much of this can be done by allocating financial resources and partnering with community organizations that have strong roots in the community and a track record for having a positive impact. A city like Baltimore that would greatly benefit from universal pre-K and the allocation of additional funding to public school systems. While the public school systems are fall under the purview of the states, the federal government's investment in schools that are in need of assistance would demonstrate a commitment to giving all children a more level playing field. The ability to increase teachers salaries will boost the quality of education as well. Maryland's congressional representation must also work to bring funding that would support infrastructure rehabilitation and modernization to support the business community of Baltimore.","As a pediatrician, I have cared for jittery and fragile newborns born with Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome. I have seen parents struggle with addiction and rise above challenges. I have also seen the medical community be steered down a path of overtreatment of pain with pills. We need to address this crisis more directly than our current Congress is willing to do. My plan to fight the opioid crisis includes expanding access to outpatient providers and telemedicine providers to fill in gaps, negotiate prices on narcan and buprenorphine, and provide support services to navigate the ER to outpatient therapy connection. Policies that ensure access to long term Medication-Assisted Treatment (MAT) has been a cost-effective path to recovery success stories. We must think beyond short term inpatient rehab stays. As a member of Congress, I will partner with the medical community to increase medical education around the treatment of pain and recognizing addiction. We must explore alternatives to opioid use. I will also expand coordinated MAT programs with the criminal justice system to address the real problem of withdrawal and overdose on release. I will also support the expansion of mental health resources so that we treat the root causes of the opioid epidemic.","Our country is defined by its people, not our borders. My parents came to the country with next to nothing in their pockets but an unwavering belief in the American Dream. They were given opportunities and they made good on them, becoming job creators and uplifting the people around them. My husband fled a war-ravaged Afghanistan as a teen and lived in Europe as a refugee before being accepted to the United States. The welcoming American education system enabled him to become a neurosurgeon. There is no other country in the world that would have given him such a generous opportunity. I believe in the value of immigration because it is my family's story. We need to pass a Clean Dream Act with comprehensive immigration reform. I support preserving provisional protection – a reprieve from deportation and a work permit for undocumented immigrants who entered the country as children (DACA program), protecting family unity, and creating a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Undocumented individuals should still have pathways to report crime without fearing consequences. Watching the GOP use Dreamers as political pawns is shameful. As a member of Congress, I would work to pass legislation to give Dreamers a pathway to remain in the only country they have ever known. I intend to create a positive framework to talk about immigration -- one that positively highlights immigration as America's origin story.","I would encourage free and fair trade with nations that maintain workplace standards comparable to the United States. I would also insist that corporations pay the same taxes on offshore profits as they pay on domestic profits. We must not incentivize American companies to leave American soil. I would like to see NAFTA include updated labor and environmental provisions that require countries to meet minimum international standards. Though it is unclear whether those requirements are enforced, I believe making them priority is a first step towards progress. Punitive tariffs have the appeal of a quick fix but seem to impact household budgets more than they impact national economies or trade cultures. We are a nation of consumers and tariffs will have an impact on prices paid by Americans. In addition, reciprocation of tariffs will negatively affect American exporting industries. President Trump's threatening of tariffs on China appears to have been grandstanding as his tone has cooled. Bluster is not the way to negotiate. I would, however, support provisions and international agreements to protect American intellectual property.","The JCPOA, also known as the Iran Deal, was a rare win-win-win deal for the US, Iran, and the international community. By giving up elements of their nuclear program in return for the lifting of nuclear-related sanctions, Iran received a boost to its economy while the international community reduced the risk of nuclear proliferation, particularly decreasing the potential for a regional nuclear arms race in the Middle East. The JCPOA also served to empower moderates in both the US and Iran who believe the path to Iranian prosperity is by acting as a responsible actor in the community of nations. As a member of Congress, I would oppose efforts to undermine the JCPOA. Some politicians who opposed the JCPOA to begin with are now seeking to undermine the deal through bad faith arguments. As long as Iran continues to meet its obligations under the JCPOA, as the Director-General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has confirmed, I will continue to oppose all efforts to undermine the deal legislatively and otherwise. This includes opposing Trump's de-certification of the JCPOA and any efforts to re-impose the sanctions that were lifted as a result of the JCPOA agreement.","First and foremost, I will always advocate for global nuclear disarmament. There is no real need to maintain the technology that could destroy our world. A nuclear North Korea is a global threat and therefore multilateral diplomacy will be the best path to consider all nations in solving this predicament. We need to work closely with our allies in the region in diffusing the situation. That being said, any efforts or communications on a simply bilateral track will still likely be beneficial for all. It is agreed on that denuclearizing North Korea is in the best interest of all and the sooner we can stop development and hopefully remove nuclear material, the better. North Korea has used the testing of weaponry and unconfirmed reports of nuclear capability to raise the global tensions to the point we are at now, dangerously close to conflict. Reckless and ill-advised tweets will do nothing but worsen an already unpredictable situation. In a related note, I would support restoring full funding for the State Department. The Trump administration's budget cuts have undermined what is one of our most powerful assets in fostering and maintaining positive international relationships.

From weakening our health care system to raising taxes on millions of hardworking families and exploding our future debt, President Trump has failed Marylanders and our nation. He has failed to work with Congress to put the interests of the American people first. President Trump has refused to work toward a compromise on a number of issues of importance to Marylanders, including protections for DREAMers, funding the federal government, responding to gun violence, and working to provide affordable health care.","I strongly opposed the Republican tax law, which raises taxes on hundreds of thousands of hardworking families in Maryland and adds $1.8 trillion to the deficit over the next ten years. Instead of providing relief to middle class families, the Republican legislation hurts Marylanders. The law double taxes many middle class families in Maryland by limiting the state and local tax deduction, which makes it more difficult for local jurisdictions to raise revenues to pay for services and increases the cost of homeownership. Congress ought to put working families first, not pass massive tax cuts for corporations and the wealthy.","Deficits and debt are a serious long term problem that will require tough choices in the years ahead. As we work to invest in job creation, we must work to put our country back on a sustainable fiscal path. Unfortunately, the Trump Administration and Republicans in Congress have made our debt problem much worse through their tax law that added trillions to our national debt. I am committed to reducing the deficit in a responsible way, and believe we must pay for what we buy. That is the principal behind Pay-As-You-Go budgeting that produced budget surpluses in the 1990s and I helped write into law in 2010. Both parties must work together to strengthen vital programs like Social Security and Medicare; support job creation; and protect the middle class, seniors and the most vulnerable. To restore our country's fiscal sustainability, we must adopt a balanced approach that includes both responsible spending cuts and revenues.","Many families in Maryland struggle to make ends meet, and feel left behind. Congress must do more to develop policies that ensure more families in our country are economically secure. We must consider legislation to raise the federal minimum wage, work on breaking down barriers to education, address the rising cost of higher education, and ensure more Americans have access to affordable housing.","When students feel unsafe in their classrooms, restaurant patrons feel threatened, and concerts are no longer safe, it is time for Congress to take action to address gun violence in our nation. For too long, we have seen the devastation this epidemic has caused in our communities, including the recent shooting at Great Mills High School in St. Mary's County, which I represent. Even though a majority of the American people supports commonsense solutions to address the gun violence epidemic, Republican leaders refuse to act. I will continue to urge my Republican colleagues to bring to the Floor legislation to strengthen background checks, close the gun show loophole, ban bump stocks, and ban the sale of assault rifles like those used by soldiers on the battlefield.","Congress should work to strengthen the Affordable Care Act. Thanks to the ACA, thousands of families in Maryland have access to quality, affordable health care. The number of uninsured Marylanders has hit a record low. And despite attempts by President Trump and Congressional Republicans to undermine the law, including cutting the enrollment period in half, over 150,000 Marylanders signed up for health insurance during the 2018 open enrollment period. However, there are aspects of the law that Congress should work to improve, such as bringing down health care costs for consumers. Instead of taking steps to sabotage the law, Republicans in Congress ought to work with Democrats on common sense solutions to strengthen the law, such as investing in outreach and enrollment efforts. I would urge my Republican colleagues in Congress to stop their continued attacks on the ACA. Instead of undermining consumer protections, imposing an age tax on older Americans', destabilizing insurance markets, and driving up costs for individuals, the Trump Administration and Republicans in Congress should work with Democrats to strengthen the law.","In order to strengthen cities like Baltimore and rural communities like those throughout the Fifth District, we need to invest in a 21st century infrastructure plan that will create jobs and strengthen our nation's competitiveness. Such a plan needs to address the crumbling roads, bridges, airports, ports, and rail and transit networks in Maryland and around the country. The recent shutdown of the Baltimore Metro system demonstrates that we cannot wait to invest in our infrastructure. It's clear the President's infrastructure plan is not a serious approach to building the infrastructure we need to have a strong economy. Maryland and local governments don't have the kind of available capital that the Trump Administration's plan demands they spend without federal assistance. Republicans and Democrats in Congress must work together on a real infrastructure plan that invests in our communities.","The ongoing opioid crisis is a serious problem in communities throughout Maryland, and around the nation. Congress must examine different ways the federal government can provide support to local jurisdictions battling the epidemic. I'm glad that legislation to fund the government for fiscal year 2018 included funds to address the opioid epidemic. The federal government must work in tandem with communities throughout the country to educate the public and prevent drug use while also providing treatment to those battling an addiction.","Eighty-six percent of Americans across the political spectrum believe it is wrong to deport individuals protected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program to countries they do not know. When President Trump ended the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program in September 2017, he left hundreds of thousands of hardworking young people twisting in the wind. I believe that we must take action and pass bipartisan legislation to protect the thousands of DREAMers who call Maryland home. Congress must pass legislation to restore DACA protections and provide a pathway to citizenship.","With 96% of the world's customers living outside the United States, we have a clear interest in tearing down tariffs and other barriers to American exports. Our highly educated workforce, efficient and stable capital markets, strong intellectual property protections, and low energy costs mean that it is a great time to make it in America. So long as we are competing on a level playing field, we can compete with anyone in the world and win, so it is in our interest to open foreign markets to trade. At the same time, we cannot turn a blind eye to those who don't play by the rules and use unfair trade practices to distort markets, undercut prices or steal our intellectual property. There is no question that China -- and other countries -- have engaged in these practices, hurting U.S. companies that play by the rules. We need to take strong, smart and effective actions to prevent these countries' actions from putting our companies out of business and costing our workers their jobs. Unfortunately, the Trump Administration's actions have been ham-handed and haphazard - with no coherent strategy or consideration of likely costs. As a result, while they may give the appearance of strength in the short term, they risk doing more harm than good to our economy in the long term.","I supported the Iran deal not because it was perfect, but because, if adhered to, it would have at least temporarily reduced the threat of a nuclear-armed Iran. I believe negotiating to extend the life of the agreement and include non-nuclear aggressive behavior of Iran is appropriate. Iran remains an existential threat to Israel and our other allies, and it continues to support terrorism around the world. Its ballistic missile tests; murderous support for Assad; and continued sustenance of Hezbollah, indicate that it is not changing its behavior post Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). I strongly support preventing Iran from gaining a permanent foothold in Syria, and I believe we must do everything possible to ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself against any threats.",Ballistic missile and nuclear tests by North Korea are immediate threats and demand an international response that goes beyond words of condemnation. China must work with the international community to isolate the Kim regime and make clear that nobody will sit idly by and tolerate such actions that threaten the peace and stability of the region and the global community.,How do you assess the Trump administration so far?,Do you support or oppose the federal tax cuts passed in 2017?

This candidate asserts that the fictitious head of the United States of America Donald Trump and his corporate Board of Directors those members of the U.S. House and Senate also private corporate officers are diminishing the integrity of the United States both at home and around the world creating a level of uncertainty by placing cabinet officers in positions where they benefit the cabinet officers personal beliefs over the welfare of the United States and its citizens. The CEO and his cabinet are clearly elitist caring only for the top 15% of corporate entities and the 2% of the wealthiest in the world of the best interest of our nation as a whole. I feared the long-term effects on the survivability of this great nation and its people based on the disrespect the CEO and his cabinet members disrespect for the founding fathers intent and purpose.","Of course as a candidate I object to the recent tax cuts per past year as they appear to only support the 2% of wealthy corporations for placing the president in office and donating almost in the legend $1,000,000,000 to his 2016 campaign. For the office . I disagree that poster's claims by the administration this tax act will strengthen United States of America myself and numerous educators in tax matters disagree. The tax act does nothing to prevent waste fraud and abuse by corporate wrongdoers municipal corporations and state corporate officers failing to provide honest services to the citizens and inhabitants of this great nation. Many economists see severe cuts in our healthcare systems, environmental and educational institutions. Transportation and infrastructure research and development by the CDC and DHHS funding to be detrimental to the long-term prosperity of this nation.tax The TAX reform act also through its rush to approval covered many pork-barrel projects and special interest projects detrimental to the financial survi-ability of our economy while at the same time cutting deep into social programsand safety nets to our seniors and war veterans who are being deceased of the property in their legal rights by government corporations abusing the rule of law and their oath of office to provide honest services to all citizens of this nation not give preference to the top 2% of the wealthiest and 15% of corporate officers and agents servicing that 2% as fellow corporate insiders fleecing our economy.

Of course this is mainly due to the fact that corporate officers of the United States Inc. and its affiliates corporate officers in the states governments, Department of Justice and states Attorney's offices have conveniently looked the other way as corporate international bankers and national bankers have been allowed to steal over 77,000,000 homes and businesses from our fellow Americans. With forge documents yet not one corporate officer or the judges involved have been held accountable for this travesty of injustice. This candidate has been fighting for accountability and fighting against waste fraud and abuse in our judicial and legislative state and federal offices of 28 years 1st is a victim himself now as of victims rights advocate. His efforts can be chronicled @ secretjustice.com and @ georgemcdermott.com over 1150 programs available for public view.

Title 8 USC 1481 stated once an oath of office is taken citizenship is relinquished, thus you become a foreign entity, agency, or state. That means every public office is a foreign state, these above acts by previous congresses which 99% of Americans are not aware of have separated our country into the haves and have-nots. Those corporate agents of the new United States Inc. who are no longer citizens of these United States of America believe they have some sort of judicial and sovereign immunity making their actions and in-actions immune from prosecution and persecution from the rest of the general public and society. Basically if you do not belong to 1 of these corporations you are a slave of these corporations no longer protected by the organic Constitution of the United States or the Bill of Rights. Yet as taxpayers we the general population have to pay for the wrongdoing of these corporate agents subverting our Constitution.it's our duty as citizens to hold the court officers and corporate agents responsible for the criminal misconduct","This candidate's position is definitely yes. once again our organic Constitution granted our citizens right to bear arms as at the time of adoption this new Republic was without fully staffed armies to protect our citizens whose restaurant and southern movements in the hostile territories meant that many families needed to form militias to protect their friends and neighbors from subversives and the Native Americans corporate America wanted to take their land for their own. Our Second Amendment to the organic Constitution may still be in as corporate America did not abolish this right as far as this candidate can discern. SEE Title 22 USC (Foreign Relations and Intercourse) Chapter 11 identifies all public officials as foreign agents. Title 28 USC 3002 Section 15A states that the United States is a Federal Corporation and not a Government, including the Judiciary Procedural Section.

However this candidate believes that the Second Amendment was never intended by our founding fathers to allow for weapons of the 21st century used by militaries around the world to be purchased and used by common citizens especially without proper checks and balances to prevent the mass killings of our citizens with these militarized weapons which are sold without background checks, without licensing and are now being used indiscriminately kill masses of children attending schools churches and places of assembly. We need to band the NRA and its members buying the influence of our legislative/judicial leaders.","1st and foremost the Congress should act in the best interest of the citizens of these United States and not the lobbyists and corporate special interest groups supporting private interest for-profit corporations fleecing our American citizens and our healthcare systems of trillions of dollars, on one hand you have corporate lawyers lobbying Congress paying for political campaigns for private for-profit corporations special legislation and bills/resolutions.

And yet you have A- 3rd group of for-profit legal corporations acting as states attorneys offices US attorneys offices FBI agents and Justice Department personnel turning a blind eye to the acts of their fellow bar members in many cases fearing to upset the apple cart by prosecuting the subversive acts against our Constitution. This candidate being 73 years old has great concerns about the future of our healthcare and social system in this nation if our Justice Department would crackdown on the waste fraud and abuse in the flagrant overcharging of pharmaceutical suppliers and distributors the current system could be made to work yet this administration is expending huge amounts of resources to make sure that the classes of citizens who fall through the cracks are deceased of their access to proper healthcare which will only add to the financial distress of this nation all we can do is pray that, heads will prevail .","The city of Baltimore as well as the state of Maryland both as private for-profit corporations are being decimated white-collar criminals and Maryland's Mafia control courts are both the Maryland Atty.

Pakistan, India, North Korea, China, Israel, are but a few of the nations possessing their own nuclear weapons. recent statistics show latest statistics show that emphasis supplied. ("" the United States and Russia still maintain the world's largest stockpiles of nuclear weapons, holding 92% of the world's estimated 15,000 nuclear warheads. While today's arsenals seem quite excessive, ..."") Yes it is excessive but as a child of the fifties I still see images of the 1st 2 atomic bombs devastation. The destruction of the world will not come from a nation possessing one learn more devices for its defense. it will come from one or more of the superpowers 15,000+ nuclear devices getting into the hands of extremist. It is time the world stop saber rattling as everyone knows and logic dictates and as Pres. Kennedy stated we now hold in our hands the power to abolish all life on this planet. With the benefit of our children and grandchildren and their children and grandchildren responsible legislative leaders and governments have a duty to their citizenry to work together as joint inhabitants on this earth. to act in humanitarian manner and the established international human rights laws to preserve this planet for future generations. Something our leadership has forgotten about","My personal views as a candidate is that the current policies of the last 50 years plus when the US failed to address the problem in North Korea. It has now come full circle 50 years of isolationism, economic deprivation, and humanitarian crisis has not stopped the development of a nuclear program by North Korea. The events of this year clearly show that rhetoric and threats of rhetoric will not work and have not worked in the past. The leadership of both nations are fully aware that a nuclear war is unwinnable all sovereign nations have the right to protect themselves against aggressors. It's time we stop the saber rattling as it appears to anyone of common sense the North and South delegations are about to meet. My prayers are that they will work to resolve their differences. Without the interference of third-party nations promoting their own agendas and political views of the best interest of all Koreans. These are the personal views of George E McDermott candidate for the United States Congress is Republican 2018 Maryland with congressional district.

,YES,Representative in Congress,6,Aruna Miller,Miller,11/06/1964,Darnestown,Democratic,Montgomery County,http://www.arunamillerforcongress.com,arunamillerforcongress,arunamiller,http://surveygizmoresponseuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/fileuploads/296249/4299807/245-d49f474b440fb393979e0fca9e77b496_Miller_Headshot.jpg,Bachelors in Civil Engineering - University of Missouri - Rolla,I have served as a Maryland State Legislator for 8 years in Annapolis. I also have served over 25 years working as a civil engineer providing transportation solutions to the citizen of Montgomery County.,"Trump has continued the same rhetoric disparaging individuals for their national origin, religion, and ethnicity while in office that he used used on the campaign trail. Instead of elevating discussions and promoting unity among the citizens of our nation his thoughtless language has sewn seeds of divisiveness. His attempts to dismantle critical federal programs not only negatively impacting our country but our planet as he rolls back environmental protection and regulations. Our withdrawal from the Paris Climate Accord is an abdication of leadership in the development of clean energy solutions of the future. At a time when the international arena is facing an amount of diplomatic tension not seen in years, he is attempting to dismantle the state department. These actions are not acceptable, as they threaten the well-being and safety of the very Americans he is sworn to serve.","President Trump's tax cuts are fundamentally unfair and irresponsible. Corporations received a 1.5 trillion dollar tax cut on the backs of American families. These cuts ballooned the deficit with no guarantee of economic growth. Trickle down economics have never worked and there's no evidence to suggest they will here. These cuts are a giveaway to huge Republican donors who don't need them. We should be using the revenue from these taxes to fund ambitious infrastructure projects, fund public education, or fund healthcare programs that help our society at large, not just President Trump's wealthy donors.","Yes national debt should be a concern. The massive tax cut legislation that President Trump and Congressional Republicans recently passed lowers taxes on top earners and explodes our national debt. That is irresponsible. If a country decides to spend more than it brings in, it should be investing in things that will help grow its economy, like infrastructure projects. To constrain the increase of national debt, we have to ensure a solid base of tax revenue, and carefully evaluate our spending. Military spending represents over 50% of discretionary spending (more than the next 8 nations combined). In Congress I will ensure American taxpayer dollars are being spent wisely. I will support strengthening, and more importantly modernizing, our Armed Forces to defend our national security interests. Threats around the world have changed and we must adapt. Cyber warfare, unmanned aerial vehicles and small cell terrorism are some of the biggest challenges we face in the 21st Century, and what was the template for military spending in the 20th century should be reexamined.","The current level of economic inequality in the United States is a problem which must be addressed. I have co-sponsored bills to increase Maryland's minimum wage to $15 dollars an hour and I would support similar legislation at the federal level. We cannot allow workers suffer through years of stagnant wage growth due to the political difficulties encountered each time increasing the minimum wage comes up for the debate. Ideally, the minimum wage could be tied to inflation to remove this obstacle. There are a multitude of additional steps that can be taken, and they include access to quality health care, breaking down barriers to get a college degree or vocational training and ensuring our international trade policies are focused on benefitting American workers not large multinational corporations. In addition, we should increase the Earned Income Tax Credit which would provide more economic support for the working poor. Finally, we need to support workers' rights to unionize. It is not a coincidence that declining union membership in the US has coincided with a declining middle class and a larger wealth inequality.","Yes, federal gun laws should be changed, and I have introduced a 5 point evidence based plan to reduce gun violence. First, we need to repeal the Dickey amendment and appropriate funds into gun violence research by the CDC so we can better tackle the problem. Second, we need to pass universal background check legislation. Background checks keep guns out of the hands of those who should not have them. Third, we need to strengthen the National Instant Criminal Background Check System because laws requiring background checks are only as good as the system that performs those background checks. Fourth, we need to ban military-style assault weapons. We know that such a ban works because we had one from 1994 to 2004. And fifth, we need to raise the minimum age to purchase firearms to 21. Increasing the minimum age to purchase any firearm will help prevent school shootings as well as thousands of suicides.","Nowhere in the U.S. Constitution is it written that the government must provide quality education to our children, but we do it because we know that providing a basic level of education to all citizens is a public good. A healthy population is as important as an educated population, which is why we should be moving toward a single payer system that covers every American. The ACA was a big leap forward on the road towards achieving universal healthcare for all Americans, however we still have a long way to go. We must not only defend the ACA against efforts to repeal it, but expand upon it to further improve access to healthcare for all Americans. Our next step towards achieving universal health care should be to build upon the successes of the ACA and move our country into a single-payer system. The first step in this process would be to introduce a public option into our individual health insurance exchanges. This step is crucial, especially in areas such as Western Maryland where there is only one insurance provider offering plans on the individual market, as it would reintroduce market competition and options to beneficiaries. The next step in this process would be to expand our existing Medicare program, by incrementally lowering the Medicare eligibility age until it encompasses all Americans.","There are several roles the federal government can play in helping cities like Baltimore. By investing in transit, especially in a way that expands service in more economically depressed areas to increase easy accessibility to jobs is one option. In addition, the federal government can help create economically integrated neighborhoods, which integrate low income housing with middle-class housing, through building upon existing HUD programs. We must focus on growing a broad and resilient middle class through education investments and supporting workers rights to unionize.","In the Maryland General Assembly, I have actively fought for legislation and leadership to address our state's opioid epidemic. I have supported bills that are saving lives in Maryland like the Heroin and Opioid Prevention Effort (HOPE) and Treatment Act and the Heroin and Opioid Education and Community Action Act. These bills provide funding for treatment and public education, ensure the availability of naloxone and other overdose-reversing medication for those who need it, and place limits on amount of opioids that can be prescribed. We need to bring some of the legislation we passed in Annapolis to Washington. But in Congress we can go further. Through greater public awareness campaigns we need to destigmatize addiction and educate people how they can get treatment and finally ensure they have access to health care that can provide treatment. Much of the opioid epidemic has grown where income disparities have continued to grow and where the jobs that once provided a solid middle class life have disappeared. Government has failed to address the large scale displacement of workers due to changes in the global economy and technology. The government needs to be investing in infrastructure and education to ensure we are creating 21st century jobs in the United States. In addition, we need to push back on attacks on workers' ability to unionize so we can finally see an increase in real wages and benefits.","I came to this country when I was 7 years old. I did not have a choice. My parents brought me here. America is my home. When I see the treatment of those who are protected under the DACA program, I believe my experience gives me a unique understanding and empathy for their plight. The United States is a country built on immigration, and our strength comes from the conglomeration of ideas and perspectives which immigration has created throughout our nation's history. However, our current immigration system is broken and backlogged. I propose that we lift the arbitrary annual caps on H-1B visas and increase the annual limits on family-sponsored preference visa applications. There is no reason why prospective immigrants should be required to wait over 20 years just to be reunited with their family members. I also believe we need to protect immigrants already within this country, regardless of their status, by providing a pathway to citizenship for these individuals.","In order for our country to remain competitive in the highly competitive global market, the U.S. must enter trade agreements to create markets for American goods. However, whenever we enter such trade agreements, we need to promote fair trade that benefits American workers and ensure that all partners in the agreement protect the environment and workers' rights.","I support the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Now that this deal is in place, we must be steadfast and vigilant in enforcing it. The Iran Nuclear Deal not only establishes a standard for a relationship with a crucial country in the region, it also shows other countries that we can make deals with people other than our steadfast allies. It gives us leverage when negotiating with less-than-friendly countries in the future.",I support initiating bilateral or multilateral negotiations with North Korea with the goal of negotiating a nuclear freeze and eventual disarmament of the Korean Peninsula. The increased weapons capabilities of North Korea is a global security threat to the United States and our Allies in the region. It is of utmost importance that we continue to work with our international partners to apply pressure to the North Korean regime as we closely monitor their actions.,How do you assess the Trump administration so far?,Do you support or oppose the federal tax cuts passed in 2017?

,YES,Representative in Congress,7,John Moser,Moser,07/19/1985,Baltimore,Democratic,Baltimore City,http://www.johnmoserforcongress.com,electjohnmoser/,electjohnmoser,http://surveygizmoresponseuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/fileuploads/296249/4299807/179-df63a9abb86fe4bec6a06486fa807a6b_4dP2OT5g_400x400.jpg,"Eastern Technical High School, 2003 Associate's Degree in Networking Technologies, CCBCMD","IT Administration and IT Security Engineer. Worked at Social Security Administration as an IT Security Analyst, became an IT Security Engineer, moved forward from there. I obtained a Project Management certification and use that knowledge as I can, but have not been able to force a career change.","The President has no executive capacity. He has weakened the United States not simply through his policies, but through his conduct: big businesses and other nations see the President as a joke, someone to be ignored, whose public rhetoric has no real impact. The market staggers around due to uncertainty about his outbursts and bad policies rather than the integrity of American enterprise. The Administration has weakened our social safety nets such as HUD and SNAP, has gutted Obama policies simply because they were Obama policies, and has created situations where children and families are put at risk by policy and then dangled those threats in front of Congress as negotiating leverage, as if they were holding hostages. This has impacted our economy and has impacted good, hard-working families. The President has practically destroyed the USDA. His Administration removed the major function of the USDA dedicated to Rural America support programs, the very people he promised to help. His trade policies will reduce the wealth of working Americans, resulting in less purchasing and, contrary to his talk about helping truckers, reducing the amount of shipping and thus the availability of jobs for truckers. The Trump Administration lacks the professional capacity to handle the job to which it is tasked, and has harmed and will continue to harm our Nation, our Nation's enterprise, and the good hard-working Americans depending on our National policies.","I intend to repeal and replace the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Act created enormous deficit, acted in great haste, complicated tax policy, and has disproportionate impact on states with higher taxes--which, oddly enough for a Republican effort, means the TCJA discourages strong and independent State government and instead seeks State dependence on the Federal government. Worst of all, the TCJA uses Chained-CPI-U to adjust tax brackets after 2016. C-CPI-U rises more-slowly than inflation and wage, and so pushes the poor and middle-class up into higher tax brackets over time. The Administration suggested this will create $500 billion of new revenue over the next 10 years: no increases on the wealthy in the top bracket, and move the less-wealthy up toward that top bracket to raise their taxes. All of this will continue to weaken consumer buying power, first hurting families, then our enterprises, and our States and Local governments who will be deprived of tax revenues by the loss of taxable corporate and personal income.","The National Debt is a great concern. Economists are uncertain what identifies when debt is a concern: it's not as simple as a magic Debt-to-GDP or Debt-per-Capita threshold. We stand at over 100% Debt-to-GDP now, and 60% is considered prudent. The rate of debt growth raises the biggest concern. If we are so dependent on more and more debt, then we will have terrible problems when other Nations suddenly lose confidence in our credit and refuse to lend. A lower Debt-to-GDP may not be a reliable technical indicator of economic health, but it does show responsibility and maintains faith in our credit. It also reduces the interest we pay on that debt, now over $200 billion. Repealing the TCJA and implementing economic policies which have little fiscal impact would place us back on the 2016 deficit level. Strengthening our economy, streamlining operational efficiency, and attempting to increase our debt more-slowly than inflation and GDP growth would allow us to keep borrowing while our Debt-to-GDP ratio shrinks, demonstrating strong control over our fiscal situation and giving us greater fiscal control over our debt and interest.","Economic inequity is an enormous problem. I entered the race for Congress to bring a Universal Dividend to the United States to completely-end homelessness and hunger, after having worked out the fiscals in a manner which would not require a tax increase or service cuts in 2016. This is the ""replace"" part of ""Repeal and Replace the TCJA"". The Universal Dividend essentially solves Social Security's insolvency and guarantees its Retirement and Disability benefits will pay out in full, cost-of-living adjusted, forever. It does this by completely-restructuring Retirement and Disability: a new benefit with a stronger funding source pays unconditionally starting at age 18, and then Retirement and Disability fill the gap to the full total benefit. This new benefit takes 1/8 of all of the income as a FICA on both Corporate and Personal income, and pays out a flat, non-taxable benefit to every Adult twice-monthly. In 2016, this would have been $6,700. That makes people less-poor, increasing the reach of HUD and SNAP, bringing people out of homelessness and hunger. It creates additional consumer spending, which creates jobs; and those jobs appear mostly around the poorest, as they gain the largest proportional increase in income. Because of the structure, the Dividend grows faster than cost-of-living and inflation. I also suggest minimum wage pay one full-time year's wage at no less than twice the Dividend, reaching a total take-home equivalent to $15.11/hr in 2027. That, plus education and healthcare, will change the world.","Yes. We need to make a few minor adjustments to background checks and other things. I believe we must take a much-larger strategy than our current dialogue suggests. Although the greatest impact will come from criminal justice reform to help people move from crime to productivity, there are a number of policies which we must implement concerning firearms. We need accountability by the State and Local governments to ensure information reaches the NICS background check database. We must also restrict magazine size to six at most: revolvers carry six shots, and so this makes sense from an enforcement perspective. We also need to look at bullet dynamics. We're going to let people hunt and keep self-defense weapons; we must thus consider if a bullet can be sufficient to take down the appropriate animal and also have diminished effect against a human being and a crowd of human beings. Powder load and bullet shape have enormous impacts on what happens when you fire a bullet into a crowd. Rifles and handguns should not accept the same bullets. As well, we must test semi-automatic action under accelerated firing. A cheap hunting rifle can physically fire at 400-600 rounds per minute. The action should physically take at least half a second to cycle, unless completely-rebuilt in a non-trivial manner obvious on inspection. The AR-15 ban effort ignores this and will fail to prevent dangerous rapid-firing through trivial modification to readily-available firearms.","Strengthen the ACA and provide a public option to guarantee no American ever goes without access to care for even one moment. Healthcare is not affordable unless the insurance copays and out-of-pocket maximums are also affordable, and the ACA essentially only makes provision for the cost of premiums for low-grade plans. Expand the small business subsidy and pay 50% of the cost of healthcare for these businesses. If the workers have a union, extend the phase-out period for those workers. Figuring out a premium is a little complex: we don't want to reward employers for pushing you to the Public Option. Should a person have no job or be self-employed, they receive the Public Option care matched to their income level at no premium. A person with extremely-large financial assets might be measured by that instead. They may pay an additional differential to buy a higher level of coverage, if they so choose. A person with a job which does not offer healthcare receives the Public Option at no premium: their employer pays the affordable rate as a payroll tax. If the employer supplies care which is NOT affordable, then the person can pay the affordable rate, and the employer can also pay the affordable rate as a payroll tax. If the employer supplies care which IS affordable, then the person pays the usual cost, and the employer pays their usual share as a payroll tax. A great deal more is needed for healthcare.","The Universal Dividend would have driven nearly $2 billion of additional non-taxed income into the hands of Baltimore City residents in 2016. Of course this creates spending, new jobs, taxable wage revenue, taxable business revenue, and the like as well. This policy will drive the phenomena of the poor inner city into the history books in short order, in Flint, in Detroit, and in all such cities with struggling populations. HUD should help people to pay their mortgage the same as it would if they were renting under the same cost conditions. My mortgage for 15 years is under $500/month; a poor family facing $500/month rent gets a voucher, and why would we not give them that same voucher if they have the chance to purchase and own their home at the same monthly price? Federal funding for education and transit projects as well as an enormous push for criminal justice reforms such as increased parole, greater behavioral health services, dynamic security as the required base model for prisons, and other programs which humanize and care for those who interface with corrections and rehabilitate them to lead productive lives will have the greatest impact after ending homelessness and hunger.","Medical marijuana may play a role. Criminal justice reform brings behavioral health services and reduces the conflict between the population and corrections. In short: asking for help escaping addiction should lead directly to help, rather than criminal filings and felony imprisonment. These people desperately want help, and they get five days of Methodone and a year of facing the long-term withdrawal on their own. This isn't the fault of doctors and pharmacists, although we might like to ask about the manufacturers's literature pushing opioids; this is the fault of our nation not stepping in to identify, acknowledge, and correct our mistakes. We have not been there to help these people when addiction comes, and this is the result; these other factors--many of which are important in their own right--are secondary to that great responsibility of government for which we now make only excuses.","Nearly two-thirds of unauthorized immigrants are visa overstays. For complex economic reasons, these have approximately zero impact on the health of our economy and the employment market. In any case where we have no compelling reason otherwise, all student visas should automatically become work visas; and all work visas should automatically renew and grant independence to find new work. Perhaps we should transition work visas to permanent residence (""green card""). Citizenship is a bigger topic. The process is long, fraught with delays, and is in the end a personal decision. Citizenship grants access to Federal welfare programs such as Social Security, as well as voting rights and the right to run for any Federal office other than that of President of the United States. Nevertheless, a lawful immigrant waiting on Citizenship may become an unlawful immigrant in the interim; thus we must focus on permanent, independent residence as an automatic consequence of being resident and in good enough standing to stay. Sanctuary Cities can keep their immigrants. I would prefer they are housed in humane facilities and treated as human beings rather than released simply to avoid turning them over to ICE. For a suspected terrorist, Homeland Security will have to take the guest's chair: the City can claim jurisdiction to hold or parole the suspect indefinitely, rather than turn them over to a DHS facility. They will of course work with DHS in their investigation.","Free trade makes every American wealthier. Policies to protect Americans from sudden shifts in trade and technology are necessary; however, protectionism by way of shutting out trade only creates instability and poverty. Where a sudden shift in technology or trade threatens the American economy, such as by threatening many jobs, the United States must take action to slow this shift. Those whose jobs are lost in the path of progress become the responsibility of our welfare system: we must ensure their economic security and help them transition to new jobs without facing financial ruin. We must, therefor, ensure that so many keep their jobs so as to not exceed our capacity in doing so. In due time, American workers will transition. We moved from Agriculture to Manufacture; and then from Manufacture to Services, Technology, and Healthcare. That transition convinces new entrants to the workforce that these jobs are not going to be there in coming years, and tends to cause a mild labor shortage, protecting jobs as the industry winds down, and allowing it to shrink to fit by the retirement of industry veterans. ""Industries"" are things: they are a great many corporations and the things they do. They are not American enterprise, American jobs, and American standard-of-living; they are the romantic ideal of factories and farms, of computer researchers and medical technicians. People need jobs, economic security, and a high standard-of-living; people don't need a vibrant industry of elevator operators or other such specific ideals.","Yes. It is good for national and global security. It also lifts economic sanctions on Iran. Economic sanctions are a tool by which a nation increases poverty in another nation as some form of punishment or show of power. This mostly harms children and civilian workers by reducing economic stability and support, thus reducing access to food, water, energy, healthcare, and all other basic needs. In short: economic sanctions are a form of violent, devastating attack on an entire population's physical and emotional health, while the powerful retain control over national wealth and so keep themselves and their interests well-funded. The moment I learned what economic sanctions are, I projected this effect, and so classified economic sanctions as war crimes. I have since learned I am not the only person of this opinion.","Difficult. North Korea is a poverty-stricken state thanks in part to economic sanctions and a lack of economic aid. It is an unstable dictatorship as a result, and difficult to approach safely. The ideal approach is, of course, to somehow stabilize North Korea, and then help grow and develop their economy into something by which the people and the government have a vested interest in remaining stable. That leaves the great question of how exactly to make North Korea's leadership identify us as their great friend and economic partner, and so bring them to truly seek to work well with the US and UN and abandon their hostilities entirely. That is someone else's problem: I don't have the capacity to solve that one at this time, and will maintain this stance until such a time as I am for whatever reason fully qualified to address the situation. Domestic matters of economics, technology, and human rights are more of my interest.",How do you assess the Trump administration so far?,Do you support or oppose the federal tax cuts passed in 2017?

Graduated with honors from Suffolk Law School in 1977.,"Recently retired after nearly 25 years as Talbot County Attorney. Prior to that I worked in private practice, in public defense, and as a taxi driver.","This administration is bad for our Country and bad for Democracy. It's poisoning our environment, harming workers, families, women, minorities, immigrants, seniors, students and children. It's undermining education, healthcare, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid. It's undermining faith in our public institutions. It's attacking reporters, the free press and squandering America's credibility and moral standing among other nations and world leaders. It's abandoning allies, befriending those who seek to harm us, and undoing strategic alliances. It has no direction. This administration lacks respect for the rule of law, the Constitution, international law, the United Nations, and the American people. The lack of empathy, knowledge, understanding, or a shared moral vision eliminates the possibility for constructive change. Corruption is rampant, unchecked, and overlooked as if it doesn't matter. Lies, deceit, disloyalty, and dysfunction pervade this administration. The only protection we have in the face of a House without a backbone is this administration's incompetence. America's strength, resilience, and determination to hold this administration to account, to protect our democracy and uphold the rule of law, however, will be made very clear in the 2018 elections.","I oppose the tax law because it takes from American working families and gives to the rich, looting the American Treasury for the benefit of the top 1%. Here's how the plan falls out: out of every $1,000 in tax giveaways, the top 1% get $830. The rest of us get roughly 17¢ each. Even that tiny fraction is subtly gobbled up by the increased costs of medical insurance that Republicans have baked into the law. After 10 years, most middle class workers will be paying more in taxes for less public services. Greed and unfairness won, plain and simple. The top 1% already have more wealth than at any time since the Gilded Age, and certainly did not need a corporate bailout that will explode the deficit by $1,500,000,000 and make our social safety net even harder to fund. The American people were told that this law would ""help working families,"" but helping working families was never the true aim of this bill. Destabilizing our federal budget and rewarding political donors was the aim. Looting the American treasury, stealing from Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid was the aim. Allowing the Republicans to come back to Congress in five or ten years and claim that they must cut benefits because the government is surprisingly underfunded, is the aim. In those regards, the Republicans were right on target.","Yes, the national debt is a serious concern. High debt limits our ability to increase spending in an economic downturn, which increases the risks of a longer, deeper economic crisis. High debt limits our opportunities to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, limiting the creation of good paying jobs rebuilding America. Like a business, a government cannot be run on IOU's alone. To get the debt under control, we must prioritize the funding of essentials, our military, schools, roads, and our healthcare, while seeking ways to expand our tax base to make new projects possible. Where we can cut spending, such as in the bloated and inefficient military budget (the highest in the world by far) we must. We can invest those savings in health, education, and social programs, allowing us to fund early childhood education programs, better health care, tuition-free public education for college, technical training, and skilled trade apprenticeships. We need a progressive tax code that evenly balances the costs and shares the rewards of our economy among all Americans. We must raise the minimum wage, which will increase buying power, place upward pressure on mid-level wages, and increase consumer spending in our economy, generating more tax revenue. At the core of the debt debate is the question of whether we want to burden our children with our spending today. I believe that is the wrong course of action to take, and future generations will resent us if we cannot not get our own reckless spending under control.","Economic inequality is a serious problem. The top 1% own nearly 40% of the wealth, more than the bottom 95% combined. Nearly half of all Americans can't afford a $400 emergency expense without borrowing or selling assets. The middle class is shrinking, while the costs of housing, health-care, child care, education and job training are rising. Young Americans are working two, three, or even four jobs just to keep a roof over their heads. Wages have been mostly stagnant for decades, while corporate profits are at an all time high. American working families need better pay, working conditions, and benefits. They deserve the right to organize for their mutual protection and benefit, while protected by a NLRB that has their interests at heart. They deserve to be able to make a living wage working a single full-time job. They deserve the right to be protected from unscrupulous employers who fail to protect their physical well-being, and who actively practice harassment. We can begin to address these issues today by raising the minimum wage to $15/hour, updating the NRLA for the modern economy, ensuring that today's bad actors are punished, and by extending protections against discrimination by employers for the future. We need a progressive tax system so the wealthy and large corporations pay their fair share. We need to eliminate unfair tax loopholes, the ""carried-interest"" loophole, and reinstate the Estate Tax, the Alternative Minimum Tax, so those with extreme wealth pay their fair share.","Yes, we should re-enact the federal assault weapons ban that worked successfully between 1994-2004. This law reduced random massacres in which semi-automatic weapons were to kill innocent children and other Americans. Nobody is against the 2nd Amendment, it's part of our Constitution. Hunting, sport competitions, collecting, are a big part of our heritage here on the Eastern Shore. They help our economy and are part of the many pastimes we enjoy. But there is a clear distinction between handguns, rifles, and shotguns for sport, competition, or collecting, and weapons designed for a battlefield. Bullets from an assault weapon rip through the body ""like a grenade went off inside,"" bursting arteries and organs from the intense shock wave spreading along their path. They destroy tissue, arteries and organs without even hitting them, like a cigarette boat in a narrow canal. They leave exit wounds the size of oranges, with nothing left to repair. Assault weapons are the weapon of choice for domestic terrorists intent on mass killings, and it is our duty to make it as difficult as possible to carry out these horrendous acts. To do so we should: -Ban the sale of new civilian assault weapons, bump stocks, and high capacity magazines. -Implement a mandatory background check for new firearm purchasers. -Close the ""gun show loophole"" by extending background checks to gun show purchases and limiting out-of-state purchasers. -Institute a minimum age to buy firearms.","We should move to a universal health care model like every other major country on earth. It's less expensive, simpler, and more efficient. The ACA was a good first step as it was originally enacted, but elimination of the Medicare expansion, elimination of the mandate, and the repeated Republican attacks to undermine and sabotage the ACA have hobbled it. America needs to join the rest of the industrialized world and provide universal healthcare to all citizens as a right. Universal healthcare will cost less than we're already paying. Americans pay more for healthcare than any other country in the world, but we don't use more, and our outcomes are less positive. Overall, we, the most powerful nation in the history of the world, is only 11th overall in national overall health. We're not just paying more money, we are paying in avoidable deaths, unnecessary suffering, lost income, and lost productivity. Profits and overhead for insurance companies and the cost of prescription drugs now gobble up 42¢ of every dollar we spend on healthcare. Medicare's overhead, on the other hand, is far lower, costing only 3¢ out of every dollar spent to administer. This plan will also provide patients freedom of choice by allowing doctors to decide treatments instead of insurance companies. A medicare-for-all model lets your doctor and you decide what's best for you, and that is the proposal I will champion as your Representative.","The federal government can provide necessary funding for public transit, neighborhood redevelopment and revitalization, public schools, housing, job-training, and infrastructure. Economic aid to assist the redevelopment of the Tradepoint Atlantic site and others can boost economic opportunities and jobs. Federal grant funding is key to continued health, safety, and well-being of the people of Baltimore and those who work, visit, and shop there. Community policing can help reconnect law enforcement with the citizens they serve. Federal pilot programs, training facilities, and research into best practices can help law enforcement throughout the US, but particularly in our cities and metropolitan areas. like Baltimore. Federal agencies can help by treating drug abuse as a public health problem, not a criminal justice problem. Removing marijuana from a Schedule I classification, the schedule reserved for the most dangerous drugs with no known medical purpose, would reduce criminalization of marijuana use, give patients welcome relief, and lighten the load for police, courts, and detention centers. We must also allow and direct the Centers for Disease Control to study gun violence as a public health issue. In 1996, Congress prohibited this. Since then there's been more than 600,000 gunshot victims in the US. In 2016, the American Medical Association adopted a resolution declaring gun violence a public health crisis. Getting the data, analyzing the cause, and coming up with answers to why people shoot others, or themselves, and what can be done to prevent gun violence, would help America and Baltimore.","Seven Americans die every hour from opioid overdose. Children lose parents, parents lose children, families are broken, and communities are left to struggle with the long term ramifications of this public health crisis. America needs prevention, intervention, and rehabilitation. Congress can help with all three. Congress should enact legislation: -that treats drug addiction as a public health issue, not a criminal justice issue, -to halt the over-prescription of opioids and specifically target opioid mills --For example, over the past 10 years, drug companies shipped 20.8 million prescription painkillers to two pharmacies four blocks apart in a Southern West Virginia town with 2,900 people. Congress curtailed the DEA's authority to work these cases in 2016. Congress can reauthorize the DEA's authority to monitor and intercept suspicious flooding of opioids into communities, -to authorize and fund research into the use of medical marijuana to treat pain, and -to establish best practices and provide funding to educate first responders about coordination and follow-up after treating an addict to improve the hand-off to rehabilitation, increase the number and availability of methadone clinics, and identify, coordinate, and duplicate rehabilitation programs that work. Until we realize that we cannot jail our way out of this public health crisis, I fear our response will continue to not be as effective as necessary to get this problem within control.","We have a duty to support immigrant families in our communities. Our nation was built on the hard work of immigrants from around the world. By trying to prevent further immigration, this Administration fails to realize they are changing the nature of America, not protecting it. Without immigration over the last two centuries America would not have become the nation we are today. Immigration has always been a key to our national growth, and to undermine our potential based on xenophobia or fear is bad policy. We must address DACA in the short term, and the long-term issue of undocumented migration. The DACA crisis has been self-created by the Trump Administration and Congress must honor our promise to these dreamers. Our nation is stronger and better because they are here. They need a path to citizenship. Congress must also create a path to citizenship for the millions of undocumented workers who didn't qualify for DACA. Immigrants and the diversity they bring are a great strength, and they make the US what it is. We are all immigrants. To begin mass arrests and deportations is not only inhumane, it also harms our economy. Instead, we should create a pathway to citizenship to allow these individuals to come out of the shadows and pursue the American dream. From among our immigrants and their children, we'll see the next great inventor, or poet, or entrepreneur, but we'll never know until we welcome them into our civic life with open arms.","I support a trade policy that helps American workers and America's working families. Our trade policies should focus on them and their interests, not international corporations. This means supporting trade policies that foster opportunities to sell American products on the international market and to invite foreign investment in American-made products. This means opposing trade deals that drive down American wages by allowing foreign corporations to sell products manufactured by exploiting workers, paying starvation wages, and suppressing the labor market to keep their prices low. We must defend the intellectual property of our entrepreneurs so that American workers producing innovative goods can be rewarded for the hard work that goes into developing and manufacturing a new product.","I support the Iran nuclear deal. This agreement has broad international support and represents a joint effort to maintain the peace and protect international security. There is no reason to reject this Agreement. The international community, with experts from around the world, agrees that it is being honored by the Iranians. The Trump administration has offered no evidence of any violation. It's unacceptable to simply disavow a working Agreement because a new administration assumes power. The Agreement is working and effectively prevents the Iranians from gaining nuclear weapons. If there's real evidence to show otherwise, we can de-certify the Agreement at that point. Until then, if ever, we should uphold our end of the deal and continue to certify compliance. This agreement has widespread international support, and any withdrawal must be done based on an international consensus, after consultation with our allies, and in conjunction with similar actions by our allies. We should learn from the coordinated international response to the recent assassination attempt in the UK by Russian operatives. In a matter of days, the international community rallied to eject over 150 Russian intelligence operatives, dealing a blow to the Kremlin that will take years to repair. That is how international diplomacy can be used to deter and punish bad actors.","The US should continue to work with the international community to sanction the Kim regime, forcing them into negotiations, and should then rely on international collaboration, as well as our own experts, to fashion a workable agreement. We've already done something similar with Iran and we can do the same with North Korea. Military action against North Korea in the name of eliminating its nuclear weapons program would result in another war with catastrophic loss of live and destruction. The people of South Korea would be hit with millions of artillery shells and our allies in Japan would face a barrage of missiles. We could expect huge American casualties even without the destruction inflicted if North Korea actually used the nuclear weapons it has been developing. The predictable losses, and the risks of any military conflict spiraling out of control, are simply too great to justify military action at this point. Sanctions, however, require Chinese participation to be successful, and the Trump administration's short-sighted trade feud with China threatens our ability to gain their support. Instead, our countries should focus on the issues we can all agree on, that a Korean war would be an unmitigated disaster. A conflict on the Korean Peninsula would send millions of North Korean refugees into China, destabilizing the Chinese labor market and creating a humanitarian disaster in China, a situation the Chinese fear. International cooperation is the only way out of this predicament.",How do you assess the Trump administration so far?,Do you support or oppose the federal tax cuts passed in 2017?

UMBC Accounting","Landlord, Development, Real Estate Brokerage","The tax cuts were a first step towards economic recovery. We are seeing high growth rate and low unemployment. The unemployment rate for black Americans is particularly encouraging. But we need to do even better. It is my hope that we continue to make progress and increase the wealth of all Americans. Until the savings rate is over 15% and person debt is reduced I will not be satisfied. We have pulled out of potential agreements like TPP that would have put downward pressure on American wages. We are renegotiating the terms of trade with China which was long overdue. We are making progress in ending the theft of American intellectual property which accelerated greatly under the last two presidents. As a country we were taken advantage of for so long that many people have just become accustomed to it. It's my hope that the phrase ""america first"" transitions from being a campaign slogan to the mindset we approach our decisions with. I want you to remember to ask one question when analyzing policy proposals. ""How does this policy help myself, my family, my community, and my country"". You may find yourself realizing that most of the time what people talk about in DC has nothing to do with your well being.","The tax cuts were far too limited. We will see some positive growth from the new tax rates, but it will not be enough. American families need much larger tax cuts if they want any chance to retire. At the current savings rate, 80% of the families in our country will not retire, they will work until they die. Tax rates should be reduced dramatically until financial stability is restored to the American family. The question Americans should be asking is ""What are we getting for our tax money"". Subsidizing special interest groups and fighting foreign wars with no benefit to our country is not what I would call value for money.","We shouldn't dance around this issue, the cause of our national debt is our intervention in foreign affairs. The Vietnam War, the Iraq Wars, and our role as policeman of the world is responsible for almost 100% of the national debt. Over 7 trillion wasted in the middle east since 2003. If this reckless policy of foreign intervention benefited Americans it is certainly not showing in our financial statements. Most Americans have less than $10,000 in savings. Unfortunately there is one issue Republicans and Democrats always agree on and that's spending money overseas. We will fight each other to the death over the smaller financial issues but when it comes time to spend another billion overseas, no one blinks an eye. Stop overseas spending, you stop the debt. If there was a magic wand that could make our national debt disappear, we would suddenly be able to increase our investments in basic research (including cancer research) over 10 fold just by reallocating the money we currently spend on interest payments. That alone should highlight why we need to reject deficit spending. What's more important to you, that we prop up dictators half way around the world or that we properly fund the medical research so that when you are older you have the best medical care available. We won't make progress until Americans start prioritizing what matters. Bailing out financial institutions and engaging in wars overseas will not help your family, but medical research and local investments will.","In the 6th district (western maryland) our savings rate is under 5%, as it is for most of the country. This means that despite a median household income of $68,000 the median family is on pace to save less than $100,000 for retirement. Adjusted for inflation it is projected that a median family will have less than 6 months reserves for retirement. According to the Wall Street Journal, as much as 80% of American households are not going to be able to have sufficient funds for retirement. If you want to judge the economy as it impacts working Americans, don't look to the GDP or the savings rates or an arbitrary index, look at the median savings rate. When the savings rate is high we do well as a country, when the savings rate is low the median household struggles and has a lower quality of life. Most tax cuts would help, however there are three core expenses which keep Americans savings rate at a subpar level: 1) Housing costs 2) Education Costs 3) Health Care Costs. All three expenses grew faster than the rate of inflation after government intervention. Policies enacted at the federal level should always be done with consideration on the secondary effects of those policies. For example: subsidizing the mortgage market does not benefit the home buyer if housing prices inflate and consume any potential consumer surplus, nor does subsidizing student loans if education costs are allowed to rise. Always look at the savings rate.","A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed. Congress should abide by their sworn duty to defend that constitution.","The Affordable Care Act, colloquially known as Obamacare, was a massive hand out to insurance companies and special interest groups in the health care industry. While the system of medical compensation and insurance is in need of overhaul we are missing the three biggest issues facing our countries health care. (1) We need to fix our food supply. Our massive subsidies for sugary and fructose based food has lead to a declining life expectancy. Americans did not one day wake up and decide to be fat, our food supply was hijacked. This is happening in other western countries, France for instance has the same obesity rates as America in the late 90's and is rising at a similar rate. (2) Our medical research, particularly basic research, is underfunded and lagging. We put over 9 times as much money into paying interest on the national debt as we do funding basic research. By 2020 China will have passed the US in Basic Research funding in nominal dollars. Adjusted for labor costs, China has exceeded the US in basic research funding since the mid 2000's. (3) We lack primary care doctors due to excessive education costs. Until the exploitive secondary market for student for student loans is addressed it is unreasonable to expect any improvements in health care access.","From a congressional level the best thing we can do for Baltimore is to keep our country out of any more unnecessary wars and allow that capital to say in the local economy to generate wealth. As we continue to enact pro-American trade policies, port cities like Baltimore will find that their economy will receive a much needed boast. A continued investment in biotech research will also allow organizations like Johns Hopkins to grow and provide financial benefit to the community. However as a landlord, the biggest thing keeping high income earners out of Baltimore City is the school system. If a voucher program is enacted then the city would bring back a strong tax base. If the school system is not addressed young professionals will keep moving to the county when their children are ready for school. In congress, I would be a strong advocate for school choice which would allow the city to retain residents in their peak income earning years.","This is too complex an issue for 250 words, but I'll do my best. Similar to the Obesity epidemic, Americans did not wake up one day and decide to be drug addicts. This was caused by bad policy both domestically and internationally. We need to treat addiction as a medical issue and offer as much treatment as we possibly can to those already addicted. The reality is that those addicted are going to have a long journey to recovery and as a nation, we need to support our fellow citizens as they break free from this terrible affliction. With regards to the supply and distribution: speaking with addiction specialists I found that most addicts start with prescription drugs and move on to drugs like heroin when the pills become difficult to obtain. Prescription drugs were initially pushed by government subsidies on the poorest areas in the country. Congress has a moral obligation to end these subsidies even if it means standing up to powerful lobbying groups. With regards to heroin: we can control the production of heroin within our borders, however most heroin is imported. The main countries involved are Colombia, Mexico, and Afghanistan. Congress needs to be willing to enact crippling sanctions on any country which cannot control the cartels. We also need to be willing to control our border. Heroin addiction has existed as disease for most of the past century, the epidemic only occurred when we compromitted our duty to a secure border.",Almost all of the necessary laws we need with regards to immigration are already on the books. The issue is the enforcement of those laws. We cannot do is allow for individuals to break the law with impunity. Nor can we allow for large corporations to use a shadow workforce of illegal migrants to undermine the wages of American workers. Nationwide use of an e-verify system to ensure all employees across the country are properly documented is a necessity. A southern border wall is necessary to reduce the flow of narcotics and human trafficking. My wife is an immigrant so I understand that our current system is inefficient and needs improvement. But we either have a country or we do not. Enforcement of our immigration laws is necessary for the safety of our country and the protection of the American worker.,"While I support free trade, free trade did not exist in the past four decades. You as an American cannot go to most other countries and get close to the same deal that foreign countries get in America. You will be regulated and tariffed out of business. If you go to countries like China, your intellectual property will be stolen and shortly after doing business with them you will find they are producing competing products with your technology. This is a suckers game. If we want to have free trade, that is what I prefer and I will support that. If we want to protect our industries and restrict trade, while it is not ideal in my estimation, that is a reasonable position. But what is not reasonable is to allow foreign companies to enjoy the rights and benefits of our domestic market while not reciprocating in like kind. I would ask the readers what benefit they have personally received from our previous trade policy. Sure you may have got a cheap plastic chair from the local big box store and that's great, but have your wages been increasing or decreasing over the past few decades? Has your savings rate increased or decrease? We can judge a tree by the fruit it bears and in the case of US trade policy, I would venture that most Americans have not received an aggregate benefit.","The Iran deal was not done in the best interest of the American people. I do not believe as it was negotiated that it would lead to long term stability or disengage us from spending in the middle east. It should be renegotiated in such a way that we avoid expanding our involvement in the middle east. If we were to engage in another war, though we would be successful on the battlefield, the financial repercussions would negatively impact working Americans.","For 25 years we had incompetent leaders dance around the North Korea nuclear program. They looked the other way when missile and fusion technology was smuggled into the country. The previous adminstrations let red lines be crossed with impunity as our country was laughed at. Finally, we have a president who is engaging in serious talks to wind down their nuclear program. I believe we have seen incompetence in our state department for so long that we have forgotten what diplomacy looks like. I would ask a simple question: Do you as a reader believe the same group of people that brought us the Iraq War truly understood foreign policy? The key to North Korea is how we deal with China. Without China, North Korea cannot exist. Without the US , the Chinese economy cannot exist in its current state. The Chinese certainly need our market, they need us to protect international trade lines. I would venture that a continued relationship with the united states is more important to the Chinese government than having North Korea as a proxy saber rattler. So I am confident with our current administration we can negotiate an end to the North Korean nuclear program without having to engage in any armed conflict.",How do you assess the Trump administration so far?,Do you support or oppose the federal tax cuts passed in 2017?

I attended his inauguration (and helped 200 of my constituents do the same) with hopes of working together on issues like infrastructure, national security and tax reform. ""If Trump succeeds,"" I said, ""America succeeds."" Unfortunately, I have been very disappointed. The constant turnover and drama inside the Oval Office is hurting America's credibility. Our country is not reality television. I am perhaps most concerned by President Trump's attacks on his own federal agencies, particularly our law enforcement and intelligence agencies including the Department of Justice, FBI and National Security Agency. We must allow the special prosecutor to pursue justice based on facts and facts alone. Now more than ever, we need qualified and consistent leadership at the State Department. By all accounts, morale at the Department is at an all-time low – and for good reason. Its budget has been slashed. Veteran ambassadors are leaving. Key ambassadorships remain vacant. Meanwhile, we are living in some of the most dangerous times we have ever seen, facing threats from North Korea, Russia, Iran, China, extremists and cyber terrorists. As Defense Secretary Mattis once said, ""If you don't fund the State Department fully, then I need to buy more ammunition."" The President needs more advisors who speak truth to power, can manage and deftly navigate policy. And, if he wants the rest of the world to take the United States seriously, he must stop Tweeting and start leading.","I voted against this tax reform bill because it did not achieve my goal of a modern code that rebuilds the middle class. While I do support reducing the corporate tax rate, this bill did so at the expense of middle-class families. The Trump tax cuts were designed with permanent cuts for corporations and heirs of large estates, coupled with temporary, expiring tax cuts for the middle class. In fact, more than 80 percent of the tax cuts included in this bill will go to our country's corporations and wealthiest 1 percent. Not only did the bill add $2 trillion to our debt, its offsets were not acceptable to me. The bill capped the state and local tax deduction and scaled back the mortgage interest deduction – both of which will hit Marylanders particularly hard. It ended the deductibility of student loans and medical expenses, the latter of which will hurt seniors. It altered incentives for charitable giving. It also repealed the requirement for all Americans to buy health insurance, which will increase premiums another 10 percent, according to economists. In the mid to late-1990s, our country saw strong economic growth, record job creation and even budget surpluses. It was achieved two ways: by structuring taxes to favor the middle class and by bringing both parties into the tent. Unfortunately, the tax reform bill did neither.","As a House Appropriator, I work overtime to eliminate as much waste, fraud and abuse within the federal government as possible. In fact, I recently ended support for a defense project in my district because reports revealed ongoing operational failures. Our national debt is one reason I opposed the Trump tax cuts of 2017, which will add $1.9 trillion to the deficit through 2028, according to a recent and troubling report from the Congressional Budget Office. Running red ink is necessary sometimes – during war, or recession, for example. But I fear the majority party is wracking up our national debt today so that it can justify massive reductions in Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and other indispensable programs tomorrow. Our debt cannot rise unchecked forever – policies must change. Budgeting is the science of priorities and balance. We need to make sure current deficit levels do not outpace our economic growth, while at the same time, be careful not to underinvest in job-generating efforts and our national security.","Yes. In the United States, income inequality -- or the gap between the rich and everyone else – has been growing by every major statistical measure for the last three decades. Today, the top 1 percent of the population owns 35 percent of the country's wealth. Raising the minimum wage could go a long way toward leveling inequality. When President Clinton increased the minimum wage in 1996, employment soared and incomes improved at every level. We also need to amend the tax structure to support the middle class, as opposed to the reform bill that passed Congress last year that favors the powerful and privileged. When the middle class does well, America does well. We also have to work harder to make sure all children have the opportunity to receive a quality education that actually leads to a job. As an Appropriator, I help fund educational programs to close inequities in education and champion full funding for formula grant programs like Title 1 and IDEA, which support schools for low income and disabled students, including Head Start.","Yes. I believe in the Second Amendment, but we also have a Constitutional responsibility to protect American citizens from harm. Addressing the sale of firearms to the mentally ill is an important first step. I also support requiring background checks for all gun sales, including those purchased online and at gun shows. And while we can't stop every mass shooting, we can reduce the carnage. In addition to banning bump stocks and high-capacity magazines, I support efforts to ban true assault weapons that are designed to inflict as much damage as possible as quickly as possible. When assault weapons or high-capacity magazines have been used in a shooting, the number of casualties has increased 63 percent. As Baltimore County Executive, I started the School Resource Officer program, which still serves as a national model. Today, in Congress, I support full funding for grant programs that can help put an SRO in every school in the country, which I strongly advocate.","The ACA got the camel's nose in the tent and has produced positive results for many – seniors especially. The bill has helped reduce the cost of prescription drugs for seniors and guaranteed they can be insured even if they have pre-existing conditions. It capped out-of-pocket expenses so that illness does not bankrupt families. More than 430,000 previously uninsured Marylanders now have healthcare coverage, which reduces healthcare costs for all. This is why I would like to see the bill improved rather than repealed. Unfortunately, the House of Representatives has voted more than 60 times to repeal the bill, and not once to improve it. I think Congress should consider a ""public option"" to stimulate competition and allowing Americans to buy into Medicare at a younger age. I would also support expanding the exemption for small businesses to reduce costs for many American employers. During ACA negotiations, I lobbied my colleagues to include an exemption for small businesses who might not have the means to provide healthcare benefits to employees. Thanks in part to my efforts, the final bill included an exemption for companies that employ 25 or fewer workers. I would have like to see this threshold increased to 50 employees to exempt even more small businesses and provide greater flexibility.","The federal government can and must maintain a reliable funding stream to support Baltimore. Critical grants are available to help Baltimore rebuild its infrastructure, hire firefighters and police officers and revitalize vacant neighborhoods. There are grants to improve Baltimore City schools and provide workforce training. As an Appropriator, I am doing whatever I can to direct federal resources to the City and ensure our state and local lawmakers are taking advantage of these opportunities.","I was proud to support a bipartisan legislative package to address the national opioid abuse and overdose epidemic. In all, the House passed 17 bipartisan bills that will expand access to overdose reversal drugs, reevaluate best practices for pain management and examine over-prescription of opioids to student athletes and veterans, among other measures. But it will also take actual funding to attack this crisis. I was pleased that the recent omnibus funding bill included $3.3 billion to fight opioids in American communities. Congress must continue to allocate a steady funding stream to support treatment and recovery, as well as efforts to stop the flow of these drugs into our neighborhoods.","I believe in real solutions to challenges like immigration and a $20 billion wall is not one of them. Neither is trying to deport 11 million-plus people. I have long supported a bipartisan and comprehensive immigration reform bill -- S.744, the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act – that passed the Senate on a supermajority vote in 2013.The bill included strong border security measures, including a 21st century ""wall"" made of technology and manpower by funding new surveillance drones, 3,500 new customs agents and additional fencing. It required the Department of Homeland Security to achieve 100 percent surveillance of the southwestern border within five years of enactment. The bill mandated the e-Verify system to ensure employers are not knowingly hiring illegal immigrants at the expense of American workers. It created a merit-based visa system to recruit the best and brightest minds into our country and provided appropriate asylum accommodations for victims of gang violence and sex trafficking. It also provided a sensible pathway to citizenship for law-abiding immigrants with stipulations that they learn English, stay employed, pass a criminal background check, pay back-taxes and a fine. The bill was both pro-growth and pro-law and order. Most importantly, it represented our American values.","I have opposed the most recent free trade agreements considered by Congress because I believe they hurt the U.S. labor market and provide few benefits to the businesses in my district. We must recognize that we live in a global economy, but our first priority must be American jobs.","Yes, I still support the bipartisan agreement. While the JCPOA remains imperfect, it is the best opportunity we have to reduce Iran's nuclear threat and its ability to export terrorism. It removes the greatest weapon from one of our most dangerous adversaries and helps protect our ally, Israel. Before the agreement, Iran was only two to three months away from having enough fissile material to build a nuclear weapon. The U.S. no longer had the support of our allies to keep international sanctions in place. The JCPOA stopped Iran's progress dead in its tracks, and crippled its ability to build a nuclear weapon for at least 10 years. Before I committed to supporting the agreement, I sought assurance from President Obama directly that the military option will be considered if Iran advances toward a nuclear weapon at any point during the deal's lifetime. In addition to international sanctions, the United States can still enforce domestic sanctions on Iran's non-nuclear activities and can still create new sanctions on the Iranian regime if needed. As Former Ranking Member of the House Intelligence Committee who has expertise in this area, I know that if this agreement breaks down, countries like Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and others that do not currently have nuclear arms, will buy them. The Middle East will be far more dangerous than it is now.","Defending our country against the nuclear threat from North Korea is one of my highest priorities as a Defense Appropriator. Our President needs to end the inflammatory rhetoric against North Korea's volatile dictator. That said, we have the technology to counter North Korea if they attack and to stop their missiles from reaching us. Support for military action among the American public remains low. For now, we have to continue exercising diplomacy and sanctions.",How do you assess the Trump administration so far?,Do you support or oppose the federal tax cuts passed in 2017?

,YES,Representative in Congress,3,John Sarbanes,Sarbanes,05/22/1962,Towson,Democratic,Baltimore County,http://www.johnsarbanes.com,jsarbanes,JohnSarbanes,http://surveygizmoresponseuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/fileuploads/296249/4299807/95-1d976555e59b57e75e8c61168aba7bd8_clarke_07126_0107.jpg,"I graduated from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University, studied law and politics in Greece on a Fulbright Scholarship, and graduated from Harvard Law School.","Before coming to Congress, I served for seven years with the Maryland State Department of Education, working to make Maryland's public school system one of the best in the nation. I also practiced law for eighteen years, representing hospitals and senior living providers in their mission to deliver high-quality health care to the people of Maryland. Throughout my career, I have been proud to work with public interest organizations in Maryland, like the Public Justice Center, where I championed efforts to protect consumers, provide decent public housing and ensure fair treatment in the workplace.","Like many Marylanders, I was dismayed by the results of the presidential election. President Trump ran a divisive campaign, fueled by resentment and centered on a policy agenda at odds with many of my core values. Since his election, President Trump has done nothing to ease my concerns about his views, temperament or policy goals. Trump has led Republican efforts to try and repeal the Affordable Care Act, signed into law a massive tax giveaway for corporations and wealthy Americans, banned refugees from Muslim-majority nations from entering our country, targeted our most vulnerable immigrants for deportation and rescinded protections against deportation for Dreamers, and attacked essential environmental protections. These examples are just a few of the many misguided and destructive policies the President supports. Furthermore, the President has made reckless threats against nuclear-armed North Korea and expanded military operations across the Middle East, all while increasing tensions with and sowing confusion among our allies with disjointed and often irresponsible statements on international affairs. On top of all these issues, he has weakened our democratic institutions by relentlessly smearing the free press, lowering the standards for our leaders' conduct and political discourse, shattering decades of ethical norms, dismissing legitimate concerns about Russian interference in our elections, and using the Presidency to enrich himself, his family, his business and his wealthy donors.","I opposed H.R. 1, the disastrous Republican tax legislation. The Republican tax bill is devastating for millions of middle- and lower-income Americans, especially in Maryland. The bill directs money to the wealthiest Americans by slashing the corporate tax rate, limiting the estate tax, and dramatically reducing the tax rates for pass-through companies. Despite raising revenue on the backs of everyday Americans, the tax legislation would still increase the deficit by approximately $1.5 trillion over ten years. Congressional Republicans have already made clear that, after their tax bill explodes the deficit, they will seek to cut programs like Social Security and Medicare. Budgets are statements of values; cutting programs relied on by millions of Americans in order to pay for tax breaks for the wealthy is unconscionable. You may be sure that I will continue to strongly support these indispensable programs. Ultimately, policies like the Republican budget resolution and tax bill are the result of the broken way in which we finance our politics. A money-in-politics system that allows corporations and the ultra-wealthy to pour money into campaigns and super-PACs will lead to policies that inflict widespread harm on the many to benefit the very few. That is why I introduced H.R. 20, the Government By the People Act, to help restore the voice of everyday Americans in our politics. The fact is, whether it's creating good jobs, education, health care or the environment, wealthy donors and Washington insiders are blocking progress on the issues that everyday citizens care most about.","While the national debt is an important long-term issue, drastically slashing spending to reduce the deficit and, eventually, the debt is misguided and counterproductive. Furthermore, ballooning the debt by passing $1.5 trillion in tax cuts and then insisting on cutting programs like Social Security and Medicare, as Congressional Republicans have done, is intellectually dishonest and would be disastrous for our country which is already dealing with an income inequality crisis. The best path towards a reduced national debt is sustained economic growth, which helps increase wages, boosts tax revenues collected by the government and organically decreases safety net spending. As the post-recession European experience has shown, austerity too often only serves to worsen economic downturns. There is no doubt that we will have to make tough choices between competing priorities. However, we must make these choices in a thoughtful way, being careful not to compromise the core values that have always sustained American progress - ensuring opportunity, strengthening community and promoting private enterprise and innovation.","Income inequality is among the most pressing issues facing our nation today. The top 10% of earners make more income than the next 90% combined. Income inequality does not just affect those who are struggling, it restricts national economic growth. Research has demonstrated that high levels of income inequality reduces Gross Domestic Product (GDP). We are all better off when economic gains are distributed more evenly. To combat this growing problem, we need to focus on economic policies that grow the middle class. These include ending tax breaks for the corporations who ship American jobs overseas, investing in national infrastructure, and raising the minimum wage. No American who works full time should have to worry about food security, homelessness, or health insurance. Also higher education, which dramatically reduces the chance that a person falls into poverty, should be achievable and affordable for all Americans who wish to pursue an advanced degree. Before we can solve this issue, we need a government that responds to the needs of the average American. The prevalence of money in politics is a corrupting force; it takes the attention away from the middle class and places it on the wealthy. I have introduced a bill, the Government by the People Act, in order to remedy this problem within our democracy. It will amplify the voice of small donors during election fundraising; candidates will need to turn their attention to where it belongs, the people.","Gun violence is a serious public safety concern in our country and Congress is long overdue in passing commonsense legislation to address this issue. I strongly believe that we have a responsibility to ensure that no more lives are cut short by gun violence. In the House of Representatives, I have consistently supported efforts to change federal gun laws. I cosponsored various legislation to prevent gun violence, urged Republican leaders to hold a hearing on federal investment in gun violence prevention research, sent a letter with my Democratic colleagues to President Trump urging him to meet with members of the Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, and voted in favor of legislation that included much needed funding for gun violence research. Like many Americans, I am deeply frustrated by the paralysis that infects Washington when it comes to progress on gun safety. But I still come to work each day believing that we can do better – that, together, we can find solutions to end the cycle of violence. We can start by appointing a Select Committee on Gun Violence. Congress needs to have a frank and transparent conversation about this scourge that is heightening fear and anxiety across every community. Let's have a robust debate about the causes of mass shootings, the impacts of gun violence on public health, and the commonsense reforms that will keep Americans safe. It is up to Congress to put public safety first, not the interests and profits of the gun lobby.","I am a strong supporter of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and have opposed every attempt to repeal or defund this important law. While there is no question that improvements could be made to further lower costs and expand access to care for all Americans, some of the problems and rate increases over the past few years are directly tied to Republican attempts to sabotage the implementation and functioning of the ACA. President Trump's decision to withhold Cost Sharing Reduction (CSR) payments is shameful and, according to health insurers themselves, one of the primary reasons for the higher-than-expected premium increases announced in some states. I support bipartisan efforts to stabilize the health insurance markets and provide relief for Americans.","I travel home every evening, an opportunity many Members of Congress do not have, so I see firsthand how badly our infrastructure is in desperate need of repair. The need is particularly acute in Baltimore. I am a strong supporter of increased funding for national infrastructure investments and a long-term surface and public transportation bill that offers a cost-effective, safe, and reliable means of travel for all Americans. Mass transit is critically important for economic development, bolstering educational opportunities and improving quality of life. I remain extremely disappointed that Governor Hogan's transportation plan pulls back state funding for the Baltimore Red Line, which would help connect West and East Baltimore. If we want to lift up Baltimore's communities and provide them with the economic and educational opportunities they deserve, we need to develop a more robust and modern transportation network throughout the city. I have continued to encourage the Governor to reconsider his decision to abandon the Red Line. Events around the country, including what transpired in Baltimore, have spurred an important debate over law enforcement tactics. I strongly support the mandatory use of body cameras by police officers as a means of gathering evidence and increasing accountability, and have called for additional federal funds so that police departments can purchase body camera technologies. It is also important to provide better training and resources so that over the long-term, law enforcement officials can implement community policing strategies that promote safety in a collaborative, rather than adversarial fashion.","I am deeply concerned about the heroin- and opioid-abuse epidemic in our Nation, which has hit Maryland especially hard. I was a cosponsor of H.R. 953, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act (CARA), and I voted in favor of a large package of bills related to drug abuse and the opioid crisis. This package included H.R. 5046, the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Reduction Act, which is similar to CARA, as well as a bipartisan bill I authored, H.R. 3680, the Co-Prescribing to Reduce Overdoses Act. H.R. 3680 creates a grant program under the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to expand access to life-saving medications to counter overdoses. More recently, I joined several of my colleagues in introducing the Substance Use Disorder Workforce Loan Repayment Act (H.R. 5102), a bipartisan bill to help increase the number of healthcare professionals working in addiction treatment and substance use disorder programs around the country. The legislation aims to close the addiction treatment gap in America – which is largely attributed to a shortage of treatment providers – by creating incentives, in the form of student loan forgiveness, for health care professionals who provide direct patient care at opioid treatment programs in high-need areas. Finally, I also serve on a Bipartisan Task Force to Combat the Heroin Epidemic whose aim is to create and implement solutions to end the heroin epidemic with a focus on expanding coordination among local and state officials, law enforcement agencies and medical professionals as well as increasing educational efforts.","My grandparents undertook an ocean voyage from Greece to begin a new life running a small restaurant here in Maryland, and committed themselves to strengthening the democratic fabric of this country. I see that same commitment in the families of our immigrant communities all throughout America. I am proud that Maryland has led the way on improving our immigration system by passing the Dream Act in our state and I will continue to support similar efforts at the Federal level. I voted against H.R. 1892, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, which failed to provide relief to the 800,000 DREAMers in our country. I am a cosponsor of H.R. 3440, the bipartisan and bicameral DREAM Act which would provide eligible undocumented youth a path to U.S. citizenship. As a strong proponent of giving DREAMers an opportunity to build a life in this country without the constant fear of deportation, I have long supported DACA, which offers undocumented youth temporary protection from removal. I opposed President Trump's efforts to end provisional residency protections for some beneficiaries of the Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program. I condemned the Trump Administration's plan to end humanitarian protections for roughly 200,000 Salvadorans – 20,000 of whom reside in Maryland. I also joined my colleagues in a bipartisan letter to Congressional leadership urging them to bring a legislative solution to the floor that would provide protection for all beneficiaries of this critical humanitarian program.","Unfortunately, our trade policies have long assumed that ""free trade"" is the same as ""fair trade."" That assumption has touched off a race to the bottom where American jobs are shipped overseas to countries with non-existent labor standards and thread-bare environmental protections. We must reset our nation's trade policies to ensure that fairness and American values guide U.S. trade agreements so that we can level the playing field for American businesses. Sadly, the machinations coming out of the White House regarding the imposition of tariffs has caused unnecessary uncertainty for the US economy. While some action may be meritorious, we need a clearer plan from the Executive Branch. U.S. trade agreements must address labor rights, human rights, and environmental protection. I place a very high priority on preserving high-wage jobs, and on increasing the competitiveness of our companies domestically and abroad.","I supported the Iran nuclear agreement because I believe it will be effective in pulling Iran back from the threshold of becoming a nuclear weapon state and in keeping Iran away from that threshold for at least ten to twelve years. Thereafter, the detection regime that will remain in place, along with other U.S. and allied intelligence capabilities, should allow the United States to discover any attempt by Iran to breakout to a nuclear weapon and to make that discovery in time to thwart such an attempt. President Trump's reckless decision not to certify Iran's compliance with the JCPOA weakens the United States, isolates us from our allies and undermines our credibility in future diplomatic efforts. There is no evidence that Iran has violated the terms of the JCPOA and the International Atomic Energy Agency, the Secretaries of Defense and State, the National Security Advisor and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have all attested to Iran's compliance. While there is no question that Iran has continued its destabilizing activities by supporting terrorism and expanding its ballistic missile programs, these issues fall outside of the scope of the JCPOA. Congress should continue to counter Iran's malicious behaviors without threatening the agreement that prevents it from developing nuclear weapons.","I believe it is more important than ever that the United States continue to support international efforts that promote peace, stability and democracy in the world. I also believe the United States must use all economic, political and diplomatic sanctions and other non-military options available to the United States to press North Korea to curb its nuclear proliferation activities and bring greater peace to the region. I believe that nuclear non-proliferation, as well as securing loose nuclear material, should be a key U.S. policy objective. Nuclear weapons testing in North Korea, a now-halted nuclear program in Iran, and instability in Pakistan all make it necessary for the U.S. to take a leadership role in reigning in nuclear proliferation. I am extremely concerned by the statements made by President Trump during the campaign that indicated a nonchalant attitude towards these destructive weapons and will fight to preserve nonproliferation as one of the chief aims of United States foreign policy. I am a cosponsor of H.R. 669, the Restricting First Use of Nuclear Weapons Act. This legislation would prohibit the President of the United States from conducting a first use nuclear attack unless such action has been approved by a Congressional declaration of war, which explicitly authorizes use of such force. H.R. 4140, the No Unconstitutional Strike against North Korea Act, would prohibit a military strike against North Korea without explicit Congressional authorization, unless the United States was attacked first.",How do you assess the Trump administration so far?,Do you support or oppose the federal tax cuts passed in 2017?

By taking out student loans I was able to continue my education, and I earned an MBA from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in 1985. I serve on the boards of American University, Furman University, the Baker Retail Center at Wharton, the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, the Atlantic Council, Suburban Hospital, the Montgomery County Chamber of Commerce, and the Wharton Graduate Board.","Starting with one store, I built my company Total Wine & More, the largest private wine retailer in the United States. We have 6,000 employees nationwide, 600 of whom are based at our headquarters in Bethesda. The key to our success is investing in our employees. That's why we pay higher wages and benefits than our competitors. In most retail, 25% of employees are full-time and receive benefits while 75% are part-time and do not. In my business, it's the opposite. 75% of our employees are full-time and get full benefits, which include retirement, PTO, and medical insurance. Total Wine & More invests in our employees by paying for them to earn their GEDs and has a pilot program with the University of Maryland that offers a four-year college degree paid for by the company. As and one of the lowest employee turnover rates in the retail industry. We pride ourselves on being a socially responsible employer. In 2002, a decade before Maryland legalized same-sex marriage, we offered partner benefits to same-sex couples. We have banned the box asking about criminal convictions on employment forms and hired over 100 returning citizens. We're working with the ACLU to encourage others to follow our lead. Total Wine & More also gives back to the communities we're in. We've given to over 7,000 local charities including food banks, women's shelters, organizations that support people with Autism, the Make a Wish Foundation, Boys and Girls' Clubs, and others that play major roles in people's lives.","The Trump administration has been a complete failure. Many of his proposals will aggravate existing problems rather than solve them. Rather than declaring a national emergency on opioids and following the recommendations of his commission, he proposes stiffer sentences for drug crimes. Rather than implementing bi-partisan comprehensive immigration reform, he's trying to deport 800,000 DREAMers. Rather than working with our trade partners, he's imposing tariffs that will be devastating to Maryland agriculture and the port of Baltimore. Good leaders find solutions that work, not just ones that appeal to their supporters. This requires a thorough knowledge of relevant facts and a dispassionate assessment of alternative approaches. Trump has shown himself not to understand the basic important facts, and his comparisons of his own proposals with alternatives depend more on exaggerated rhetoric than analysis and insights. In business school and in applying its lessons for more than 30 years since, I've learned that the best solutions are those in which almost every party involved is satisfied with the outcome. This contrasts sharply with the words Trump uses to excite his followers and the way he treats others. Treating others humanely and respectfully is more likely to result in successful negotiations than calling opponents ""bums,"" ""losers,"" or encouraging darker instincts. And I'm disgusted by the way that he treats women.","I strongly oppose them. Speaking as a business owner, this was a giveaway to people who don't need it, while hurting working families. The law is based on a series of illusions. Contrary to its proponents' claims, the law will not generate the promised economic gains; will create long-term economic problems; fails to address a series of pressing needs; and will aggravate rather than mitigate our underlying political divisions. I draw on my training in business management and more than three decades experience in running a successful business in making this assessment. For objective information about law's impact, I use the work of the Penn Wharton Budget Model (PWBM), a non-partisan effort of which I am a proud early supporter. In politics as in business, one cannot make good decisions without reliable information. PWBM's assessment finds that the promise of dramatic economic growth is an illusion. Instead, 10-year GDP growth will be only 0.6 to 1.1 percent larger than growth expected with no tax bill. The law will provide a financial windfall to the very largest C corporations, but it does not include incentives for investments that will benefit the larger economy. Proponents of the tax law mistakenly believe companies will invest this windfall in new jobs, but both history and comments by top CEOs suggest otherwise. The idea that corporate tax savings lead to job growth is an illusion; history shows us that very little of corporate tax cuts ""trickle down"" to workers.","I oppose increasing the national debt to pay for tax cuts for people who don't need them. I was an early supporter of the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a nonpartisan, research-based initiative that provides accurate, accessible and transparent economic analysis of public policy's fiscal impact. I supported this project, in part, because I believe that we need reliable analysis to assess whether short-term spending makes sense in the long-term. As I've mentioned in my previous answer, the model found that the Trump tax giveaway to large corporations is not a good long-term investment. We should not be leaving our children with debt to pay for tax cuts for people and corporations that don't need them. There are, however, investments we need to make that pay dividends in the long run. Alzheimer's is a great example. We spend over $200 billion every year caring for people who suffer from this horrible disease. That number is only going to increase as the baby boomer generation enters old age. But we spend just over $1 billion on funding NIH research on the disease. I've repeatedly called for doubling the budget of the NIH to fund research for Alzheimer's and other diseases. It's counterproductive not to invest the money now, when it could save our nations billions in the long run.","Economic inequality is a serious problem. I've been fortunate in my life to start and grow a successful business. But I didn't start out with much. I grew up on my family's struggling farm, working 12-hour shifts at $1.80 an hour, cleaning hog and chicken pens, and went to graduate school on student loans. We should raise the minimum wage immediately. Increasing the minimum wage is the best way to reduce poverty and increase worker productivity. With that, we also need to pass a law tying the minimum wage to inflation. The federal minimum wage has not gone up since 2009, and it hasn't kept pace with the rising cost of living. It would be almost $11 today if it had kept up with inflation. 35 million Americans would directly benefit from a minimum wage increase. 89% of them are 20 years or older and 30% of them are women. We also need to close the gender pay gap. Studies show that closing the pay gap for women, who make up 46% of the workforce, would be a great boon to the economy. President Trump likes to talk about economic growth, but he's rolled back Obama-era equal pay protections. This is bad for women and bad for the economy. Congress needs to get us back on the right track by codifying former President Obama's equal pay protections into law and by finally passing the Paycheck Fairness Act.","It's long past time to pass reasonable gun-safety laws. Every year, there are over 30,000 gun-related deaths in America, and we must take action to stop the violence. I'm proud of the high school students from Parkland, Florida, who have started a movement of young people who are helping to force our Congress to take action. In Congress, I'll take on the NRA and work with both sides of the aisle to pass common-sense gun safety laws. The first thing we need to do is reject political dark money. I will never take a penny from any special interest, and I'll never back down when it comes to confronting the NRA and fighting for our families. Among my top priorities for action is expanding background checks that keep guns out of the hands of people with a history of violence or serious mental illness by closing the gun-show and internet loopholes. As part of a new effort to expand background checks, we must pass laws that keep guns out of the hands of those who have a history of domestic abuse. Violent people must not have easy access to firearms. Most of the mass shootings our country has suffered have been young people who have been able to purchase military-style assault weapons. I also favor banning so called 'bump stocks' that turn semi-automatic weapons into automatic weapons, like the one used by the deranged shooter in Las Vegas.","Quality healthcare is a basic human right, and the government's job is to ensure that right for all Americans. With the passage of the Affordable Care Act, we've made great strides towards realizing the goal of universal health coverage for all Americans. Uninsured rates are at historic lows, and millions of people have gained coverage. Donald Trump and the Republican Congress want to take us backward. Their plan would cause millions to lose their coverage and make healthcare more expensive for millions more. The Affordable Care Act isn't perfect, but we need to modify and build on it, not repeal it. We need to close the Medicaid coverage gap and expand Medicaid in all 50 states. The Republican plan takes us in the wrong direction by gutting the funding for Medicaid expansion. 31 states in the District of Columbia have expanded the program and Republican Governors who were skeptical at first are now admitting that Medicaid expansion has been good for their states. Let's keep the funding and work with the remaining 19 states to close the Medicaid gap. We also need to bring costs down. Health care providers are incentivized to perform costly tests that aren't necessary. We should find ways to change the incentives so that providers are rewarded for treating patients not for performing tests. Additionally, we should focus on wellness and preventative medicine. When people are empowered to make good decisions about diet, exercise, flu shots, not smoking, and getting yearly checkups, healthcare costs go down.","Investing in education is a major step that the federal government needs to take in order to helping cities like Baltimore. Universal pre-k is the first step. There's no question that higher income kids start off with an advantage before Kindergarten even begins. One study shows that higher income kids will have heard 30 million more words by age three than their low-income peers. I support Congressman Delaney's Early Learning Act, which will create universal pre-k starting at age 4. The bill establishes an Early Education Trust Fund for the program, funded by increased efforts to ensure the wealthiest Americans pay their fair share on income, dividends, and capital gains. In addition to universal pre-k there are other steps that we must take to close the achievement gap. In too many places across the country, schools are funded by local property taxes, which puts schools in poor neighborhoods at a disadvantage. That's why I support increases in Title I federal funding for schools that serve low-income students to help level the playing field. We also need to consider innovative programs like community schools that provide programs like health and social services and community development. These schools are open outside of normal school hours and the programs are available to anyone who needs them. I also support infrastructure projects like the Red Line. Hogan's decision not to fund it was a lost opportunity for jobs and economic development in Baltimore, which would generate tax revenue for the entire state.","The opioid epidemic is the most important issue facing the Sixth District right now. In 2016, 64,000 Americans died from overdoses – my nephew Ian was one of them. Every day that we don't act hundreds of people will die. - 74,000 I've put together a comprehensive plan to tackle the opioid crisis. You can read it at davidtrone.com/issue/opioid-crisis I propose investing $100 million over the next 10 years. That may seem like a lot of money, but the cost of inaction is that 750,000 people, which is roughly the entire population of Baltimore city, people will die over the next 10 years. Additionally, the crisis costs our nation $80 billion every year in medical care, imprisonment, and lost productivity. My plan calls for teaching kids about the dangers of opioids from an early age, much like we did with tobacco in the 1990s. It also calls for restoring the DEA's authority to crack down on suspicious drug shipments. A Washington Post/60 Minutes Expose revealed that in 2016 Congress unanimously voted to take away this vital tool from the DEA. Yet even after this was brought to light, Congress has not reversed this action. This is because they are in the pockets of big pharmaceutical companies, who give more to politicians than any industry in the country. I will vote to restore the DEA's authority and I won't be taking a dime from big pharma or any other PACs or lobbyists. I want to be your Congressman, not theirs.","Immigrants are an important part of American society and should have a path to citizenship. Trump's mass deportations, travel bans, and rescinding of DACA and TPS protections are antithetical to American values. We all benefit from the rich cultural and economic diversity immigrants bring to our community. Research shows that immigrants improve the quality of life for all Americans. Immigrants and their children founded over 40% of Fortune 500 companies, including Apple, Ebay, and Google, and these companies employ more than ten million people worldwide. We also should reduce the amount of time it takes for applicants to receive work authorization. It shouldn't take someone 10 years to get a visa if they have valuable job skills that can boost our economy. Everyone who works hard and plays by the rules should feel welcome in America.","We need trade for the economy to grow. The questions are whether the trade agreements will be fair and whether we will help families and communities that are hurt by trade. We have not done either of those in recent deals. Trump's trade war will only make matters worse, though. The number one industry in Maryland has always been and continues to be agriculture. That along with the port of Baltimore means that a trade war will is not only bad for the country but will disproportionately hurt farmers and businesses in Maryland.","The nuclear deal with Iran, which the US and other major powers signed, must be enforced with vigilance. The objective of the deal – as well as our broader policy – must be clear: Iran will never acquire a nuclear weapon. If Iran is found to cheat, the consequences must be swift and severe. We must maintain the ability, and the political will, to ""snap back"" sanctions if Iran fails to live up to its commitments. All options must be on the table to prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear bomb that threatens not only Israel, but also other allies in the Middle East and beyond. Iran has tested ballistic missiles, giving rise to action by the UN Security Council, which I support. Further, the IAEA needs to make robust inspections of Iranian military sites, and we should increase sanctions for Iran's non-nuclear activities in supporting Hezbollah with weapons, shooting ballistic missiles, and funding terrorist activities throughout the Middle East. Iran could abide by the deal, and still achieve breakout capacity in roughly the next decade; specifically, further vigilance should be paid to the sunset clauses in the deal, which seemingly put Iran on a path to acquiring a nuclear weapon in a matter of years. In Congress, I will support legislation that clarifies that Iran must be sanctioned for its missile program and maintains the sanctions architecture if they cheat on the nuclear deal.","I am skeptical that the President and his administration have a well-thought-out plan to work towards denuclearizing North Korea. Trump's decision to accept a summit with Kim Jong Un gives the dictator legitimacy on the world stage. If he fails to extract any concessions, the President will have given this away for nothing. I do agree with the President that we should negotiate with North Korea and impose sanctions when they violate their agreements. But negotiations will have a higher chance of success if they are carried out by experienced professionals and not by people who impulsively Tweet about the size of their button.",How do you assess the Trump administration so far?,Do you support or oppose the federal tax cuts passed in 2017?
