The teaching profession must be elevated through higher salaries and benefits to be commensurate with other professionals with comparable training and education, to attract and retain outstanding teachers in our state.  I am committed to funding these strategies by ""lockboxing"" gaming revenues and dedicating a portion of stadium revenues to education.  If marijuana is legalized, all of those revenues should also be dedicated to education. Additionally, out-of-state online retail purchases should be taxed for educational purposes.","Transportation spending needs to reflect current and future transit needs, taking into consideration the impact on the environment of different modes, alleviating commuter times, and the differing needs of rural and urban communities. A cost-benefit analysis for competing solutions must also take into account Maryland's commitment to reduce its carbon footprint by 2020, as well as the aging infrastructure of roads, bridges and rails.   In this analysis, Baltimore City would appear to be best served by a renewed commitment to building the Red Line, with a concomitant effort to secure the federal and regional funding necessary to accomplish such a project. The safety of Maryland's bridges and rails must take the highest priority in infrastructure spending, and new road construction must be balanced with improvements to mass transit, so that the greatest numbers of citizens will benefit.","Too many citizens, especially in the African American and rural communities, have been harmed because they have a criminal record due to drug use. However, in the states where recreational use of marijuana has been legalized, the process has been rushed—criminal penalties have been removed without the necessary regulatory process to insure that usage is safe for the user as well as the general public. There are currently no uniform standards for measuring doses; setting limits for intoxicated driving or operation of boats or heavy machinery; or determining the ""half life"" for different methods of ingestion, including edibles.   Additionally, research is incomplete for early use by adolescents, whose brains are still developing, and the effects of long term use in adults on motivation, memory, acquisition of new knowledge, impulse control, depression, and the onset of dementia. Until standards are agreed upon for dosages, methods for measuring intoxication levels are developed, and more research is done, decriminalization is a more responsible approach than legalization, to reduce the mass incarceration of vulnerable communities and remove the stigma of drug use. The ultimate goal of legalization, if that is the consensus, should be a staged process that only takes place after more of these safeguards are in place.","The Chesapeake Bay is a one of our state's natural treasures and must be protected for future generations to enjoy. I believe that we need to be more proactive instead of reactive by focusing on limiting pollution at the source.   The overabundance of chicken manure on the Eastern Shore should be distributed to farms around the state to alleviate runoff of nitrates while encouraging transition to organic farming techniques. The remaining manure must be placed in properly-lined landfills to prevent the pollutants from getting into the bay.  I also support requiring that all new homes built with septic systems include state of the art nitrogen pollution removal systems. Additionally, any older houses that have to replace their septic systems should be subject to the same requirement. These measures will reduce nitrogen pollution into streams, rivers and the Chesapeake Bay.","Preventative healthcare and an investment in health maintenance on the front end, saves money on expensive emergency room visits and chronic disease management on the back end. Providing cradle to grave health care to all Maryland residents, including vision, dental, mental health, and the full range of reproductive health services, ensures equitable treatment for our entire society. To accomplish this, the state of Maryland should establish Medicare For All based on the current model that allows for people to buy a supplemental policy to cover additional costs. We should also expand Medicaid to include all low income and disabled people who are not currently covered. We should recognize and reimburse integrated health care modalities, as well.  To control costs, I support establishing a reinsurance pool to cover the sickest patients and lower premiums for everyone else, a measure which has been endorsed by the state's largest insurer, CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield. We should also request federal help to support the long term health of these reinsurance funds. Because the federal mandate expires in 2019, it is also essential to pass a state mandate in 2019--funds originally intended as a penalty would be able to applied to the mandate. Finally, eliminate price gouging by regulating name brand drugs, in addition to generics, and investigate further saving on prescription drugs through applying statewide procurement practices.","The epidemic of violent crime is a symptom of the pervasive social and economic inequities that have gone unaddressed for centuries. This kind of generational deprivation requires a holistic response. We need to insure a good education and a pathway to family-sustaining jobs to change the course for the next generation. This includes funding for afternoon, weekend and summer recreational, cultural, and employment opportunities for youth, as well as academic enrichment. Prevention and early intervention of domestic violence, child abuse and neglect will prevent future violent behavior.   Wraparound social services that address housing, health, addiction, and employment will help people achieve their full potential. The decriminalization and legalization of marijuana will reduce gang violence by breaking up drug cartels. I also support enhanced gun safety laws, including more thorough background checks, lengthier waiting period, mandatory gun safety education for gun owners, and liability insurance, as ways to keep more guns out of the hands of people who will potentially harm themselves and others.","In 1996, I lobbied for the original legislation allowing for 2% of the pension fund to be used for venture capital, which historically has provided higher returns to the pension fund than traditional investments. This has been a very successful program for stimulating innovative entrepreneurship, targeted at students who were leaving the state for a more business-friendly climate. This proven program for retaining talent instate should be expanded from 2% to 10% to continue our investment in the next generation of innovators who will plant roots here and create high-income, sustainable, family-supporting jobs in their communities.  The state also needs to focus on public-private-nonprofit partnerships between public school systems and potential employers, to identify current and future sustainable jobs and careers that will provide opportunities for entrepreneurship, vocational training in the trades, and apprenticeships, that lead to family supporting jobs. This reduces the need for expensive out-of-state recruitment, lengthy training, and relocation costs that are currently incurred by potential employers searching for skilled employees.   Maryland is strategically positioned to expand its cybertech and biotech industries throughout the state, drawing on the obvious strengths of our university and medical systems, and our proximity to major government agencies like NASA and Goddard Space Center, to attract new businesses in this sector to our state.","A non-partisan, independent commission should be established to draw legislative and congressional district maps after each census. It should respect the integrity of established communities, reflecting the cultural, religious and ethnic composition of the residents.","I believe that we need to demonstrate impartiality and transparency in law enforcement. Law enforcement officers are entitled to Constitutional due process, but they should not be immune from consequences for criminal conduct performed in their official capacity. I support the formation of statewide civilian review boards that give civilian oversight over police actions.","Opioid use should be viewed as a public health problem, not a crime. A multi-pronged approach similar to the response to the AIDS crisis should include: a public health campaign to reduce the stigma of opioid use, decriminalization, safe sites for self-administration, and free Narcan distribution and training. To begin to eliminate the black market, opioids should be legally prescribed and regulated for current addicts, coordinated with wrap around services for treatment, job training, housing, and social work. Holistic approaches, such as acupuncture (employed by Penn North, for example), should be incorporated into this public health model. Hospital emergency triage should include a unit for transitioning opioid patients into treatment, and urgent care facilities should have similar protocols. At the same time, criminal penalties for opioid trafficking and exploitation should be strengthened and enforced.","I believe the state has the ability to better facilitate economic growth and thus close income disparities, by setting a higher standard of pay, supporting education institutions at varying levels, and strengthening safety net programs such as Medicaid/Medicare, SNAP, EITC and CTC. I support raising the minimum wage to $15/hour. All employees should earn living-wages that meet the needs of themselves and their families and these wages should be indexed annually to keep pace with the cost of living by jurisdiction.  I also believe that education is key to alleviating income inequality gaps, and that the state can provide a better education for all young Marylanders. I served as the lobbyist for Advocates for Children and Youth, and from that experience I became an advocate of universal Pre-Kindergarten and instructional enrichment for children in child care.  I also hope to expand on this early childhood education base by making community colleges tuition free, providing interest free loans for public 4-year education, and tuition remission for teaching professionals within the state. We need to provide transit to help people reach potential jobs, and develop jobs within communities.","We need to use better methods for publicizing open meetings, such as aggressive use of social media and diligent posting on agency websites. Penalties for violations of the Open Meetings Act need to be strengthened, including fines, and enforced. Open meetings should be streamed live and minutes should be posted within 3 days on the agency's website and video and minutes should archived for future reference.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

Let me make clear, I believe funding education is critical for the well being of all Marylanders - now and in the future.  This Legislature's dedicating revenue from gambling taxes is a step in the right direction.  In addition to the gambling taxes ""lockbox,"" I would support doing the same for taxes collected on recreational marijuana, which I believe is inevitable.","A fully functional mass transit system is critical to the future economic growth in all parts of the State.  How are low income citizens going to move up the economic ladder if they have to travel 2 hours each way to work?  They either aren't or they will not be home enough to properly care for their children.  Baltimore needs a greatly expanded subway/light rail system.  It would not only expand job opportunities for all residents, but reduce pollution and road congestion.","I believe it inevitable that recreational marijuana will be legalized.  While I would personally recommend that it not be used, there is so much we don't know about the long term effects, I would not oppose a bill that allows for legalization.  I would make an effort to make the age when one could purchase/possess/use 26.  Those younger that 26, would be subject to a civil penalty.  Providing marijuana to someone between 18-26 would be subject to a $250 civil penalty.  Supplying marijuana to someone under 18, would be a criminal offense punishable by an up to 6 months, $1,000 fine misdemeanor.  The taxes collected on the sale would be in a ""lockbox"" for education.","Provide economic incentives so chicken farmers on the shore can move to new, less polluting forms of agriculture. Take steps to limit other agricultural runoffs from entering the Bay Mandatory re-cycling in all counties and/or requiring a deposit on plastic containers if county does not do recycling Banning of Styrofoam containers Enter into agreements with neighboring states to protect the Bay.","This year's legislature passed legislation that may reduce the increases forecasted for next year's premiums.  I would propose a program seeking doctors to volunteer their time and service to the Health Department.  The doctors would donate their service, but the State would either self-insure or pay the premium for malpractice insurance. But the ultimate solution is a single payer system.","The State currently funds a number of crime fighting initiatives in the City.  I would continue to support those initiatives that have demonstrated positive results.  I would also support the use of Maryland State Police in Baltimore doing administrative tasks, thus freeing City police to patrol the streets - especially in high crime areas.  The State should be passing tougher sentencing sanctions for violent crimes.  We seem to forget about the law abiding citizens who are sentence to ""house arrest"" for fear of coming out of their own house.","I heard that Maryland ranks 32 in the country of its friendliness for attracting new business, while neighboring Virginia ranks in the top10.  We have to have a better business climate to attract good paying jobs.  We can do this by providing tax incentives and reducing costly regulations.  But hand in hand with this, is reducing crime,  improving our schools and improving transportation.  We must see how all these issues are intertwined and cannot be compartmentalized and responded to the cries of special interest groups.  Both political parties must put people before politics.",Absolutely!,"I have worked directly with police officers for over 45 years and the vast majority are honest, sincere public servants dedicated to protecting and serving the public.  The police need and deserve the many protections afforded by this legislation.  However, the provisions of the Bill of Rights   that supersede any state, county, or municipal law, ordinance, or regulation that conflicts with the Bill of Rights; and any local legislation is preempted by the subject and material of the Bill of Rights must be changed.  Local jurisdiction should be free to legislate what limitations they deem necessary for their community.","Education, Education, Education - starting no later than Middle School, but also programs that can be adopted by businesses for use in employee training to spot when someone is showing the symptoms of addiction.  Continued training of first responders on the use of Narcan.",The Attorney General should be authorized to set up a unit to investigate any allegations and their should be civil penalties if the allegations are sustained.,I believe they do.  The Courts have consistently ruled that the PIA and open meetings laws are to be liberally construed.  Problems develop when those conducting the meeting or answering the PIA request are determined to obstruct public access.  In those incidents the agency head should have the authority to take appropriate action against the offending actor.

(1990) Hampden-Sydney College, B.A. (1986) Severn School (1982)","Attorney/Partner Carney, Kelehan, Bresler, Bennett & Scherr, LLP.  http://www.carneykelehan.com/our-attorneys/darren-burns Practice centers on litigation, particularly cases involving education, commercial construction, employment, contract, business, real property, and cable/satellite piracy issues.

Professionally, Mr. Burns is an officer for the Construction Law Section of the Maryland State Bar Association and former trustee of the Anne Arundel County Bar Association. His two decades of experience in court began with his judicial clerkship for the Hon. Robert H. Heller Jr. in the Circuit Court for Anne Arundel County.","In concept, I support the  focus on education policy, goals and structural improvements that the Kirwin Commission sought to address, and  I concur that the funding formula -- like  the setting of priorities -- required a fresh, comprehensive revisit.  At the same time, Maryland's leaders cannot accept that the  answer to  the question, ""How do we take public education to greater success?"" is simply more spending and more taxes.   Equally important is that any initiatives with such state-wide implications must be truly bipartisan and geographically diverse.   Debate  needs to be fully inclusive of all Marylanders' points of view, not merely  those of the dominant political party  or the largest counties.","It's unclear to me whether transportation spending is appropriately balanced between roads and  other forms of transit.   Achieving the balance that is right for Maryland requires an  understanding  of the geographic diversity of our state, because the right choices for the Eastern Shore shore are not the same as for the I-95 corridor or for western Maryland.  And the long-term solutions  for the urban/developed suburban areas around Baltimore and Washington are different from anywhere else, yet must be integrated with the overall plan.  At the same time, we need a realistic assessment of the condition of our existing infrastructure and the need for serious reinvestment in it.  Moreover, how we spend must be predicated on the broader plan, not merely on piecemeal, project-by-project  horse-trading . Governor Hogan appreciates this, and I support his measured approach.","No; Maryland has barely begun to implement its medical marijuana initiatives, let alone had time to assess the relative success.  However, some element of decriminalization, and with that less incarceration, appears to have merit.","The Chesapeake Bay's restoration is not an either/or question, nor is it a state vs. federal question.  Like all bodies of water among our major natural resources  (e.g., the Great Lakes, the Mississippi, the Colorado, the Everglades, the coastal waters, etc.), states  -- and groups of directly impacted states --must take the lead and insist on true partnership  at the federal level.  Maryland should re-start the process by including all stakeholders  (watermen, recreational users, environmental watchdogs, farmers, businesses) in its policy initiatives, in order to balance competing interests and reach compromise wherever possible on what we are trying to achieve.   Then, once we force ourselves to set a mission and strategic goals, we can attack how to reach them.","It's a work in progress, but  somehow we must combine the incredible  excellence of our health  care institutions  and care providers with the  ability of most  income earners to contribute to the cost of care, while funding a reasonable, sufficiently funded safety net for those who truly are without ability to pay for care.  I do not have the answers to this question, but as an elected representative I would call on our best and brightest minds to come together, regardless of party affiliation, to propose solutions.  Adopting/co-opting  recent federal ""universal"" policies is not the answer.","This is a complex issue, with both entrenched causes and  current  driving factors.   Besides the clear need for state and city officials to work cooperatively across party lines to address the problem holistically (education, child-centered  resourcing, illegal gun trade and use, and  consistent, fair law enforcement),  perhaps the State's  most important role for right now is to support the City in its efforts to  reform the Police Department while not demonizing the rank & file.  In addition, State (and City ) officials must hold prosecutors and the courts accountable for convicting and sentencing violent offenders.  The  revolving door of violent recidivism must end.","It is improving under Governor Hogan, but there is more work to do.   Government must stop seeing businesses and business owners as merely a taxable resource and instead celebrate them as the engine of prosperity and job creation.

At the same time, like any  law or policy that has been in place for a long time, it is not immune to changing community standards and expectations.  I would support a bi-partisan, diversely constituted panel to review what works, what needs to be updated, and what may no longer serve original policy goals.","We need to continue the efforts of leaders who have been willing to identify the crisis and  implement programs, like Governor Hogan and Anne Arundel County Executive Steve Schuh, and work harder at  funding them.  In addition, we need to incentivize -- or at least remove impediments -- to hospitals,  treatment facilities and other private providers to expand mental and behavioral  response and treatment, including  for addiction.","There is no magic fix for income inequality in a free society based on  capitalism and  market economy.  To start, we must understand that one key is education and career training, which can provide  families and especially  young people a  path to become income earners in way that they feel they have a stake in the economy and their own future.  In other words, citizens must believe  from their early years that hard work and playing by society's rules will actually  get them where they want to go.   At the same time, government must stop seeing businesses and business owners as merely a taxable resource. and instead celebrate them as the engine of prosperity and job creation.

,YES,state-house,30A,Alice Cain,Cain,08/30/1967,Annapolis,Democratic,Anne Arundel County,http://www.alicejcain.com,AliceJCain/,ALICEJCAIN,http://surveygizmoresponseuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/fileuploads/296249/4297291/245-3ad2ee1e114fb1d0756bcd9060fdca3a_Alice_-_photo.jpg,Bachelor's Degree from Gettysburg College and Graduate work towards a Master's in Policy Management.  I was recruited to work on the U.S. House of Representatives' education committee staff when I was one semester away from finishing my Master's.,"Executive Vice President at Teach Plus (current), a nonprofit that works with teachers to improve results for underserved students;  led grassroots campaign in support of health insurance for uninsured children at Children's Defense Fund, Senior K-12 staffer for the Education and Labor Committee for the U.S. House of Representatives (for Rep. George Miller); education policy advisor to Senator Paul Simon on the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee; U.S. Department of Education staffer in Clinton administration;  Teacher.","Yes, this is the main reason I'm running for office.  I support all five of the pillars of the commission and am especially committed to doing more to support at-risk students and building/elevating the teaching profession -- the two key goals of my job as EVP at Teach Plus.  I ave been to many of the Kirwan Commission meetings and field hearings where I have testified and organized teachers to testify, including teachers from Baltimore City Public Schools, in support of better equity in our schools.  I am a Team Leader for Strong Schools Maryland, where parents and other community leaders advocate regularly with the legislature on behalf of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education.  We have to close the funding gap, and the  MSEA's Fix the Fund initiative to send casino gaming revenue to schools in the way that was promised will help.  We also have to fix the school funding formula and make sure students who have the least get the most in terms of resources.  This is where the rubber meets the road -- I worked on the Title I formula of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act  when I was on Capitol Hill -- I know how to read funding formulas and how to write them.  I have also supported teachers in advising the state board of education on the Every Student Succeeds Act and it will be important to align that law with the new legislation from the commission next year.","I am not an expert on transportation spending but my general sense is we need to focus more on transit, i.e. public transportation, to ensure greater access to what should be a low cost and environmentally-friendly approach.  Our roads are already too congested and getting more cars on the road is not the solution.  We do need more incentives for hybrid cars, carpooling and other options that reduce traffic and pollution.","No, but I strongly support medical marijuana and Anne Arundel County needs to do a much better job making this accessible to the people who need it.","We have to fight back against the federal government's efforts to de-fund Bay restoration efforts  -- and support leaders like Senator Van Hollen who, as a leader on the appropriations committee, helped get this funding restored.  Maryland needs to join CA and other states that are actively fighting the Administration's rollback of emission standards -- this is imperative for reducing pollution and will also help with sufferers from asthma.  At the state level we have to do more to repopulate the Bay with oysters and find smart incentives to bring waterman to this effort; pass the Forest Conservation Act, which is long overdue for an update; enact the styrofoam ban;  be much more aggressive in banning use of toxic pesticides, which threaten the brain development of our children; and address over-development and all that that brings in terms of pollution and traffic congestion.  I am proud to be endorsed by the Sierra Club and am excited to work with them, the League of Conservation Voters, the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, and may others on these important issues.","When I lived in New Zealand for a year, some years ago, my friends there literally did not believe me that at the time there were 27 million Americans without health insurance.  That was inconceivable to them.  We have to start with children. At the Children's Defense Fund, I helped with an effort that got 2 million more children access to health insurance for the first time through the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)We must protect the gains that have been made in recent years, including the Affordable Care Act, and continue moving forward until everyone has access to truly affordable health care.","We have to get serious about the public health emergency of gun violence in our society.  It is not okay that people are being shot and killed in schools, at concerts, the movie theater, church, and walking down the street.  Other countries are making other choices in terms of gun policy and they are getting much better results.  I support the legislation that the legislature enacted this year, including making sure domestic abuser can't access guns and banning bump stocks, but we need to do much, more more.  And even with the best gun control imaginable, over 60% of the gun crimes in Baltimore are from guns from out of state.  We have to get serious about electing a Congress that is willing to stand up to the NRA.  We have good representation, generally, in Maryland on this but all of us can call the Speaker of the House and Majority Leader of the Senate and others with a national constituency to demand action.  We can also give money to candidates and organizations fighting the good fight to help build a counterweight to the NRA.  We will not solve this problem until that happens.","Maryland's reputation is that it's not business-friendly, but I'm not convinced that reputation is accurate. And it seems to be changing.  A recent Maryland Business Climate Survey found that senior executives at 250 businesses are feeling ""pretty good"" about the state's economy — and that they are planning to hire more people in the next year.  But they are concerned about high taxes and are having a tough time finding qualified workers.  We can continue to offer tax break packages to companies like Amazon -- and we have a real shot at winning that and bringing many new jobs to the state.  We will be more competitive in that regard, and have a stronger economy in the future if we  invest in, support, and improve our public schools -- that can be game-changing in getting more businesses will be to locate here -- they know we need the next generation to be fully equipped for the jobs of tomorrow.  We do not have as many family-supporting jobs as we need. We can start by raising the minimum wage and expanding family and parental leave.  We need to do better by teachers, firefighters and police -- who are the heroes of our society but do not always have jobs that are family-supporting.",YES.,"I am not an expert on this but it seems to err on the side of protecting the police at the expense of the public -- at a time when there have been some real problems, from Freddie Gray to Philando Castile and many others.","We have to do more to address this public health emergency, including both treatment and prevention.  I believe medical marijuana can help.  It is a tragedy that there were 119 opioid deaths in Anne Arundel County in 2016, and 152 deaths — and 1,062 overdoses — in 2017. Despite prevention efforts like the very powerful ""Not My Child"" campaign the crisis continues.  Anne Arundel County is one of the more disproportionately affected regions in the state. I will work to ensure access to treatment for individuals with substance use disorders and to ensure ready access to Naloxone. I strongly support the public health department's efforts to support 19 ""peers"" to assist with various recovery initiatives but we must do more. We must include peer expertise in prevention efforts as well as treatment and recovery. I strongly support the Safe Stations initiative as well.  As an immediate next step, as Delegate, I would like to create a Task Force that includes people who have suffered from opioid addiction to get their input and ideas for how to address this public health emergency and save lives. I appreciate Anne Arundel County Public Schools' efforts to reinstate the DARE program (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) but am concerned by research showing that it is generally ineffective. Awareness and prevention are imperative and I would like to work with the school system to ensure that AACPS adopts the best possible prevention efforts.","Building the strongest possible public schools is the key.  This starts with investing in a universal Pre-K system. It is also essential that we strengthening labor unions and ensure that workers have the right to organize and to collective bargaining.  We also need to ensure that the new federal tax law, which is highly skewed over time to benefit the richest of the rich at the expense of the rest of us does not take hold here.   It is imperative to raise the minimum wage to $15/hour and ensure a truly living wage for all.   We must strengthen organizations like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and maintain and strengthen safety net programs like the EITC and  SNAP, and Medicaid.","Democracy depends on the public's right to information about government activities.  Maryland's Public Information Act grants the people of this State a broad right of access to public records while protecting legitimate governmental interests and the privacy rights of individual citizens.   On balance, I think it does a good job.  I will always err on the side of more transparency to the public and more accountability from public officials.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

I believe that higher percentage of lottery revenue should be earmarked for education. The money should be used as additional funding and we need to ensure that the money budgeted for education originally is spent on education and nothing else.","Maryland spending appears to be balanced. The state has been updating the highways over the last decade to meet our needs. The BaltimoreLink has been getting some positive feed back however,  I feel that more time is needed to see out it is working in the best interest of the citizens.","I support legalization of marijuana. Currently the criminalization of marijuana only benefits criminal enterprises. If marijuana is legalized law enforcement can focus resources on serious drugs. Legalizing marijuana would make it harder for juveniles too obtain it, currently they can purchase marijuana from the local drug dealer.",We should offer tax incentives for individuals and companies that implement environmental changes like installing rain gardens or recycling.,Maryland has already taken steps with passing a bill that would establish the reinsurance program.  The state should build off of this and continue to protect affordable healthcare for the citizens.,As many of our tourist flock to Baltimore the state should play an advisory role in addressing the violent crime. The state should lend its law enforcement resources to Baltimore in the form of intelligence and man power.,Offering better business incentives as well as fostering entrepreneurship from within the state would grow Maryland's business climate.,Yes I believe this would allow for accurate representation.,The bill should be changed so that an outside agency should handle complaints. Although there may be bias perceived no matter what law enforcement agency investigates complaints the results may be believed if it doesn't come from the accused's own agency.,"Work on legalization of marijuana,  all the resources wasted on marijuana prohibition reinvested in fighting opioids.",Offer job training programs and affordable education.

As a member of the House Appropriations Committee, I voted for the 21st Century School Facilties Act that increases funding for schools up to $400 million.  I offered an amendment to the bill that was approved for an additional $10 million for school safety grants.  I supported the bill for the constitutional amendment on this year's general election ballot for the lock box of gaming revenues for education.","Representing the Fort Meade, BWI, and Arundel Mills Area, priority of dollars from the state administration are needed in this economic vibrant area of the state.  The Transportation Trust Fund needs to be protected to specifically fund transportation project.  Additional plans are needed in transit to address the congestion in the district I represent to support the significant development and economic engine of the state.  In my opinion, the cancellation of the Red Line did not help serve the transit needs.",I only support medical use of marijuana.,"I voted for the resolution giving power to Maryland's Attorney General to sue the federal for cutting funding the Chesapeake Bay and other important environmental projects.  Chesapeake Bay Trust Fund needs to be dedicated to protecting the bay.  Unfortunately, the Governor issued an executive order eliminating the required for BAT technology on septic tanks.  Executive orders like this threaten the treasured estuary.  I support legislation to protect our water quality with best available technology.  Throughout my first term in the Maryland General Assembly, I have received a 100% score from the Maryland League of Conservation Voters.","Maryland has the world's best healthcare systems like University of Maryland and Johns Hopkins in our state.  As a member of the Public Safety Subcommittee, I supported additional funding for Shock Trauma.  Investments in underserved community with access to healthcare needs to be increased.  Programs like Children's Health Insurance Program need to be protected from cuts.  Investments in primary care accessibility for all populations are needed to support preventive medicine.","As a member of the House Public Safety Subcommittee, I voted for budgetary items that entail state and city prosecutors and law enforcement working jointly to address violent crimes.  Harsher felony convictions are needed for violent crime offenders.","Maryland is a leader in the business climate with a diverse portfolio of business sectors in the state.  Cyber, defense, and manufacturing are strong industries in the state that support the greater community.  Maryland is heavily reliant of federal government jobs.  The state needs to continue invest in workforce development programs for all segments of the population.  Maryland has a great education system that helps students meet the demands of the labor needs of the state.  Instead of billion dollars of tax credits to one specific firm, policies are needed to support firms of all sizes, sectors, and in diverse geography to provide family-supporting jobs.","Yes, I support he creation of a non-partisan, independent body to draw legislative and congressional district maps after future census.","Time will tell on the LEOBR of the balance of protections for police and public.  Fair due process is needed to support police officers in doing their jobs.  Policies that promote police and community relations will help in bridging the two stakeholders together for the better good of public safety.  As a member of of the House Public Safety Subcommittee, I hear frequently that morale and recruiting are at historic lows in law enforcement agencies.  I support continual improvments to LEOBR to protect the majority of police officers who serve with integrity our community.","Educational programs at a younger age on the opioid crisis are needed.  Additional healthcare facilities and professionals are needed to meet the demands of opioid addictions.  As a certified Narcan administer, additional funding for health departments are needed to support training the community in Narcan and the signs of opioid addiction.  Felony penalties are needed on healthcare professionals who abuse the administration of pain medication.  Also, felony penalties need to be strengthened on drug dealers of the fatal drugs.","In my district, there are areas that struggle with poverty are in the shadows of the economic prosperity of the region.  Targeted workforce development needs to continue in those underserved areas.  Transportation needs to be more accessible for underserved areas to access good quality jobs.  Economic revitalization needs to be invested in areas of the state that have economically underserved areas.","For the most part, the PIA and open meetings laws allow more transparency for Marylanders to exercise oversight of the government.

,YES,state-house,34B,Jan Marie Christensen,Christensen,03/13/1965,Bel Air,Republican,Harford County,,,,,AA Degree in Dental Hygiene 3 years apprentice  Interior Decorating,Dental Hygienist Small Business owner Antiques By Design,Yes I would support legislation and policy that improves innovative education and evaluates funding for state public schools in conjunction with  the reviews the commission presents . I would support policy that helps prepare our students for the workforce. This commission will help identify economically disadvantaged students and how to address the declining student. I would support policy based on their findings.,I support Governor Hogans plan to relieve traffic congestion. These projects will improve our state highway system . I support the administration state highways plans and infrastructure which will help support our private sector. I support express toll lanes on the Baltimore Washington parkway.  All of this will allow for a much safer and quicker commute to and from work.,"No  I do not support another gate way drug being legalized especially with the addiction epidemic were are facing . I think we will see how medical marijuana affects our community's first. The marijuana is 30% stronger then it was years ago. A person just needs a certificate from a doctor to purchase marijuana, not to exceed 4 ounces a month and at a cost of over three hundred plus dollars  an ounce.  All cash only business. A person with no medical background will assist in picking out which type of marijuana a patient needs. Medical marijuana  will lead to less motivation, driving while impaired and more homeless. Colorado is having it's share of issues since it became legalized.",We need to continue to remain to be committed to build on the progress made in restoring the bay and local waters. The EPA will have documents that are key points that will help support ways to control pollution needed to keep the bay clean. Upgrades of water treatment plants  throughout the bay watershed have helped reduce pollution . I would support policy that will reduce pollution based on the results of the EPA and its findings.,"We need to address torte reform, have better health insurance options with lower premiums. Much more streamline plans that address the consumers needs. We still need to address the VA to insure our veterans have optimal quality care with less waiting. Reject efforts to bring back the mandate. Reform medicaid and  find waste. Expand access to healthcare through the private sector. Make sure our people working in the medical fields are able to have quality time to care for their patience rather then quantity over quality.",We need more correctional facilities so we can have room for repeated violent offenders. Our criminal justice system has moved away from protecting the innocent and I want to see that changed. We need to have more support for our police officers and let them know we are behind them. Drugs and gangs need to be addressed with more manpower to help reduce the violence it brings to our communities. Outreach with the communities that bring police and the people together like PAL programs. The culture of our communities needs to be addressed as well.,Maryland's business climate has too many regulations example the brewery's have had to form a task force to fight the regulations on their business's. The taxes and expenses to start a business need to be reduced . We have not been a business friendly environment. We can do better. Governor Hogan has made changes in the right direction. We need to keep moving in these directions to keep us competitive and  have incentives to promote small business so they can thrive. We need to support policy that helps small business hire more people not regulate them so much that it's a constant struggle.,it could not be more clear that our state was fixed blue through an unnatural division of the population to support a partisan voice and render those unrepresented in the legislature. Our votes have been compromised by gerrymandering. I will support a more fair redistricting  non partisan approach .,I do not support our police officers being suspended without evidence and having their careers ruined after an investigation turns up no evidence. I support The Bill of rights because it provides law enforcement with privileges based on due  process. I do not support a board making decisions for our law enforcement unless  those who reside on that board have worked in law enforcement  and are experience in the field. We need to continue to  support  law enforcement while understanding the citizen as well. We can not live in a lawless society and its becoming more difficult to keep good well trained officers with the currant state of affairs we have been experiencing in our country.,I would support more scholarship based programs that allow the addict to work to help with his expense's during treatment. I strongly believe in walk in detox with mental health facilities safe stations at our fire house's . Continue to help law enforcement with their needs to get the drugs off the streets and tougher sentencing for drug dealers. The person has to want treatment. I support our prison systems having drug rehabilitation that will help them remain clean like Hartford county. Acquiring empty buildings to be renovated into treatment centers to allow more opportunity for those that need help. We do not have enough beds or programs to keep up with the demand.  I would support an easier pathway to allow families to get custody of orphaned children to keep them from foster care or while the parent is not able .,This begins with education. We can not keep passing students who have not mastered the basics. We are setting our children up for failure which does not help with income inequality. This keeps those from being able to obtain higher wage jobs. I would support more trade schools. Bring back the trades in high schools. More technical high schools if needed. Help support business friendly policies so employers can afford to higher more people which creates jobs. Support programs that will help single parents attend schools or trades. Help people get off welfare and working.,I feel all government activities need to be disclosed to the public. I believe we need more transparency  and oversight to eliminate waste and abuse. Monies need to go where they are to go and not be in a slush fund at the expense of the tax payer. It seems to me that we are not doing enough to provide and ensure our citizens with where  monies are going example education in Baltimore city. The use of our tax dollars going towards battles outside of our state that could be better spent in our state . The casino monies we were told it was going towards education yet it did not . Therefore I feel we must need more government oversight and policy's to be more specific.,"Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

President, League of Women Voters of Maryland.","Yes.  Teacher training, teacher retention, and teacher development are among the important issues addressed by the Kirwan Commission.  Career and technical education is also recommended.  Prekindergarten for all four year olds and disadvantaged three year olds is important.  We could fund the PreK programs by expanding our revenue by collecting online sales tax, and using all the casino income that is for education to boost education funding, rather than a substitute for state funding.  Additional revenue for the Kirwan Commission recommendations could be obtained by collecting corporate taxes that are presently being evaded.  We could solicit grants for teacher education and development.","Maryland's transportation needs must be met by a combination of roads and mass transit.  It was a mistake not to build the red line in Baltimore which would better serve Baltimore in a fast, efficient way to connect residents to jobs. Across the state we need more transit hubs that are collection points for buses and car commuters to change onto trains for longer distances.  Transit must be environmentally friendly with use of electricity where feasible.  Lowering tolls was a politically expedient thing to do, but it is resulting in loss of money for transportation and raising the toll somewhat should be considered among other ways to raise money.","Marijuana should be legalized so that it can be controlled and taxed.  Adulteration of marijuana with PCP, or other substances can be very harmful and lead to addiction or death. A system like the control of alcoholic beverages would be the sensible way to go for Maryland","Although hampered by loss of federal funds, Maryland can take stronger measures--to control the outpouring of pollution from huge farming operations--the Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs)--that produce more chicken and pig manure than they can properly handle, resulting in it seeping into the Bay--the State can refuse pipe lines to the LNG port, Cove Point, to which ships from China, etc. bring pollution, including harmful invasive species, up the Bay-. They can induce the other Bay states to do more on their part.  More cooperation is needed from states like Pennsylvania whose sediment from the Susquehanna has loaded the Conowingo Dam.   They can step up education efforts for Bay-friendly private actions.","Ideally, health care would be free to all through an expansion of Medicare.  Mini clinics should be established in all areas of the city and underserved rural areas to provide easy access to administer preventive care and care for conditions that can be treated before they become worse or chronic.  The CHIP services for children need to be fully financed so we have a healthy population ready to take their places in a happy and productive world.","We need more support for law abiding policemen who can take gang leaders off the street.  Money for more police could come from the state.   At the earliest age, young people need constructive things to do and protection from gangs.  Teenagers and young adults need jobs.  The state can award grants for jobs and education to prepare young people for jobs.   We need to find a way to reduce the number of guns on the street.  Requiring registration for all guns  may help.  Reducing the demand for drugs would help reduce the drug dealers and the turf wars, so state support for drug treatment could help.","Maryland's business climate could be called a B+.  The state needs to foster training for high tech jobs and make higher education more affordable.  On the secondary level there should be more vocational technology courses in connection with industry and courses to prepare workers for the 21st century jobs.   The overall tax structure is not the highest and quality of life is high, attracting businesses who want a good life for their employees.","Yes.  Gerrymandering is robbing the voters of their voice in choosing their elected officials.  An independent commission should be chosen with the responsibility of creating contiguous, compact, and equally populated districts.","The LEOBoR is overly protective of police officers. Especially questionable is the provision that there be a 10-day ""cooling-off"" period before the office is questioned.  This can lead to comparing stories and getting the most exculpatory explanation for the action in question.  In the Freddie Gray case the delay in investigation and the lack of information for the public certainly did not help ""cool off"" the great disturbance that followed. I agree with the analyst who said, speaking of the rights to bathroom breaks and breaks for food and water, all suspects should have these rights and it says something about how suspects are treated that the police need to spell these rights out in their case.","The unfortunate opioid crisis is a difficult problem that we are struggling to deal with.  Loose, careless over prescribing of opioids by physicians should be checked.  Alternative methods of pain control need to be available.  Police, EMTs and firefighters and parents need to be trained in use of Narcan. We need more treatment centers and follow up for months to reinforce the choice not to use opioids. This is expensive.  Insurance plans need to cover treatment.  Users need to be helped.  Dealers of opioids need to be arrested and if they are addicted, need to undergo detox as a condition of sentencing.","The state should have a more progressive tax system including estate taxes for very large estates. Maryland should make education a priority with technical education on several levels, encouraging high paying industries to come because of the skill level of the Maryland worker.  The middle class has been maintained largely through the bargaining power of unions, so collective bargaining should be encouraged.  It should be unnecessary to induce companies  with several billion dollars in tax credits to come to our state.","Not entirely.  If you know just what information you want specifically, it still entails a delay and a considerable fee to get records from the state.  This time and expense could be crucial in overseeing the government.  There is constant attention needed to see that government agencies and officials don't make decisions beyond the sight of the public, as in closed committee meetings, teleconferences, meetings closed without justification, etc. and simply announce them later.  Agendas and minutes of meetings are not always  readily available to the public in a timely fashion, making oversight of the bodies' deliberations difficult.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

,YES,state-house,21,Matt Dernoga,Dernoga,10/12/1988,College Park,Democratic,Prince George's County,http://www.mattdernoga.com,mdernogaD21,mattdernoga,http://surveygizmoresponseuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/fileuploads/296249/4297291/191-c69df19b1df4b07352f940084211d624_Headshot_smaller_size.jpg,"I hold a Bachelors Degree in Government from the University of Maryland, and a Masters in Public Policy with an environmental policy specialization from the University of Maryland, College Park.","For seven years (Up until January of 2018), I did legislation, budget analysis, and constituent services work in the Prince George's County Council District 1 office, which represents the Laurel, Beltsville, College Park, and Adelphi areas.","Although the final report has not been issued, I have read the preliminary report and support the findings. The associated reforms are projected to cost an additional $3 billion dollars.  I believe a small part of the funding can come from existing efficiencies in transportation and energy usage, as well as curtailing the salaries of central administration that have risen 3-4 times as quickly in the last 10 fiscal years as instructors salaries.   The millions allocated for grants to attend private schools should also be cut.   However, most of this funding will need to come from new revenue.  The General Assembly's recent action to require a lockbox for the casino revenue helps. Additional revenue sources I would support:  close the combined income reporting loophole, responsible marijuana legalization with most of  the revenue directed to education, increasing the cigarette tax by another dollar,  adding an additional tax bracket for millionaires,  applying the sales tax to online purchases, and undoing the estate tax cut for millionaires that was enacted in 2014.","I think Maryland spends too much on roads and not enough on transit. Based on the facts and evidence available, widening roads does not solve traffic congestion, yet Maryland invests heavily in building new roads and widening existing ones.   We already increased the gas tax a few years ago to fund our transportation needs, the problem is that Governor Hogan has redirected too many of those dollars to highway projects, and away from the transit projects promised, especially the red line. The Red Line was meant to address transit inequity in Baltimore providing East-West connectivity and increasing access to job centers in the city and suburbs. Over 30% of the population in Baltimore has no access to a private vehicle.   BaltimoreLink an earnest effort to improve the efficiency of the bus routes in the city, and add a few dedicated bus lanes. However, at the end of the day there is too much vehicle traffic on the roads in Baltimore and the surrounding region. A subway would have helped to alleviate that traffic, it would have been a game-changer. The bus route improvements are more about tinkering around the edges than a game-changing investment.","Yes, with smart regulations based on the best practices identified in other states. The current approach to marijuana does not work. Anyone who wants to smoke it can easily find it. The problem is the drug dealer providing it isn't checking for ID, could be selling a dangerous product, and could try to ""upsell"" the marijuana user to harder drugs such as cocaine or heroin.   A far more intelligent approach is to legalize it, regulate it, and require the checking of IDs so that a person cannot purchase it legally unless they are 21 or older. A cashier as a store selling marijuana will not try to get the customer hooked on a harder drug.   An additional benefit is that under legalization, the sales can be taxed. A portion of the revenue should be used to assist with drug addictions. The remaining revenue could be used to help balance the state budget, or fund critical initiatives around education, health care, economic development, and/or the environment.   Based on the evidence I have looked at, states that were early adopters of legalization have not encountered the public health or public safety problems that opponents warned about. At this point, there is a stigma associated by some with marijuana use, but it is not anymore dangerous the cigarettes or alcohol, in fact it's less dangerous.   To reiterate, it should only be legal for adults 21 and over. This provision should be strictly enforced with major fines for non-compliance.","We need stronger MS4 permits with sharper teeth to ensure local jurisdictions meet their goals for reducing impervious pavement.   We need stronger standards across the state for the building industry when it comes to treating stormwater pollution with Environmental Site Design.   We need to require Best Available Technology  for septic systems, Governor Hogan undid this regulation.  We need a stronger forest conservation law that maintains at a minimum a no-net-loss of forests. That law also needs to make it much harder and more expensive to build in areas where there are 200+ acres of contiguous trees.   The current oyster protections are for 25% of the oyster beds in the MD portion of the bay, and in order to achieve greater oyster restoration, I think we need to expand those protections as much as possible.   We need to maintain and/or enhance catch limits for Menhaden, another filter feeder. It's important to also enhance protections for female crabs to improve the crab population in the bay.    In terms of agriculture, my understanding is that the Maryland Dept. of Agriculture is inspecting less than 10% of the state's farms annually. A beefed up inspection regime is necessary to ensure farmers are following their nutrient management plans, implementing agreed upon best practices, and meeting the required reductions of phosphorus.   Finally, we need to better fund staffing at agencies such as MDE, so that they have the inspectors and staff needed to enforce our current environmental laws.","The reinsurance legislation recently passed to stabilize premium increases by covering catastrophic claims for members enrolled in Maryland Health Benefit Exchange (MHBE) plans is a good step. An addition short run stop-gap measure we need is to pass the individual mandate that the removed by Congress.   Although expanding medicare is the long-term solution, this will likely need to be done at the federal level, or at a minimum Maryland would need a federal waiver, which is unlikely until there is a new president. Therefore, an additional long-term solution Maryland can do absent federal approval is to create a program where residents without health insurance, but with income levels above the current Medicaid eligibility, can buy into Medicaid . Arguably, Medicaid expansion has been the most successful part of the affordable care act in states that adopted it, such as Maryland .   Further expansion would involving creating a ""Medicaid plan"" that would be offered as an option on the Maryland Health Connection. Combined with a strongly enforced individual mandate to ensure young healthy people buy-in, there should be a cap on the percentage of income charged as a premium. In part, the existing ACA subsidies middle-income consumers get could be used to cover part of the cost of their premium.","The main roles the state should play in helping Baltimore address violent crime is to help improve the economy and quality of life in Baltimore. Two significant linkages to high crime areas are low levels of education and high levels of unemployment. Here are three specific areas that need attention:   1. Greater education funding and resources for public schools to ensure children receive a first-class education so they are college or career ready.  In addition, after-school programs are needed to help keep young people out of trouble and teach them life-lessons that might be missing in the classroom.   2. Better transportation options to connect Baltimore residents without a car to employment opportunities. The Red Line, which would have been a transformative project for the city in helping to do this, must be restarted.   3. Greater investment in quality, affordable housing and mixed-income housing opportunities so that working class residents can afford to live in desirable neighborhoods, and so students attending area schools have a more diverse range of income levels. The Maryland Affordable Housing Trust and Low Income Housing Tax Credit should be expanded with Baltimore City in mind.","Since Maryland's unemployment rate is 4%,  I think characterizations about Maryland's business climate as being poor are blown out of proportion. What we need to do is hold employers accountable to ensuring these jobs pay a living wage, are pro-family by offering parental leave, and by providing for more opportunities for unions and unionization so that employees can collectively bargain for wages and benefits. We also need greater investment in the trades so that young people who are not college bound can still find a high quality job after graduating high school   That said, I believe larger businesses and corporations are often able to take advantages of complex regulation and tax breaks while small businesses either cannot access these, or navigate them because of the complications. I could like to level the playing field to that small businesses can compete, but making sure we have consistent and common sense regulations. An additional way to support small business is by creating partnerships with Maryland's bank deposits and community banks to drive more local lending to small businesses in need of low-interest credit.   I would also like to improve state laws so they support non-traditional business models, such as B-Corporations, co-ops, and employee-owned businesses. For example, there is model legislation out there that creates incentives for employers to opt to sell their business to their employees. Broad-based employee-ownership is a proven strategy to build assets for workers, retain jobs in our neighborhoods","Yes, I would vote for this, even though it would hurt to do it unilaterally. I got back to this position in a roundabout way. I was far more supportive of the idea of an independent commission before Donald Trump got elected and teamed up with the Republican Congress to overturn environmental and health care protections. Since then I have had reservations about moving forward with an independent commission unless a comparable conservative state does the same. But  I recognize that redistricting reform is the right thing to do, that many voters in both parties believe that gerrymandering in bad government. I am a strong proponent of good government, and so if this legislation of an independent redistricting commission came before me, I would not feel right voting against it.","No, while I support the work of individual police officers and recognize they have a difficult job to do, I think the Law Enforcement Officers BIll of Rights makes it harder to punish officer misconduct. Here are two key problems in it we need to reform:   1. There is currently a 90 day time window by which someone must file a complaint over police misconduct. This is an extremely narrow statute of limitations.  I think all allegations of police brutality be investigated no matter the filing date.  2. Officers currently have a 10-day window before being interviewed by investigators following an alleged incident. I think this 10-day window should be removed.","The legislature as taken some positive steps, in particular making naloxone available over the counter and updating the prescribing guidance for doctors. Here are three additional steps we can take:   1. Requiring health insurance plans to cover Naloxone (or the spray version Narcan)  so that it is more affordable for the public. Without this coverage, the drug costs $140-$190 out of pocket, which puts it out of reach of many of the drug users and their families who may need it to prevent an overdose death.   2. Making Naloxone more widely available in public, for example at community centers or schools in the case of an overdose. Training nurses or someone on staff at these types of facilities to administer it would also be critical.   3.  There is a significant lack of therapists who specialize in both mental health and drug addiction. This can make it particularly hard for a person in need of therapy to address their drug addiction from receiving the professional help they need before they overdose, because waiting times for the kind of combined treatment they need for a mental health issues and an addition can be a few weeks to months. We need to invest greater resources in attracting and training these kinds of health care professionals.","There is a lot the state can do. Here are a few that would be a priority for me:  1. Phase in over the next 4-5 years an increase in the minimum wage to $15 an hour.   2. Support private sector labor unions by requiring state and local assistance and tax credits for development projects use project labor agreements during the construction, and union labor during the operation of the facility. Collective bargaining rights are critical to combating income inequality.   3. Fund universal pre-k, in part through closing the combined income reporting loophole that benefits corporations, and by adding a tax bracket for millionaires.   4.  Undo the estate tax cut for millionaires, and apply it to estates worth $1 million or more.   5. Broaden the sales tax base to be more equitable by taxing services used by the wealthy, such as country club memberships.  6.  Stop giving tax breaks and credits to large corporations in Montgomery County such as Amazon, Marriott, and Lockheed Martin.","While there are good provisions, a few observations I have seen and heard over the years are that the legislative sessions should be live video streamed like CSPAN, this currently only takes place with committees. In addition, while committee hearings are streamed, it is far harder if not impossible for the public to stream the meetings for the actual votes.   In addition, public information act requests often  come with large fees, which can make it prohibitive for citizens to investigate wrong-doing by agencies These fees should be curtailed.   Finally, at a minimum there needs to be a greater level of transparency on possible linkages between campaign contributions and state contracts.  In my view, corporate contributions to candidates in Maryland should be banned, or donating to a state candidate should disqualify a company from receiving a contract. This would snuff out any perceptions or realities around ""pay to play' as it relates to our campaign finance system.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

Linda Dorsey-Walkers jobs have allowed her the opportunity to do significant budget work,  as well as draft and testify on more than 24 bills that became laws.  She drafted leguslation that created the  MD Dept. of the Environment","Test score are not a social evil.  They can be, and should be an important barometer of where Maryland schools stand relative to  the rest of the world.  Throwing $1.5 billion dollars at schools, with too many parameters that only led to money being spent in the same way that it always has been spent, resulted in few changes.  At no time did anyone state, let's step back and look at the really big picture.  First, the algorithm used for determining where are built should not be based on  the number of existing homes, but should also include all the housing starts issued to developers, so schools don't open three years latter over-crowded. Maybe one size does not fit all.  Maybe some urban schools need ele-middle schools so that kids who are growing up too fast  stay in a safer setting..  Early College, now available in  three or four Maryland schools, should be spread  to more schools to encourage students to take academically rigorous courses in middle school with the prize being a high school diploma and AA degree (half of college completed for free by 18).  Most important,  1) ""harden "" school buildings making them safer for all occupants by adding cameras that can pivot (none do presently) and more SRO's;  2) Make computers available to every student, but also limit their use by some teachers as babysitters, which has also led to student unwillingness to write or spell; 3) Free administrators to discipline schools as needed, including suspensions.","Maryland must modernize and develop highspeed rail and innvest in smart asphalt highways and solaroads. MTA made a brief limited attempt under the Baltimore Link program to reduce traffic on I-695 between Owings Mills and Towson, but they did a bad job of marketing the service.  Baltimore County and MTA should have marketed the program together and provided free or reduced monthly passes since the bus stopped in front of the Courthouse.","No.  As a former DHMH Manager for the Maryland Cigarette Restitution Fund Program who has travelled to every county in the State of Maryland to give training about the medical ravages of smoking as a habit and the health implications of smoking and vapping, I oppose smoking  and tobacco consumption of any sort.  That includes marijuana smoking.  Until Maryland passes a law that states parents and other passengers in cars and other closed areas who smoke in the presence of children should face punishment, I will remain against  smoking marijuana.  I don't care to have it smoked in my presence, and there are many persons with asthma and COPD who  would have their rights to a smoke free environment tread upon once again by self- obsessed smokers.  I agree that marijuana in an edible form should be available when  prescribed as medically neccessary,  so long as it is safely stored away from children.","Despite the federal government waning support of the Cheasapeake Bay Restoration, Maryland must step up and commit that we will not slide backwards as a State  and lose our existing investments in restoration of our waterways.  We must clean algae and other plant and animal life that cannibalize our health sea grasses and destroy wildlife which still plays a big role in our commerce and tourism. . Maryland must continue to monitor and reduce the use of deliberate indutrial contamination  and stiff fines should be imposed.  Contamination due to  water run-off from lawns contaminated with chemicals. must be a continuing matter of educating the public about their responsibity.  Environmentally we most protect our fresh water resources, clean clogged sewer lines and use the removed debris for landfills.","Health care is not a privilege, it is a right, therefore I believe in Universal coverage.  Current clients can face the option of totally free Medicaid health coverage or  expensive Marketplace health Coverage or risking no coverage at all due to a $5 income in annual income.  The State needs to revamp the  Health Benefit Exchange, especially since the mandatory penalty of $695 per yer per person should never have been put in place.  Currently any client earning even one dollar over the upper Medicaid income limit is forced to  purchase Marketplace health coverage.  The least expensive of the Maryland options, Kaiser Permenante has a mandatory $1500 per annum deductible and a  month change  or anywhere from 130 per month if there are no office visits.  What is never told the clienis that the Affordable Care Act states that individuals may be exempt from paying the $95 fine for having no insurance if they can  prove that the least expensive Marketplace health coverage plan in their area would exceed more that 8.5% of their annual income.  Any client who anyway near the upper Medicaid  limit easily meets this test, any unfortunately  would like opt out of having any health insurance all because of exceeding a set limit by a few dollars per year.","Maryland should not run the Baltimore City Police Department, but should give the City Administrators the financial resources, equipment, and manpower training resources it needs.  Bring in exports from around the countryand allow front line working officers a day off to listen to and learn best practices.  Every Baltimore City should  has in addition to in-service training a full one day training day annually with other officers from around the state and other types of law enforcement agencies.  The Statehouse could help a lot by not making crime in Baltimore City sound inevitable to visitors.","Not yet as booming as it could be.  Maryland must modernize and develop highspeed rail and innvest in smart asphalt highways and solaroads.   Clean, renewable, and sustainable energy must be our focus. Maryland needs to develop primacy in emerging industries like wind turbine manufacturing to reduce utility costs, put solar collector panels atop State highway walls, and invest in sustainable solar streetlights.","Absolutely.  Redistricting should not begin on day one with the premise that here is where are our encumbants live, let's protect them by drawing a pie shape out away from their homes. That's no way to restrict.  It doesn't consider common communities or compactness. Moreover, in some cases makes it mathmatically impossible for some groups to win a seat.","Having planned and put on four statewide law enforcement conferences in Maryland, attended by approximateley 350 officers each time , one of the things stressed is truth can not become the biggest victime when an officers sets foot on a stand to explain his or her actions.  David Simon ,  creator of ""The Wire"" talks about young officers learning and being iencouraged to lie.  This insidious practice must end.  No officer existing a cruiser should ever think twice about whether to leave the sound and video on when it comes to their body camera, and all officers must be provided one.  We can  not have the rights of officers safeguarded unless we concurrent safeguard the rights of citizens.","Limit the free samples of certain new pain-killers issued by doctors.  Set an average quantity that  can be issued , and force doctors and their staff to  stay with a range of face losing their license,  We need more drug treatment facilities, more money needs to set aside for training of mental health and addiction workers. There needs to have more safe places for addicts released from shelters to go so they are not exposed to exist same  living arrangement even people that enabled them or forced addiction on them.  I think Narcam is good as a way to pull an overdose victim back from the edge, however, its very existence has lead to exploitation of that option.  In some instances Narcam relieves the victim of personal responsibility.  The fact is that some  surburban kids may have to face the same life behind bars that inner-city youth have been forced to face.","Maryland must raise its minimum wage to a much more liveable $15 per hour.  Maryland is one of the most expensive states to live in in the country, and has five of the ten most expensive communities, yet we propose giving a $1.4 billion dollar incentive to attract Amazon to what is the state's most costly counties.   Here is an example of just one of the problems.  Many seniors, especially those who are single do not earn enough income to live soley on Social Security and what may be a modest pension, so many have turned to substitute teaching to supplement their income.  Presently Baltimore County which pays its substitute teachers, the people for safeguarding  20 -30 children each day), a mere $91 per day, which shamefully is the third or fourth lowest substitute teachers per diem rate in the country,  barely about Mississippi and Louisiana.  (Again, Maryland is a state with the third highest cost of living.)  Nearly all Baltimore County subs now  have one or more college degrees, frequently more than the regular teacher.   The average sub rate in the United States is about $125 per day, and  the highest substitute teacher pe diem is being  $170 per day.  In addition, we must end income inequality not just between men and women,  but also between white women  (make $.82 of the dollar a white man makes) and African American women (make $.58 of the dollar a white man makes).  A rising tide must lift all.","The current Public Information Act Law  and open meetings law do not go nearly as far as they should in guaranteeing citizens speedy access to requested records, records that are now entered on computers in a matter of minutes, if not seconds, yet the law  still enforces allowable wait periods for a response that were put into place thirty years ago..  In other words,  COMAR has not kept pace with current technology.  In addition, the fees  that are  applied impose reproductions costs that are no longer  reflective of the actual cost of  reproduction or electronic submission, both of which have gone down as technology advances.  The open meetings laws are even antiquated.  They do  not specifically state what remedy should be imposed should the law be violated.  Who is supposed to intevene?  The law implies the Consumer Protection Division of the A.G. Office , however, when contaced that staff  repeats that's not their job.  The A.G.'s Office has stated in the past that meetings can be closed to conduct personnel matters.  In some case the election of new  officers,  the review and approval of Homeowner / Condo Association Budgets, even the awarding of contracts to o utside management companies  of a third to one half of an organization's budget, has all also taken  place in closed sessions without the knowlege or consent of Homewowners  or organization members.  Consumers who complain are told be the A.G.'s Consumer protection agency that there is nothing that can be done about the matter.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

Smith School of Business, University of Maryland Master of Public Administration, University of Delaware Bachelor of Science, Towson University","CEO of Timbre Technologies.  Entrepreneur and a business professor (Smith School of Business at UMD).  Started five companies throughout career.  Formerly  a member of the Harford County Council, Maryland Deputy Secretary of Health under Governor Hogan, Chairman of the Harford County Republican Party, and Vice Chair of the State Republican Party.","I support measures to create greater accountability for school administrators.  There are major issues related to how our school systems, and particularly Baltimore County, spend billions of taxpayer dollars.  Simply putting billions more into our schools without increasing accountability would be highly irresponsible.",I believe that the state has adequate resources to meet its transportation needs.  The state is properly funding roads and should continue to prioritize road improvement and construction needs.  Transit should be made to collect a higher percentage of its costs from fare box recovery.   I will oppose any attempts to increase taxes.,"I do not support the legalization of recreational marijuana, but I do support medical marijuana.",Maryland should continue to focus on improving the health of the Chesapeake Bay by prioritizing efforts that are fully grounded in science.  I will also support Governor Hogan's policy of funding the Chesapeake and Atlantic Coastal Bays Trust Fund.  It is also vitally important that the state assist homeowners on septic systems rather than place highly burdensome taxes on them.,"As Deputy Secretary of the Maryland Department of Health under Governor Hogan, I saw first hand just how unsustainable our current system really is.  Premiums in the individual market, facilitated by the Maryland Health Benefits Exchange, must be stabilized.  The recent efforts to create reinsurance for this market are only a short-term solution.  The key is to lower the cost of health care.    There is a lot of focus on the insurance side of health care, but rarely do efforts to lower actual costs of health care take a front seat.  I am also a big believer in incentivizing physicians to keep patients healthy, rather than simply paying them more to treat sick patients.  For instance, concierge physician practices see fewer patients, but are able to keep their patients healthier.  This lowers the overall costs to treat patients.  Government needs to get much more creative if we are ever going to have a sustainable system.","Maryland needs to crack down on violent crime in Baltimore.  Many criminals are given light sentences or released directly back onto the street.  This catch and release policy that is effectively created by Baltimore's judiciary is highly counterproductive to truly fighting crime.  Additionally, citizens in Baltimore's poorest communities need to be given a path that allows them to escape poverty.  The best way to do this is to create a business environment that is conducive to job creation.","As a business owner, I can say firsthand that Governor Hogan has vastly improved Maryland's business climate.  Regulations need to continue to be cut and taxes need to be lowered.  I also believe that there are not enough  business owners in Annapolis and the consequences are dire.  This General Assembly is very quick to pass laws that are extremely burdensome to small businesses.  In fact, many businesses operate on a very tight margin.  When the government creates expensive new mandates (e.g. sick leave requirements, or much higher minimum wages) business owners are forced to make decisions that often hurt employees.  In order to create more family-supporting jobs, the state needs to stop burdening our business owners with ever higher taxes and mandates.     The state tries to incentivize business creation, but usually goes about it the wrong way.  The laws of unintended consequences usually backfire on the folks in Annapolis.  I intend to champion small business owners and innovative entrepreneurs to help create an environment that helps them get the private funding and support they need to be successful.","Yes.  The current system of allowing partisan gerrymandering does a major disservice to Maryland's citizens.  As an example, the 7th District spans from Norrisville to Middle River.  This was done deliberately to pack as many Republicans into this district as possible so that more districts could have a Democratic majority.  This was pure politics and didn't consider the needs of our citizens.","The Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights (LEOBOR)  is vital to allowing police to do their job and it should not be weakened.  Public opinion has swung widely to be mostly anti-law enforcement and many politicians have jumped on the anti-policy bandwagon.  The General Assembly has considered many ways to make LEOBOR easier for good police officers to be punished.    However, I truly believe that any law enforcement officer who violates the law should be punished just like any other citizen.  There is no place for dirty cops in our state.","I support efforts to deal with the opioid crisis by educating young people, treating addiction, and ramping up enforcement of drug laws to remove drugs and dealers from our streets.  We truly need to increase the number of beds in the state not just for drug treatment, but for mental illness as well.  Community outpatient treatment also needs to be prioritized and I will support funds for every county and Baltimore City.","The General Assembly needs to be more conscious about supporting the business community in our state.  I believe that the path out of poverty lies in the ability of our citizens to get family-supporting jobs.  I also believe that entrepreneurship is a viable path for many to increase their income.  Additionally, the low quality of education in many of the state's low-income areas, and especially Baltimore City, serves to keep many in poverty for generations.  Frankly, we have a crisis on our hands since Baltimore City has schools that have 0 students passing basic tests.  These schools have completely failed.  Unfortunately, the teachers' unions in the state fight any effort to increase accountability or allow parents the choice to send their children to private school.  I believe that parents with students in failing schools should be allowed to send their children to a private school with public voucher money.  The fact that the unions oppose this shows just how self-serving they are and that they don't really care about the outcomes for our children.  This is unbelievably sad and income inequality will never be properly addressed until n not change until changes.","I believe that the Public Information Act is strong, but that government officials need to be made to respond more quickly.  Additionally, the open meetings law is routinely circumvented because there are rarely any legal repercussions on officials who violate this law.  I would support strengthening the state's open meeting laws.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

Local 7 at Camden Yards,"I do support the finding to the commission and would be committed to funding the reforms with the money we already have first, the current administration has become way too generous in giving public funds to private schools. When our teachers and public schools are being underfunded and do not have access to the resources needed for both teachers and students alike I think we need to reevaluate where we are sending public money. Secondly we need to continue to ensure money intended for education is locked in the education budget, I would be in favor of legalizing sports betting in Maryland with all tax revenue going to our public schools, and unlike with what happened with the casino money it will be done correctly.","The Governor's decision not to approve the Red Line was a huge mistake for the future of Baltimore and Maryland. Transportation is at the top of the list when businesses look to relocate or expand to other cities. Amazon's decision not to choose Baltimore was widely based on our lack of transportation options and the systems inefficiency. I would be in favor of a line that would connect both sides of Baltimore County and Baltimore City. The new bus system has been a disaster according to daily commuters who I have spoken to, many saying their trip times have increased. Improving transportation options and systems in the Baltimore metro-area would be my top legislative priority in regards to transportation, it is important that this problem is resolved sooner rather than later if we want the Baltimore area to appeal to businesses. Transportation will be a key piece to bringing employment back to the area. I would also be in favor of investing in a high-speed rail that would connect Baltimore-Washington, D.C. and beyond. By creating a high speed rail we would be cutting commuters trip to the two cities while also lowering our carbon emissions.","I would vote in favor of a bill legalizing recreational marijuana in Maryland. While I do not encourage drug use of any kind I do not see marijuana as being any more harmful than alcohol, cigarettes, or other harmful tobacco products that are legally accessible to the public. Law enforcement officials and residents alike I have spoken to believe it is time to clear our criminal justice system of marijuana related cases, especially at a time when much harder and more dangerous drugs like heroin and opioids are killing over a thousand of our fellow citizens a year. Law enforcement efforts should be diverted to targeting opioid dealers and violent criminals.","We have come far as a state over the last few decades but there is still much work to be done. With the Trump Administration's decision to cut nearly 90% of federal Chesapeake Bay cleanup funding Maryland must come up with the funding to continue to restore and protect the progress we have already made in protecting the Bay. Among holding corporate polluters accountable I would like Maryland to enforce a statewide ban on plastic bags and Styrofoam containers/cups. Another environmental challenge facing our state is deforestation and overdevelopment which attributes to runoff, we must more responsibly and carefully manage development in the state especially of areas within the Chesapeake Bay watershed.","Healthcare is one of the top issues voters would like to see addressed. With many Marylanders premiums skyrocketing up to 100% and the Affordable Care Act under attack, now more than ever Maryland needs to offer healthcare security for its citizens. If it can in fact be funded and sustained I would be in favor of a state-funded Medicare for all system. That would still take some time to implement if passed. In the meantime I am in favor of a reinsurance program. Under a reinsurance program that state would pick up costs of many of the high risk enrollees who are currently flooding the marketplace resulting in skyrocketing premiums on the lower risk customers. The biggest issue is the Trump Administration repealing the individual mandate. It is keeping many low-risk customers from voluntarily entering the marketplace. So the main goal of the state would have to be encouraging greater, more diverse enrollment into the market.","I believe the state has an integral role in assisting Baltimore City address the violent crime that has plagued the city for decades costing thousands of lives. The state should continue to offer resources to law enforcement and hold repeat violent offenders accountable. Establishing healthier police-community relations is also key to ending violent crime, citizens are the eyes and ears of neighborhoods. The more trust between law enforcement and citizens the less power violent criminals have over communities. The state should offer funding to hold seminars for officers on how to best build relations with the community and also hold annual meet and greets in partnership with state and city officials to introduce police and the people they serve. Another approach is to invest in more programs that protect our youth from the streets and set them on a straight path forward through mentors, sports, and other extracurricular activities. Offering state funding to the city's YouthWorks program which connects Baltimore's youth to summer jobs would be another way to keep them off the streets. We as a city and state must do more than just ""cleaning the streets"" the problem lies deeper than that and until we get to the root problems that allow violent crime to flourish it will be sure to continue.","Maryland has a healthy business climate but we can do better. We need to ensure that we are making the proper investments for our future by investing in areas such as transportation and infrastructure, particularly in the Baltimore metropolitan region. The first thing large employers look for when relocating or expanding is a state or cities transit system, this is an area we must improve especially if we want to remain competitive with our neighbors in Virginia. My top legislative priority in reference to jobs would be introducing legislation that would make private companies that receive tax breaks from the state be required to agree to a Labor Peace Agreement. Such legislation would give employees an opportunity to unionize should they vote to do so.  Tax breaks can be useful in terms of competing with other states but they too often benefit the companies and CEO's than they do workers. This legislation would ensure working families higher wages and benefits.","Yes, Maryland voters should have a fair opportunity to elect the candidates they wish to serve them not the other way around, for too long elected officials have chosen their voters through the process of gerrymandering. In a democratic society I find that to be unacceptable. If elected I would support and vote for legislation that would reform our current redistricting policies and put the power of elections in the hands of voters, not politicians.",At the current time I would not be in favor of changing the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights though I would be open to further reviewing the matter as a legislator.,"The biggest healthcare issue facing our state is without a doubt addiction and the opioid crisis. Having lost my father a little over a year ago to his battle with addiction this is an issue that has been the center of my campaign and the reason I am running.  If elected I would introduce legislation that would require additional oversight over pharmaceutical & medical industries, implementing tighter regulations over opioid manufacturers and distributors, who often push and bribe doctors to prescribe their product, under such legislation these companies will be held accountable. I would also advocate the state sue any pharmaceutical companies involved in deceptive marketing practices and hold them liable for the costs incurred by the state relating the epidemic.  Finally we must offer more individualized treatment for addicts by abandoning the one size fits all approach and offering services that apply to the individual by integrating substance use treatment into primary care. I would also push to establish state funded residential treatment centers that include outpatient as well as inpatient services.",It is no secret as CEO's wages have increased dramatically for the few decades average workers wages have remained almost stagnant. This is why I am in favor of a $15 minimum wage for the state of Maryland with protections for our local small businesses.,Without transparency in government there is no democracy. I do not believe Maryland's Public Information Act and open meeting laws are adequate enough. Some departments and areas are government are better than others in providing information but others not so much particularly from the criminal justice  system. It should not be a hurdle for the press and concerned citizens to have access to public information of any kind. As a state we must prioritize expanding transparency and accessibility of government functions and records.,"Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

I am also committed to funding those reforms. One of the biggest things that the commission recommends is an update to our education funding formula. We need to spend more money on at-risk children before they fall behind. That means we must give additional funding to schools in certain areas before the test scores fall.,No. The state needs to spend more money on transit. I was quite disappointed in the cancellation of the Red Line here in Baltimore. Even with the BaltimoreLink bus system Baltimore still has gaps. The Red Line would have opened up job opportunities in areas where there's no significant mass transit available.,Yes. I support not only the legalization of marijuana in addition to Maryland having dispensaries.,Maryland should continue to work with neighboring states to help stop run-off pollution and dumping as well as to monitor our crab and fish population to possibly shorten the season if there is possible overfishing.,Maryland should provide each county health departments more money to provide mobile health services. When I went to Iowa I saw that their state has mobile health vans outside of nightclubs that provide free rapid HIV and STD testing and the results were available in minutes.  I think it would be great if Maryland had a similar program as well as mobile wellness checkups available at malls and high traffic areas.,The state should help enforce the consent decree as well as give additional funding to crime-prevention programs. Maryland should also give the city more funding to help police officers with de-escalation training.,With Baltimore being the biggest city in Maryland it is clear to me that the lack of adequate transportation options has hurt business growth in Maryland. This is why the Red Line was so important. Companies want to be where their employees can access them from public transportation. This is why Baltimore's bid was rejected by Amazon but Montgomery County's bid is a finalist. Montgomery County has multiple railways of accessibility yet the biggest city in Maryland does not. There is a lack of job equality throughout the state.,Yes. I also would support computer drawn districts so that there is no political influence in the legislative maps.,The Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights initially protected police officers from people higher up in the police department but today it serves to protect police officers from the public. I welcome the changes that have been made recently so that more information is public regarding complaints.,"I would have people treated for rehabilitation in jail. Currently those addicted to drugs are stabilized or treated for their addiction but are not given the necessary tools to stay clean once they are released. This, therefore, causes a repeating cycle.",The state should expand pay discrimination laws as well as eliminate any laws that allow mentally challenged individuals to receive the normal minimum wage.,No. The best example is the survellience of the Mondawmin Mall area during the Baltimore riots.

I am currently the owner of a small specialty cut flower business.","The preliminary report of the Kirwin Commission indicates that in order for Maryland to be competitive nationally and internationally reforms to our education system are necessary.   The fact that Maryland schools have gone from being ranked first in the nation to sixth reaffirms that reforms are needed.  I support the preliminary recommendations of the Kirwin Commission.  Approval by Marylanders of the constitutional amendment to use casino funds for education is the first step toward funding these much-needed reforms. Our public schools must be strengthened so that all of our children become problem solvers, innovators and critical thinkers.  We have an obligation to provide the foundation and framework so that all children have the opportunity to excel and reach their full potential.","A reliable and efficient transportation system is necessary for economic growth, equal opportunity and quality of life.  Funding to maintain and build additional public transit must be a priority to ensure affordable and reliable access to jobs and to reduce carbon emissions.  Our region is not adequately served by public transportation and we need to continue to seek innovative ways to fund an expansion of public transportation.","I support the decriminalization of marijuana and believe we should evaluate the feasibility of expunging past convictions.  Given recreational marijuana has been made legal only in the past few years in a few states, it seems prudent to evaluate the effects legalization has had on these states  before making a decision for Maryland.  From what I have seen, the data on the impact is inconclusive.",We have made headway in improving the health of the Chesapeake Bay and we must not slip backwards.  We need to return to a smart growth approach to development and continue to invest in science to study and find solutions to restore the bay.  The state needs to adopt policies that protect our most important forests and that reduces impervious surfaces that create runoff.  It is imperative that we work with surrounding states to find and fund regional solutions.  The Chesapeake Bay is one of our greatest assets and we must restore and protect it particularly in light of the Federal government's actions relative to environmental issues.,"We need to ensure good, affordable health care is accessible to everyone giving us all the opportunity to live healthy, active and independent lives at every stage.  Given the situation with federal health care policy Maryland must be a leader and continue to move forward with the work done to provide affordable health insurance options and to control rising prescription costs.  Aging, economic disparities, changes in the work environment and increasing costs have left many people to choose between medical care and other necessities.  We are better than this and must continue as a state to work for affordable healthcare for all.","It is the state's responsibility to be an active partner with the city in addressing violent crime in Baltimore.  The state needs to provide resources to aid in identifying and correcting root causes.  Education, affordable housing, job opportunities, health care, substance abuse care, transportation options – these all impact the community.  Residents of Baltimore City are also citizens of Maryland and it is the responsibility of the state to create a strong economy that will provide economic opportunity to all citizens of the state.","To attract businesses to Maryland that pay good wages and provide good benefits, Maryland must offer a trained and educated workforce, a reliable and efficient transportation system, affordable housing near jobs and ensure regulations are reasonable and can be readily complied with.  Policies that support working families such as sick leave and an increased minimum wage should be adopted with a reasonable time-frame for implementation. People should not have to work multiple low wage jobs to support their families.  Partnerships and collaboration between schools, colleges, vocational training centers, and businesses to ensure students are prepared for available jobs will benefit both the student and the business.",The challenge of fair districts extends well beyond Maryland.  Nationwide districts have not been drawn to ensure that every person's vote counts.  It is critical to America that redistricting be done across the country following the census based on common sense boundaries and designed so that all citizens are represented equitably.,"Transparency and ethics at all levels of government is paramount.  All government employees and officials at every level must be held to the highest standards.  All people have the right to constitutional due process and we must ensure that policy is not only in place but is equitably applied so that both police and the public are protected.  Given some of the issues that have come to light recently it is critical that we review and update policies.  We need to focus on community policing, use of de-escalation techniques and training to reduce conflicts.","Addiction to opioids and other substances is destroying families and robbing children of the promise of a future that will allow them to reach their full potential.  We must invest in prevention and treatment programs throughout the State so that treatment is available regardless of what county or city you live in.  The effects of opiate withdrawal do not disappear during a 3-day detox period so long-term follow-up and care is needed to help people successfully re-enter their daily life and the work force.  We need more early intervention, more beds and more long-term support.","There are many actions necessary to address Income inequality.  We must ensure our public schools are removing barriers to learning and educating our young people so they are prepared for the jobs of the future.  We need to support our community colleges that provide re-training when workforce demand changes.  Higher education and training must be affordable and within reach of all.  Social services and programs that provide a safety net for working mothers, single parents and all working families is crucial. Criminal justice reform is necessary so that people are able to re-enter the workforce after incarceration to support themselves and their families and to ensure people are not incarcerated when there are other alternatives for rehabilitation that will allow them to continue to support themselves and their families.   Discrimination against any person relative to education, housing, the workplace, medical services, banking or the legal system prevents our society from being its best and cannot be tolerated.  We must ensure policies already in place are enforced consistently and work together to strengthen policies shown to be ineffective and to identify new policies to fill gaps.","Transparency and holding government officials accountable to the highest ethical standards is crucial for a society to thrive.  The state's Public Information Act and open meetings laws are somewhat effective in safeguarding the public's ability to monitor the government.  However, to be the most effective, swift and real actions must be taken when the PIA and open meetings regulations are violated.   Educating citizens about the PIA and open meetings requirements should be done during the voting process or at the points a citizen interacts with government.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

Hoyer Early Childhood Learning Center (Cheverly) Gladys Noon Spellman (Cheverly) Robert Goddard Montessori (Seabrook) Eleanor Roosevelt High (Greenbelt) University of Maryland (College Park),"Automobile marketing  Theatre - Broadway credited Actor, Assistant play director.  Real estate community liaison","I support the Commission's findings. I think the state should 1) increase funding for schools with more poor and special needs children, 2) that pre-k should be expanded, 3) that the status of educators should be raised, 4) that high school diplomas should be made more meaningful and valuable, and 5) that Maryland schools -- especially Prince George's County schools -- desperately need better governance and more accountability. Specifically, for educators, I support higher quality preparation programs, higher certification requirements, higher pay, more time for teamwork and individual attention, career ladders that reward teacher expertise, and leadership development. And, to make high school diplomas more valuable, I support college and career readiness by the end of tenth grade, an early warning system, targeted courses for special needs students, AP and IB courses, opportunities for advanced high school students to earn associates' degrees, and technical education that leads to the latest industry certified credentials.  I am committed to funding these reforms by making wealthy individuals and corporations pay their fair share in taxes.","Maryland's transportation spending is out of whack. I support more investment in mass public transit infrastructure and Metro funding, but, in my view, the state has been too focused on spending on things like the governor's proposed highway expansion project, which, by the way, was characterized by cronyism and a lack of ethics and transparency, because his transportation secretary supported giving a fast-tracked contract worth tens of millions of dollars to his former employer, a friend, and a former colleague. The Red Line cancellation was bad for Baltimore in terms of economic development and growth, jobs, job access, health care, child care, and educational opportunities, and it made it harder for Baltimore County residents to get to federal agencies like Social Security and Medicare offices. Without the Red Line and Baltimore Link, Baltimore transit is severely lacking, and it's too slow.","I support legalizing recreational marijuana. It's overdue, and the state should have legalized it years ago. I think mere legalization of marijuana was only intended to help a select few make exorbitant profits off of pot, while others have gone to jail over pot. On that point, I support the retroactive expungement of the so called criminal records of those Marylanders who have been jailed for breaking draconian drug laws like marijuana criminalization.","The Chesapeake Bay is too dirty, and, in my view, it will not be clean enough until it is clean enough for people to swim in. As unconventional as that may sound, that is my standard. The state needs to invest more resources into the protection of crabs and other wildlife while eliminating pollution.","First, I believe that high quality health care is a right. That is the foundation of my health care policy platform, which is that I support universal health care -- a Medicare for all single payer system. I support the state investing the necessary resources to make this vision a reality. And I support legislation to lower costs and prices for prescription drug medications","Baltimore's violent crime rate is way too high. In short, my solution is fourfold. First, I believe in community policing strategies. Second, get illegally obtained firearms off the streets. Third, expand the Safe Streets program. Fourth, embrace external partnerships like gun task forces that span Maryland cities and counties. These partnerships recognize the importance of collaboration between communities like Baltimore and those in District 47a. While violent crime may be lower in 47a, the crime rate here also needs to be lowered. And working together to address this local and even national issue of guns is a major key.","My focus is not on giveaways to large corporations. My focus is on creating jobs that can help ordinary workers support their families, and I support job training and retraining for jobs in 21st century industries -- high tech jobs and clean energy jobs. Second, I support an expansion of the Maryland earned income tax credit. And, third, I will especially support legislation that uplifts small-, local-, minority-, or women-owned businesses.","I oppose gerrymandering. Gerrymandering is unfair, and it should be a bipartisan issue: Democrats and Republicans should unite to end gerrymandering. It undermines free speech, and dilutes Americans' voting power through inequality. Ending gerrymandering is a matter of strengthening our nation's democracy.","I am open to the option of amending the LEOBR. Police are not above the law. There have been to many police shootings and killings of civilians. Police in the U.S. should consider the example of armed soldiers who, while in foreign territory, routinely encounter civilians that otherwise may appear ""threatening."" But, to their credit, our soldiers generally demonstrate an impressive level of restraint, even in wartime. Police need to show more restraint with and have less fear of the public. I respect officers' rights to due process and know how concerned police are about being able to come home every evening. But ordinary Americans, including African-Americans, too should be able to come home alive and come home safely.","The opioid issue is at a crisis point in Maryland, as it is in too many places across the country. I believe the answer is twofold: first, crack down on reckless drug manufacturers. Second, promote restorative justice: initiatives and programs opioid users that are addicted. But restorative justice is bigger and broader than opioids. It also should apply to drug addicts that have abused crack and heroin -- addicts who may tend to be racial minorities, compared to opioid abusers.","I support a livable wage: of course, first, that means support for the Fight for 15. But, in the long run, we need to think bigger and bolder than that, because we need to account for inflation and be realistic about the cost of living, especially in more expensive Maryland communities near the Capital Beltway. I am also a strong supporter of workers and union issues. I support strengthening laws on equal pay for women. I think that governments at all levels need to be making sure tax dollars are promoting antipoverty programs. And I think that millionaires and billionaires need to pay their fair share in taxes.","The state's public information and open meetings laws are weak and do too little to promote open government. State agencies take too long to respond to Public Information Act requests from journalists and Maryland taxpayers. They charge exorbitant fees. They over-redact. And they deny, deny, deny, banking on requesters' inability and unwillingness to sue. And too many ordinary Maryland taxpayers are frustrated with the rate at which public bodies find ways to legally hold secret meetings to discuss the business of the people. These laws need to be strengthened in favor of the public's right to know, not in favor of government officials' right to hide.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

Let's begin to address all substance abuse in early education and we will begin to curtail the social ill of substance abuse of all portions.","We have taken steps to address the notion of pay disparity. While we have worked diligently over the last four years to address this amongst our state agencies, we must also address the private section which does business with our state. We must also ensure that our eligibility pool grows with the enhancement and accountability of our public school system to produce highly educated graduates.","I think the Public Information Act and Open Meetings laws adequately ensure Marylanders' ability to execise oversight of their goverment.

Point sources include sewage treatment plants, stormwater discharges, industrial discharges, etc. Nonpoint sources include pollutants carried by rainfall runoff from forests, agricultural lands, atmospheric deposition, abandoned land mines, etc.  TMDL = Wasteload Allocation + Load Allocation + Margin of Safety  The Chesapeake Bay TMDL is unique because of the extensive measures EPA and the jurisdictions adopted to ensure accountability for reducing pollution and meeting target progress dates. The TMDL will be implemented using an accountability framework that guides restoration efforts using four elements.  These elements include Watershed Implementation Plans (WIPs), two-year milestones, EPA's tracking and assessment of restoration progress and specific federal actions if jurisdictions do not meet their commitments.

Having worked for large corporations, nonprofits, state government, and as a business owner, I understand the economic drivers and workplace realities that promote or impede financial growth, employment, and fair labor practices.  Working for the Maryland Judiciary, I created the first adult guardianship oversight program to help protect vulnerable senior citizens and disabled adults. I also serve on the Anne Arundel County Adult Public Guardianship Review Board. I am committed to ensuring that our aging population has the services and resources to live healthy, independent lives as long as possible.  Through my work with a nonprofit organization dedicated to reducing substance misuse, I see firsthand the devastating consequences of the opioid epidemic. Increasing prevention programs and eliminating the barriers for widespread, affordable treatment are among my top priorities in addressing this crisis.   Equal opportunities in the workplace and affordable childcare are critical to strengthening Maryland families. As past chair of the Anne Arundel County Commission for Women and current board member of the Maryland Legislative Agenda For Women, I know the work that needs to be done to overcome the challenges facing women of all ages.  I live in the Broadneck Peninsula with my husband, a Navy veteran, and our son and daughter, both of whom attend public schools. I've taught at many of our schools as a substitute teacher. Our classrooms are overcrowded with underpaid and overworked teachers and our kids are paying the price. It's time to make education a priority and reinvest in our youth.  A graduate of Leadership Anne Arundel's Neighborhood Leadership Academy and a graduate of Emerge Maryland, a program that trains women to run for office, I am well prepared for this campaign and serve the people of District 33.","Yes, the preliminary findings of the Commission are troubling. Academic achievement among Maryland students is declining in relation to the rest of the country and the world. On the positive side, the Commission stated that reversing this course is ""an achievable goal provided Maryland makes a sustained, statewide commitment to systemic change."" I agree with the recommendations identified in the report and support increased funding to implement these recommendations. I am in support of the Fix the Fund Act, and hope that voters will decide casino money must go directly to schools, above and beyond funding through the state's General Fund. This, along with Commission's recommendations for a new funding formula will be a starting point for discussion about how to pay for these recommendations.","No. We have too many cars on the road and inadequate public transportation.  Safe, efficient and effective transportation systems are essential for Maryland's economic competitiveness. Maryland has the second longest commuting time in the country. As I live near the Bay Bridge, traffic congestion is  an important issue for people in my district. Maryland needs  more accessible and reliable transportation options for both our rural and urban communities. Our neighboring states are implementing transit programs that reduce congestion and improve economic development in their communities. I support transportation policies that focus on getting citizens greater access to rapid transit so less cars are on the road.","Many people still believe that recreational marijuana is simply legalizing medical marijuana. Medical and recreational marijuana are completely different. Medical marijuana has high concentrations of CBD which has therapeutic properties with very low or no TCH which is the psychoactive ingredient that gets you high. In recreational marijuana, the CBD and THC concentration is reversed.  Legalizing a drug with high concentrations of THC is what has people worried. Recent scientific data citing the detrimental long term effects of marijuana on the developing brain is alarming. A recent NPR article pointed out that marijuana arrest rate for white youths while it increased for arrest rates for Latino and black youths. Furthermore, legalization impacts all kinds of laws such as school safety policies, divorce and child custody, child abuse and neglect, child care regulation, advertising, substance abuse programs, employment law, gun laws, traffic offenses and more.  Also what happens to the revenue?  Would we lock box it for education, the environment or would it go into the general fund?  Lots of things to be considered. This is a very complex issue and I want more data, more facts and more of a plan before I'm convinced that this is good for Maryland.  For now I will work to advocate for laws that prohibit employers from discriminating against people who use medical marijuana, expand existing decriminalization laws by increasing the amount a person can possess without a presumption of ""intent to distribute,"" and systematic expungement of qualifying convictions.","Continue to push for bipartisan efforts to fund programs that protect the Bay at the local, state and federal level. Focus the message on economic growth and educate lawmakers and citizens how vital the Chesapeake by is to our economy to get buy-in. Continue working with our local and regional partners on the ""pollution diet"" and other initiatives. Controlling development and making poultry growers responsible for removing chicken litter are also important steps to a healthy bay.","Stabilizing Maryland's Health Benefit Exchange Program to ensure its sustainability is vital to ensuring high quality, affordable healthcare.  Recent legislation requiring the State to apply for an ""innovation waiver"" to pave the way for a reinsurance program to reduce expected premium hikes is a step towards stabilization.  Patient-centered, consumer-driven programs can also play a large role in both reducing costs and improving healthcare outcomes. Costs for procedures, prescription drugs, diagnostic testing, and doctor visits can vary dramatically.  Knowing whether or not a physician is getting a bonus for prescribing a certain drug would also be helpful. Requiring more transparency on these costs and offering alternatives to consumers can increase competition which drives costs down. Offering people incentives to participate more fully in managing their own healthcare, such as tracking changes in their weight, blood pressure, and cholesterol can also help reduce costs and improve outcomes.","Investing in Baltimore's public schools and creating job opportunities for the nearly 25% of the population who live in poverty is critical to reducing crime. As Baltimore author Kevin Shird wrote in a recent opinion for The Hill, ""Violence is a symptom of poverty, not a cause""    Additionally, the city needs more resources to crack down on the illegal drug trade which accounts for much of the violence. Passing sensible gun laws that protect our youth and families, and better treatment programs to handle the opioid crisis will also help reduce the violence.","Maryland needs to increase efforts to foster new industries that create good paying jobs. The clean energy industry, including everything from wind turbines and solar panels, to home energy storage and energy efficiency, is exploding around the country and growing faster than any other industry. Employment for solar installers and wind turbine technicians is expected to roughly double in the next decade. A government-led effort to accelerate the potential of renewables would create good jobs.   It is also time for Maryland to invest in our infrastructure. Maryland was given a C- for infrastructure by the American Society of Civil Engineers.  A good infrastructure in the backbone of a healthy economy. It drives business by connecting workers to their jobs and creates opportunities for struggling communities. Putting people to work on our roads, railways, schools, parks, water and sewer mains and treatment plants,  and buildings throughout Maryland  is an investment that will boost our economy and repay us many times over in the years to come.",Yes,"Police have rights just like everyone else. However, during an investigation, police officers should not get special treatment that they themselves do not offer to suspects they are questioning. The Bill of Rights should be written to not give unfair advantage to officers.","Expanding prevention programs in K – 12 education by not only educating about the dangers of these drugs but also the misconceptions about addiction to reduce the stigma associated with this disease.  Work with physicians to establish statewide guidelines for prescribing opioids. Roughly fifty percent of all heroin addicts started with an opioid prescription to manage pain for an injury. Limiting prescriptions, using alternative methods for managing pain while not limiting their ability to treat patients who truly need these high powered pain killers.  Make long term treatment affordable and accessible with medically assisted treatment available to those who want it. Drugs like Suboxone, Vivitrol and Methadone have proved to be effective for many people therefore reducing the barriers make these drugs widely available is critical.   Having to wait for  treatment because a bed is not available is a huge problem. Maryland needs to think outside the box to  find  short term detox treatment facilities such as underutilized correctional facilities that can be converted to service this population.  Give the Attorney General's office more resources to fight this war by going after the pharmaceutical companies who mislead the public about the dangers of these drugs and go after the dealers who are putting these drugs on our streets. According to the Office of Attorney General a request for four additional positions, two in the Consumer Protection Division and two in the Criminal Division was denied by the Governor.","Immediate steps that should be taken are increasing the minimum wage, strengthening collective bargaining, enacting and enforcing fair labor laws, such as reasonable overtime rules, better paid sick and family leave, right to request a predictable schedule, and expanding access to affordable childcare. In the long term we need to create new jobs by investing in Maryland's infrastructure and our environment, and create a tax system that doesn't so heavily favor corporations at the expense of working families","Government transparency depends on the State's Public Information Act and open meetings act.  According to the recent report of The Attorney General on the Implementation of the Public Information Act, 2017 shows a need for improvement. I support the recommendations made by the Attorney General.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

,YES,state-house,23B,Paul Manicone,Manicone,02/28/1972,Upper Marlboro,Democratic,Prince George's County,http://www.paulmanicone.com,drpaulfordelegate,paulmaniconemd,http://surveygizmoresponseuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/fileuploads/296249/4297291/117-f9215ce349c87b60051c360d6f5c33e8_PM_Headshot_Photo_2015.png,M.D. Sackler School of Medicine 2001 B.A. New York University 1994,I am a board certified pediatrician and serve as the associate chief hospitalist at Children's National Medical Center in Washington DC,"I so support the findings of the CIEE. The Commission's report is well researched with national and international comparative metrics and goes to an exhaustive length to lay out the multifactorial dimensions to the educational performance in Maryland. I agree with the need for a long term investment akin to the focus that Massachusetts has made (and hopefully the results they have achieved). The Commission emphasizes the depth of this vision which extends for early childhood education all the way tot the college pathway for young educators. In their report, the Commission does not describe a sustainable funding strategy but clearly this needs to be a bipartisan supported endeavor at the county, state and federal level.  Education is the primary and most effective mechanism towards upward socioeconomic mobility and is the driver for Maryland's future.","Maryland's transportation is favored more heavily towards roads than public transit. That said, BaltimoreLink's efforts are important steps forward in terms of reliability and access. Bus-only lanes and traffic light sensors that extend green lights for them are important first steps (which have already shown a 9% increase in reliability), however this initiative needs ongoing performance evaluations and modifications with all key stakeholder having a voice, especially the riders! Transportation throughout Maryland will only become more challenging over the next decade and therefore I am interested in a long term infrastructure assessment and strategy to meet the growing demands and challenges.","As a pediatrician, I have personally cared for more children with accidental marijuana intoxication than I care to remember. Many small children have access to 'edibles' as they are often prepared in forms that are attractive to children such as cookies. Legalization for adults would make access immediate and affordable to many adolescents in middle and high school.  I do however support the controlled and diagnosis specific usage of medical marijuana.","As a Marylander and as a sailor, I am passionate about the restoration of the Chesapeake Bay and investment in the Chesapeake Bay Foundation.  Firstly, the Foundation must remain solvent and continue to do their important work.  Secondly, recreational boating and fishing are multi-billion dollar industries which is not only a strong economic engine for Maryland, it is a source of national pride. Furthermore as the largest fish estuary in the world, it is incumbent upon the state and federal governments to support the preservation of this natural wonder of the world.  Lastly, we must prevent offshore drilling as this is a clear and present danger to our environment and our boating and fishing economy.","As a physician, this is an area that I am very passionate about.  Watching the affordable care act nearly become undone without a viable alternative motivated me to run for public office. I simply could not stand by any longer when the coverage of hundreds of thousands of Marylanders, and millions of Americans would have been reduced to unregulated and inadequate coverage. Good evidence now exists that shows the economic benefits of expansion of Medicaid under the ACA. Maryland needs to focus on coverage, access and primary care incentives.  Incentives for utilization of primary care should include premium reductions for consumers. Prevention of complications of diabetes, heart disease, stroke and early detection of cancer will improve the lives of Marylanders and create long term savings.",The state should play a large and comprehensive role.  Baltimore has long been struggling with violent crime and I would be naïve to think I have a clear path forward. The state must remain partnered with the City of Baltimore to prioritize crime reduction.,"According to the US News and World Report, Maryland ranks #2 in the nation in ""Opportunity"" yet is ranks very average in the areas of 'fiscal stability', 'economic growth' and 'quality of life' .  This discrepancy illustrates a disconnect between our potential and our reality.  Maryland's business climate is in need of a stimulus. Maryland needs innovation and stability. This means we need to support businesses who are jobs creators in Maryland.  We also need to strengthen our labor unions who have steadily eroded over the last half century. Together these two forces will create synergy and stimulate our economy.",Absolutely. Gerrymandering is wrong and should be fair regardless of which party controls the General Assembly.,"Law enforcement is the toughest job on earth. It is even more difficult when there is public mistrust.  Herein lies the root of the issue.  Public mistrust. I support community policing efforts which strive to engage with community leaders, local business owners and places of worship to create a more forwardly engaging presence in the community rather than a more disconnected militarized approach to policing.","The opioid epidemic requires three major efforts: 1. Law enforcement to stem the flow of drugs on the street. 2. Addiction management for the tens of thousands of Marylanders who abuse opioids and struggle with addiction. 3. Medical community engagement. Physician groups, health care organizations and pharmaceutical companies need to participate in this effort to reduce the number of prescriptions of opiates that are excessive and unnecessary.",Education and job creation will reduce the inequality gap however the inequality that exists now based on gender or race is unacceptable and hazardous to our growth and prosperity. Diversity is a stimulus. History has proven this time and time again.  The state must continue to engage with residents and civic leaders to address this endemic issue that is both pervasive and harmful.,"I believe they could. The state could do more to active, educate and engage Marylanders in the civic affairs.  There are many venues for this and it is perhaps one of the most exciting aspects of our democracy.  I believe this for of oversight and access to our government creates more dialogue and more respect for both our residents and our legislators who at the end of the day, all want the same essential elements of life: happiness, good health and prosperity!","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

,YES,state-house,34B,Susan K. McComas,McComas,04/03/1951,Bel Air,Republican,Harford County,http://www.smccomas.com,susank.mccomas,,,"Johns Hopkins Univ.  Social and Behavioral Science; Univ. of Colorado, Public Adm.  graduate work College of Law, Univ. of Wyoming J.D.","Attorney at Law - licensed in Wyo. & Maryland  Susan K. McComas, P.A.","Yes, the academic success of Maryland students is not as good as it should be.  The formula for school funding is weighted to help the poorer jurisdictions with school funding so that all Maryland students receive a comparable education.  In reality that does not always work.  Each jurisdiction has unique assets and liabilities.  Funding reforms need to be fair, equitable, and flexible.  For too long the current formula has not been kind to Harford County, teachers, and students.  Compared to other states Maryland has a unique system which is extremely centralized.   Perhaps more local control and decision making might be something to review, analyze, and consider.  This would be a radical departure, but would allow each locality to have more control of over one half of each county's budget.  According to  one study there is a funding gap of $2 billion in state funding and $1 billion in local government spending.  Education is the biggest expenditure in the state and county budgets.  Perhaps more not less control is needed at the county levels.   Less state mandates and more local control might be just the ticket.  It was promised that the tax on the lottery was going to education, then it was promised that the tax from slots was going to education, and now it is a constitutional amendment that would state all casino tax revenues would go to education.  It would be a lock box until that box has to be raided which has happened in other states.","No.  Marylanders like their cars.  During the morning and evening rush hours it can take two hours to go only 60 miles.  As soon as a new lane is added to a road, it is filled with cars.  Harford County has several local buses and the train system that gets people to Baltimore and Washington, D.C.  This certainly works for government workers.  It does not work for people doing shift work, professionals that use their vehicles as part of their jobs, and people who have appointments in D.C. or Baltimore.  One size does not fit all of the transportation needs of the State of Maryland.  It is not fair or equitable that the less populated counties and municipalities should be short changed because they do not have the populations to deal with the unfairly balanced transportation scoring system adopted by the General Assembly.  There is an old saying  ""If it ain't broken, don't fix it.""  Well the Consolidated Transportation Plan was instituted under Governor Mandel, worked well with no scandals.  The only reason for change was to once again strip the Republican Governor and Executive Branch of power.","No.  I realize that the immediate benefits of taxing would help solve funding issues, but the tax money  does not outweigh the potential risks.  Without extensive and rigorous studies and research on the physical and mental health risks, the family, and societal impacts, Maryland would be wrong to approve the recreational use of marijuana.  And even more importantly, law enforcement does not have the technology to determine how to detect if a driver is impaired by marijuana without blood tests which can only be given in very limited circumstances.  I will not support legalization.   I have supported medical marijuana because there is quality control, medical supervision, and a state monitored growing, prescription, and distribution  system.  At this time, the federal government has not legalized its use which is a major concern of the banking and lending institutions.  There is also the issue of zoning of the stores and there is not a public demand for marijuana shops in the local neighborhood shopping centers.","The Chesapeake Bay is the destination of the Susquehanna River Basin which borders the large East Coast populations.  Maryland along with  New York and Pennsylvania are members of the Susquehanna River Basin Commission formed in 1970 where the states and federal government formed a compact to protect the river and its tributaries.  There needs to be regional incentives for the other states to work with Maryland to utilize the latest and best practices in farming, crop control, and animal husbandry.  Municipalities that border the river need to be encouraged to upgrade their water and sewer systems.   Maryland needs to engage public/private partnerships to continue to clean the bay and to promote oyster beds and natural grasses that can filter and clean the Bay waters.  Bay and conservation tourism needs to be promoted to inspire vacationers and students about the natural beauties and ecosystem of the Bay.   The state needs to be a partner and not an enemy of the crabbing and fishing industry.   I also think that riverboat gambling and reintroduction of the  Bay Steamers might be a great way to help fund Bay cleanup initiatives.","Maryland has the best medical facilities in the world.   Shock Trauma can literally bring injured victims back to life.  Now there needs to be more emphasis on preventive medicine, better nutrition, exercise, and lifestyle change.  Every jurisdiction has schools, churches, community centers that could be available for basic screenings on a regular basis that could educate citizens about  a possible problem, before there is the cardiac arrest.   Evidence based prevention programs could be a real game changer for more affordable health care.  We also need to take a very careful look at what are the drivers of medical care.  There also needs to be better public information regarding over the counter nutritional, drug, and other remedies.  A great deal of money is spent on these remedies and they may be doing more harm than good.","Baltimore needs to allow the state to provide assistance in the most violence and drug infested areas of the city.  The state needs to help the communities to trust the police.  The corruption of the Gun Trace Task Force has significantly upset relations between the community and police.   The community and school children need to know that police are there to help not hurt them.  The Governor's Office of Crime Control and Prevention has the ability to find the best experts to work on developing and improving trust between the police and community.  The Pal Centers need to be reopened for after school tutoring and sports activities.  The Maryland National Guard might be a great resource for a mentoring program for junior and high school students.   The legislature needs to pass legislation that puts violent criminals in prison for a long time.  Although the system needs diminution credits to manage the prison population, there is a small subset of violent criminals that only age, infirmity and prison can  protect the community.  Long prison terms must be available for the worst of the worst.","I think for the first time in many years there is hope and optimism.  Businesses see a Governor who cares about reducing taxes and fees and is working to expand economic opportunities for small and large businesses.  Maryland has some of the finest institutions and companies in the country.  But the problems in Baltimore City and the high murder rate are overshadowing all of our world class assets.  Telecommuting, company daycare centers, work flex hours, computerization of businesses are all helping to make Maryland more family friendly.  The state needs to create tax incentives that will promote good jobs without mandating  set hourly wages or benefits.   Starting businesses will not be able to handle government demands since they don't have the financial ability to do so.  The more established businesses will look for ways to increase automation to avoid the cost of labor.   The government needs to eliminate regulations and permitting that does nothing to protect the public and only hurts business.",Absolutely.  There is too much politics and backroom deals in the current system  The next Governor will draw the lines that will control the political future of Maryland for 10 to 12 years.  Only a non-partisan can remove the politics from this very politically charged once a decade event.,"The LEOBR was a studied, debated, and negotiated Bill of Rights developed in the 70s.  At this time the police are under tremendous assault from the press and the public.  It is dangerous and sometimes deadly job.  I live in a community that respects and trusts the police.  I know that this is not the case in other jurisdictions.  For the state to start making changes because Baltimore City has problems with the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights is not the answer.  Community policing and positive interaction with the citizenry is the best protection for the public and the police.  If it can be done without compromising the LEOBR than perhaps Baltimore City might need specific changes to fix their particular issues which are not borne out in the rest of the state","School children need to have age appropriate instruction about the dangers of  heroin and illegal drugs.  Proven best practices need to be employed by the medical and addictions community.  Drug dealers and drug kingpins must be held accountable for fatal overdoses.  It needs to be made very clear that once you try heroin, your first trip may be your last.   You will never have a better high than your first high.  You will never catch the dragon, but you will be a slave to this dragon for life.  An individual can be held in a medical facility if they are a danger to themselves or another.  I would offer that an individual who has overdosed is a danger to himself and  should be placed in a facility for a short period of time for medication, counseling, and addictions therapy with the goal of long term support, medication, and therapy.  The  police, fire, and emergency medical technicians can be the gatekeepers to the addict's recovery.  So when they take an overdose victim to the emergency room there needs to be more than just a social worker giving the person a list of resources.   There needs to be beds and places to put these individuals and preferably immediately.  Commitment laws need to be reviewed and revised to sidetrack addicts and redirect them into recovery.  The state and federal government can help with research, money, and manpower to help end this crisis.","The state should promote opportunity, fairness, transparency, and accountability.  The state should not be picking winners and losers.  The promise of a better tomorrow, a future, and hope is the best way to counter income inequality.  Taxing the rich and giving to the poor has not worked after fifty years of the Great Society so we should look to something else.  It is better to teach a man to fish than to give him a fish.  If he knows how to fish, he has a skill that will last a lifetime.  If he receives a fish, he is beholden to the person who gave him the fish and has lost some of his independence and freedom.","Yes, at this point there is a great deal of transparency within the legislative and executive branches of government.   There are tremendous amounts of information on the internet and in replays of public hearings online.   More importantly Maryland needs is an independent and diverse press and a strong vibrant two party system.  There does need to be more transparency in criminal sentencing particularly in Baltimore City.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

I regret that the Commission did not have broader representation including Republican delegates and more representatives of education reform.  The Commission has  unfortunately spent little time examining how our school systems could be better managed to accomplish more with existing resources.,My priority is roads.  90% of the money in the Transportation Trust Fund comes from taxes and fees on motorists while 59% of the money goes to mass transit.

Transit users should shoulder more of the cost of transit.,No.,"I think continuing progress on cleaning the Bay is the most important goal.

As someone who just exited the Maryland Education system and is unfamiliar with the Committee, I would have to do some research into their activities. I would happily fund reforms that I believe would be best suited for our current education system using my fresh experience.","On the state level, I believe that our spending is not balanced for both roads and transit. The state definitely has the budget to support both, it's just a matter of balancing the budget to allow more resourced to be allocated to our roads and transit.  In regards to Baltimore related issues, I'm unable to comment on anything as the city is outside of my district and I don't know the details.","Yes. I view this as a generation vs generation issue and not a party vs party issue.  I personally view marijuana in the same light as tobacco and alcohol when it comes to legalization. We can tax it, make jobs from it and save money in law enforcement. There's also the health concern to be noted. If we legalize marijuana, we'll know where it's grown and what is put into it.",Water quality in the Chesapeake Bay is my biggest concern on this topic. I would definitely push for legislation to improve our water quality and clarity.,I believe that our state should try and have a competitive market for health insurance to naturally drive prices down.,"I don't live in Baltimore or travel there often, but I definitely think the best role the state can play in improving the crime situation is to improve the job opportunities for city residents. If we can increase productivity and improve the job market in Baltimore, crime should decrease substantially.","I haven't viewed the statistics recently, but from the perspective of someone driving around and observing the area I would say that it's in a slump (at least in my district).

Voters should be very suspicious of any pol who does. Although the commission seems designed to justify a multi-billion state tax increase, the draft suggests it will also generate some useful insights. Sadly, it will also overlooking large problems with the status-quo.    One good idea- early childhood education is a wise investment, though it should be done in a manner that builds on successful institutions rather than adding a new pre-K grade level to an already failing school.   What is missing- the report won't address major problems in school governance we are seeing Baltimore County. We need an INDEPENDENT EXTERNAL AUDIT to reevaluate the hundreds of millions of dollars worth of tech contracts Dance signed.  We now KNOW these decisions were not entered into for the benefit of the children, and certainly not with regard to County taxpayers. My opponent Del. Lafferty killed this common sense bill (HB-428). There is a reason status-quo interests don't want people looking at these contracts- there are huge red flags with leasing laptops for $1200+, through a middleman.   The report won't address systemic failure in the City school system that fails underprivileged kids and drives middle class residents out of the city.  It doesn't appear to address issues of school environment, the deliberate elimination of disciplinary standards and mainstreaming chronically violent, disruptive students- there is no amount of money that can fix a policy that foolish.","I think the current balance is roughly appropriate and the state has adequate resources.  Although I support public transit, the Red Line was a poorly designed project justified by 40 year old assumptions.    High speed intercity rail has the potential to truly revolutionize Baltimore and should be a focus of transit policy for the region.","Yes.  I have two young children and certainly don't want them to become potheads. The current prohibition policy won't keep that from happening (if anything, it just creates a ""forbidden fruit"".  But I really don't want them facing prison or a criminal record because they made a mistake or hung out with the wrong crowd. Despite a trillion dollars and criminalizing millions of Americans for victimless crimes, prohibition has failed in reducing usage.  Prohibition is a battle against human nature. And the drug war is a war against US citizens, the costs of which fall disproportionately on the least advantaged members of society.  This has created injustices and reduced respect for the law.    Tax revenue from legalization should be directed to funding education and addiction treatment.","MD has a long history of environmental stewardship, driven by the wonderful resource of the Chesapeake Bay.  We need to continue making incremental progress.    I believe that major new policy initiatives should be subject to an enhanced cost-benefit analysis by a neutral body, most likely the Office of Legislative Services. This would allow legislators to focus policy on solutions that deliver the biggest bang for the buck.  Critics of cost/benefit analysis see it as a barrier to regulations, when it is really a way to prioritize resources on the best regulations.  For example, current policy focuses excessively on limiting development in rural areas served by septic systems which is a relatively minor source of run-off, while doing too little to address the major problem: manure produced by agriculture.","The core problem with America's health system is its superinflationary, out-of-control cost trajectory. The ACA did not do enough to address this core problem, while creating new problems. Unless you get a subsidy, the product offered by state exchanges costs far too much and then offers little coverage until meeting a huge deductible.   Pharma pricing scams, where profiteers use rigid FDA regulations to extract incredible price increases for established drugs or combinations of established drugs are another example of this problem. Although unfortunately a comprehensive solution requires federal action here too, state regulators should make every effort to drive these costs out of the system, and align incentives between providers and patients.    I support expanding managed care for high-cost populations in state-supported healthcare plans. This would reduce cost while providing a consistent standard of care for chronic problems like diabetes.  I also support innovative consumer options like allowing associations to offer insurance to members on terms similar to employer provided plans.","Baltimore City's violent crime problem is out-of-control, with a murder rate over 10 times the County.  The state needs to help fund the cost of addressing the City's violent crime problem. There is no silver bullet, though policy response should include  1) stronger penalties for violent gun crimes,  2) community interventions to deescalate violence (like counseling gun-shot victims in the hospital before they seek revenge) and  3) ending a failed policy of coddling violent, anti-social behavior in public schools.   One overlooked factor contributing to escalating violence is a lack of school discipline. Many victims and perpetrators of gun violence are tragically young.   Since 2011, Baltimore City Schools have been deliberately reducing disciplinary consequences for violent and chronically disruptive students, with the goal of eliminating out-of-school suspension. The advocates of this policy claim that school suspension created a ""school to prison"" pipeline. They are completely wrong- teaching kids that there is no real consequence for violent, anti-social behavior encourages violence and victimization. This policy was imposed based on a false premise- that discrimination is to blame anytime there is a disparate outcome in discipline for different racial groups.  The advocates foolishly believe that by eliminating discipline, they are eliminating discrimination.  The sad truth is this policy harms everyone, ignoring the rights of victims while sending kids with behavioral problems on an actual school-to-prison pipeline. But it disproportionately harms poor, minority kids in tough neighborhoods.","MD's business climate is mediocre, though certainly better thanks to Governor Hogan. O'Malley put us on a very negative trajectory with consistently higher taxes funding consistently more intrusive government bureaucracy. Despite improvement, we are one bad governor away from becoming CA or NY, where sky high-taxes and ill-conceived regulations drive business and economic opportunity away.    Very few of our legislators have any private sector experience (working at a law firm part-time doesn't count). They generally view private business as a cow to be milked for tax revenue.","Yes to an Independent Commission! Gerrymandering undermines democracy, increasing the power of special interests, fringe pressure groups and party bosses. It encourages rampant partisanship and discourages bipartisan solutions.   Senate District 42 is actually case study in gerrymandering- it was created by O'Malley to punish Democratic Sen. Brochin for being too independent and bi-partisan.  But then to my opponent, Delegate Lafferty, a loyal machine partisan, they let him carve out a single member sub-district.  Since that gerrymandering, Del. Lafferty began pushing a much more extreme agenda that doesn't serve Towson's residents- sponsoring the Home Act (forcing more Section 8 & handing power over Towson to an unaccountable, anti-democratic regional quasi-government) or killing common sense measures to audit Dallas Dance's tech contracts.   The job of Delegate is to actually represent the interests of your constituents, not partisan agendas or special interests. Gerrymandering makes it possible to not focus on your constituents, and still get reelected.","Law enforcement, along with other public sector workers, deserve protection from politically motivated witch hunts, incompetent personnel decisions, or grandstanding prosecutions like what we saw from Marilyn Mosby in the wake of Freddie Gray.  At the same time, those protections can go too far and insulate incompetent or malevolent behavior.  The story of the Gun Trace Task Force was a truly alarming violation of basic civil rights.  I am open to considering changes where appropriate.","We need to address this as a public health crisis, and first do whatever it takes to keep addicts from killing themselves before they can undertake long-run treatment.    We should fund more addiction treatment with the proceeds from legalized marijuana.","The state can address income inequality by focusing on its core responsibility- providing a world-class education and fostering the conditions for robust economic opportunity.    We have systemic failure in the City school system.  It is an astounding failure that in some half a dozen city high schools, serving thousands of kids, there is not a single person who tests proficient.  With a failure this extreme, there is something more going on than deep poverty, teacher quality, lack of resources (when we spend nearly $17k per pupil).  MD is worst in the US for charter school. Parents who live in the catchment of persistently failing dangerous schools deserve a real choice.","No.    One case study where I've used the PIA: right now, Baltimore County is the target of the largest HUD sponsored relocation program in the US. This has been carried out in deliberate secrecy, imposed through litigation before federal and state agencies that do not make their records public.  Kamenetz's settlement of the ACLU/PJC/NAACP suit in March 2016 was negotiated in secret. The entire record of this litigation is non-public. Although I have received a couple thousand pages, there are over 10,000 pages relating to the Baltimore County suit alone that are still being hidden from the public. The extreme ideologically motivated interest groups that sued Baltimore County are doing this in secret for a reason- they seek an incredible amount of completely unaccountable power for themselves. And the arguments they make to justify taking this power from democratic institutions would not withstand the slightest public scrutiny.   Specific changes to the PIA Act- matters of public import need to be made available free of charge. Special interests shouldn't be able to try imposing policy through secret litigation, and then claim every document thereafter is exempt from disclosure because it is a ""settlement negotiation"".     Transparency & accountability are at the core of democracy.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

I am committed to funding the associated reforms. The reforms will offer a sea change in how we view education in Maryland, and it will usher in real progress, real hope. It will be funded through the casino revenue and contributions to the state/counties. The fund will be dedicated to funding education only and not deposited in the general fund, We also propose raising tax to fund education.","No.. The state has the resources to meet its transportation needs. The transit system (Metro) is funded through a combination of jurisdictional subsidies and federal grants, but does not have a dedicated funding . I do not believe that Baltimore region is adequately served by transit. This is because the region is congested and most roads need substantial improvement","Maryland has decriminalized small possession of marijuana. The passing of Senate Bill 364 in 2014 made the possession of less than 10 grams of recreational marijuana for personal use a civil offense that carries no jail time and a maximum fine of $100. However, possession of greater quantities is still a criminal offense. Carrying up to 50 pounds of marijuana is a misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine. Possession of quantities greater than 50 pounds is a felony in the state. Maryland also imposes minimum mandatory sentences for some marijuana-related offenses. However, I support the legalization of recreational marijuana as a first amendment right.","Maryland should impose penalties for those companies that pollute the bay. They should be charged to pay for the cleanup. The state should also control the amount of runoffs farmers are allowed to produce. There should be a massive education of use of pesticides, and other harmful materials. Government should form federal/state and private partnership to come up withy recommendations and possible resources to protect the resources.","Maryland should adopt a single payer model to ensure the broadest possible access to affordable healthcare. Single-payer national health insurance, also known as ""Medicare for all,"" is a system in which a single public or quasi-public agency organizes health care financing, but the delivery of care remains largely in private hands. Under a single-payer system, all residents of the U.S. would be covered for all medically necessary services, including doctor, hospital, preventive, long-term care, mental health, reproductive health care, dental, vision, prescription drug and medical supply costs.  The program would be funded by the savings obtained from replacing today's inefficient, profit-oriented, multiple insurance payers with a single streamlined, nonprofit, public payer, and by modest new taxes based on ability to pay. Premiums would disappear; 95 percent of all households would save money. Patients would no longer face financial barriers to care such as co-pays and deductibles, and would regain free choice of doctor and hospital. Doctors would regain autonomy over patient care.",The state should play a very active role in helping Baltimore address violent crime. The state should direct more than 500 state parole and probation officers to partner with the Baltimore Police Department to track down and arrest repeat criminals who have parole and probation violations. The U.S. Marshal Service should begin sweeping the city with  task force officers. They will work with the state and city on serving warrants and carrying patrols in many troubled areas. More funds should be made available to help pay for overtime and other associated services.,Maryland business climate is improving but state intervention to attract more businesses. The state should set aside dedicated funds so that small business owners can have easy access to start off funds. Business regulation should be streamlined and business taxes reduced. Set aside funds to encourage businesses to relocate to Maryland.,I fully support the creation of a non-partisan body to draw legislative and congressional district maps after each census. This will ensure fairness and remove political influence in determining districts.,"The Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights does not adequately balance protections for police and the public. It should be modified or changed. As currently structured, LEOBR grants police officers special rights when they are investigated for misconduct, imposes significant impediments to conducting an adequate investigation and takes responsibility for discipline away from police chiefs. Significantly, LEOBR is a substantial barrier to transparency that precludes meaningful civilian oversight of the disciplinary process. And because of these flaws, a great many people have no faith that the officers who police our communities will be held accountable when they act improperly.  Several changes are needed to bring the statute in line with what is granted to public employees generally and what is granted in other states to their police. Currently superiors may not question their officers for 10 days following an incident. Not only are officers entitled to an attorney, union attorneys are usually available to them immediately. There is no need for an additional waiting period. Ten days simply impedes investigation and significantly delays the ability of police departments to communicate effectively with the public about what happened. The new law should revise the waiting period.",Establish more drug treatment centers and hire adequate drug counselors promptly evaluate and recommend treatment. Have doctors reduce the amount painkillers and other drugs they prescribe. Government should declare a drug and overdose crisis emergency so as to direct resources to treatment and counseling.,We have to find ways of redistributing wealth. Government should create jobs that will pay meaningful living wage. There should be a government and private partnership to review wage structure and training program. People should be trained in those hard to fill jobs that pay well so that people can find jobs and get off welfare and unemployment.,No. We should strengthen the whistle blowing laws that adequately protect people that are willing to provide information of waste and mismanagement.

I attended the University of Maryland, College Park, and graduated with a degree in Government, with concentrations in Spanish and History. I attended the Lutheran Theological Seminary in Philadelphia and earned my Masters of Divinity, after doing an internship year in Odenton.","Since 2011, I have served as a chaplain at the University of Maryland, College Park, and since 2015 as Senior Pastor at Hope Lutheran Church in College Park. After college I served in Argentina for a year, serving a local church and a human rights organization. I went on to serve the better part of the next two years in different social service agencies on several different continents.","We need to do everything we can to help our students succeed. I strongly support the Commission's work and am committed to supporting the reforms outlined in the report.  Several schools in District 21 are in desperate need of repair, and unsurprisingly these tend to be under-performing schools. We need to devote more resources for at-risk, low income, and students with disabilities to break the so-called school to prison pipeline.   Retaining quality teachers has been difficult, and we need to appropriately compensate these hard working professionals who are tasked with one of the most important jobs in our society.  I especially support universal pre-k, so that all students come to kindergarten ready to learn, and free summer programming for low income students to help lessen the learning gap that is often exacerbated during the summer. I also agree with the commission's recommendation to strengthen the system of governance and accountability to ensure that our students are being best served by their schools.  Providing a quality education for our children is a costly but necessary investment in the future of our state. It is an essential task of our elected officials to ensure that each child has what they need to flourish. I strongly support legislative efforts to ensure that all casino and gambling money  contribute entirely additional, rather than replacement, funds for our education budget, as it was originally sold to the public. I'm committed to providing the additional resources necessary to fully implement the Kirwan Commission recommendations.","When I first came to Prince George's County in 2000, the Metro Rail system was one of the region's selling points. We failed to invest in our infrastructure, including basic maintenance and safety standards, to the point where it has become a significant liability. The new regional investment in WMATA is a good start, and I am glad to see that construction on the Purple Line is set to begin. But we still need to improve existing services, including MARC and Washington-area bus services. We need to improve mass transportation options in the greater Baltimore area too, which helps take cars off the road, relieves congestion, and helps  lower our carbon footprint. The cancellation of the Red Line and a preference for suburban road-building was not only a lost opportunity for economic investment and transportation equity in the Baltimore region, but fails to promote transportation values that help avoid suburban sprawl, congestion, and environmental degradation. We can't afford to squander future mass transit opportunities, especially when they come with significant federal funding.  Walkable and bike-able communities are part of the solution, too. I want to work with counties and municipalities to build complete streets (safer streets for everyone, including walkers and bikers). New development needs to be prioritized around already existing mass transit options. And with so many important questions left unanswered and because of the disruption it would cause to our communities, I do not support the current MAGLEV (high speed train) proposal.","I support decriminalizing the use and possession of small amounts of marijuana.  But we need to do more to be smart on crime when it comes to drugs.    Addiction to illegal drugs often leads to other crimes,  and some studies show that substance abuse accounts for a majority of patients who  use our emergency departments without health insurance. We need to invest in better treatment options that will allow people to get the help they need and will save money in the long run.   I favor setting up a few strategically placed clean, safe centers for addicts to shoot up. These centers, as has been observed in other parts of the world don't serve to encourage drug use, but help save lives when overdoses happen, and help build trust and steer addicts into the programs they need to get clean. These innovative centers have been proven to work well, and for the health of our citizens and neighborhoods are worth trying, at least on a trial basis.","We are making important strides in restoring the Chesapeake Bay, and cannot afford to halt our hard-won momentum.  We need to increase our use of renewable energy and to reclassify what counts as a renewable energy source. Current law sets a target of 25% of our energy usage coming from renewable energy sources by 2020. The important question is, what counts as a renewable energy source?  Wind, solar, hydroelectric, and trash incinerators. Why do trash incinerators count as a renewable energy source? Several years ago, after over $100,000 of campaign contributions by trash incinerator companies, Maryland classified them as a renewable energy source. As a result, we continue to subsidize these major polluters with state funds. This must end, and this example demonstrates the importance  of removing big money from state politics. I am not taking and corporate or Political Action Committee money and even limiting what I'll take from individuals, because we can't afford to have big money set our policy.  I support programs that help local communities develop and implement strategies to manage storm water. For example, I have worked with the Prince George's Department of the Environment and several other leaders and partnered with University of Maryland students to launch a ""Friends of Guilford Run"" group to help protect a local stream in College Park. These students have been eager to gather teams to clean up trash, plant native plants, remove invasive species, and more, all things that help the Chesapeake.","While I applaud the effort to prop up the state's health insurance marketplace in light of Congressional sabotage, we still have hundreds of thousands of Marylanders who don't currently have insurance. Premiums continue to rise, along with our anxiety. Medical debt continues to be the number one cause of bankruptcy in the United States. We continue to spend more than twice as much per capita on healthcare than most developed countries, with little to no difference in life expectancy. We have some of the best medical facilities in the world right here in Maryland, and yet health care inequality  continues to rise. While there are many who benefit from the current system, we need to find ways to lower costs and make sure that everyone has access to quality health care.   We can't just wait and see what happens on the federal level. We can be innovators and lead. I pledge to work with stakeholders to devise and implement a plan in the single payer mold, to ensure all Marylanders get the quality health care they deserve and allowing the broadest possible access to quality health care.","Primary leadership on addressing violent crime in Baltimore needs to come from the citizens and the elected officials of the city. I look forward to working with elected officials from Baltimore to help support them in their efforts.  On a state level, we are positioned to help address the root causes of crime in the form of systemic disadvantage and poor outcomes for young people growing up in segregated, high-poverty areas. First and foremost, we need to support our education system and provide wrap around services for our children to make sure they have strong support systems as they grow into adulthood. Community colleges, apprenticeship programs, summer employment programs, and other alternative paths for young people is critical to ensuring that every young person has an opportunity to fulfill their potential—benefitting themselves and our state.   A smart approach to crime includes better treatment programs for those experiencing addiction, as mentioned in other questions above.  We also need to nurture and restore trust between the police and the people they serve. This includes building public accountability. We must fully fund local programs such as Safe Streets that help local outreach workers connect with high risk youth and young adults to help defuse dangerous situations and keep neighborhoods safe. I have seen firsthand the value of such programs, and strongly support expanding them to other parts of Baltimore.","We need more quality, good paying jobs that help people provide for their families. We have shown a willingness to  throw large sums of money to try and lure top international companies to move to Maryland, but I want to focus on helping  Maryland entrepreneurs launch new businesses that will bring new jobs to our state and ensure that the profits are reinvested in our local communities, not just by shareholders around the world. I want to work with counties and municipalities to build programs to work with those starting businesses, especially to help them navigate the process,","Yes! Extreme partisan gerrymandering is bad for democracy, no matter which party it benefits. Along with our broken campaign finance system, partisan gerrymandering undermines public trust in our government.  Regardless of what other states do or don't do, we shouldn't make excuses about why we won't do the right thing.","Just like every profession, there are some police officers who excel at their jobs, and some who do not. I have heard from some outstanding police officers who privately are frustrated with actions and the lack of repercussions of some of their colleagues. For the sake of public safety, we need to be sure that police officers are held accountable for actions that betray the trust of Marylanders and endanger the very people they are serving. We need to be sure that those convicted of felonies on the job are not allowed to continue in their positions.   I support body cameras for all police officers and state troopers. I also support civilian involvement on review boards, along with increased transparency. In this time and place, we need to build the public trust of law enforcement, and transparency is a necessary step towards that goal.","From 1999 to 2010, opioid prescriptions quadrupled in this country, even as addiction rates and overdoses increased. Opioid related deaths have topped 40,000 a year in this country, and the trend is getting worse. Increased attention has helped but there is much more to do. Any solution needs to comprehensively address root causes and involve drug companies, physicians, treatment centers, insurance companies, state regulators, and public policy.   We need to further limit the legal use and amount of opioids prescribed. We must devote significant resources to Medical Assisted Treatment and other effective treatments for opioid addiction, even though costs can be high and not entirely covered by many insurance plans. We also need to make sure that Naloxone continues to be available and that more people are trained to use it in order to help reverse an overdose.    These actions need to be done in partnership with neighboring states and the federal government, which needs to tighten the international shipping requirements of opioids (as more and more packages filled with opioids come into the country) and provide more funding to help combat this dangerous epidemic.","There is a lot that the state can and should do to address income inequality, beginning with education. We need to invest in the public schools and wrap around services that serve low income neighborhoods. We also need to provide more need based financial assistance for Marylanders to attend vocational training programs, community college, and public colleges and universities.   We need to make sure that workers in our state can earn a living wage to support themselves and their families. I support increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour. For too long our tax dollars have been subsidizing businesses that underpay their workers.","We need to continue to push for transparency, and ensure that adequate resources are provided to allow citizens to hold our government accountable. Maryland currently ranks poorly compared to other states when it comes to access to public information and transparency. This is unacceptable.  We also need increased transparency when it comes to campaign finance. There continue to be a proliferation of LLC's especially that are set up to provide shadow money to candidates, allowing wealthy donors to circumvent the rules. If we won't join other states in banning corporate donations, we at least need to provide adequate resources to ensure that our campaign finance laws be adequately enforced.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

However, I know it is imperative to address the teacher recruitment and outreach efforts because schools across the state and nation are struggling to obtain and retain qualified teachers.  Providing incentives for young people to go into the teaching field while having retired teachers come in and offer peer support can be beneficial to the over all system. I will be supportive of the reforms that will address school construction funding, special education funding for pre-k and  saftey measures.","The balance of roads and transit have always been a struggle and for the immediate future will continue to be.  Each jurisdiction wants to ensure transportation needs are met and the need is truly great.  In the rural communities, it remains a struggle to ensure disabled persons in the outlying areas get serviced; however that can't comfortably happen due to the inability to have non fixed routes available to disabled persons.  As a state, we are working towards the restoral of Highway User Revenues, and will continue to work along with municipalities and counties to addressed the most pressing projects and do our best to make them happen.",No,"Set aside additional funds within Maryland's budget to keep protecting the Bay, as it is a vital resource for Maryland's economy and the health and wealth of daily living.  Additionally, as a state law maker, I will continue to press my federal counterparts to make the Chesapeake Bay a priority.  We are seeing progress through watershed reports and through efforts that farmers and environmentalists are making and we must continue to fight for our quality of life.","Through recent legislation passed creating a task force to look at funding formulas for the cost of premiums and working along with the Federal Government by way of requesting waivers is a strategic and necessary step.  Additionally, affordable health care has to have all stakeholders at the table to address long term plans.  We have started down the road to identify dental health is a priority by having a pilot program.",Continue to fund initiatives that have proven results such as Safe Streets.  This intiative is a postive tool that is backed by annual funding in the budget.,"Recent studies have shown that Maryland has the highest rate of per capita minority and women business ownership in the United States, to that end, the business climate is progressive; however we (Maryland) have more that we can do to reduce barriers to allow additional people into the small business world.  Family supporting jobs would be to create a consortium of businesses with on site daycare,  a climate with flex time.",Yes,There is room for improvment to ensure a true balance is realized.,"I believe that the legislation that I have co sponsored and supported to address the opioid addiction and overdose crisis has merit and I am eager to see many of these tools work in our communities.  This crisis is going to have to be fought on many fronts with citizens, health and law professionals at the helm.  Maryland is making strides on the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program.  Additionally, as we have  health care professionals informing patients of how opioids can be harmful if used too long and educating citizens on the risks and signs of addiction.  The grants that are being administered through the Health Departments will get the funds on the ground.  It is extremely important to me that we continue to have regular dialogue with youth in and out of schools.","Comprehensively review the economic viability in each jurisdication, to which counties such as Somerset and Dorchester could identify what types of businesses & support would be needed to drive a stronger economy.  Additionally, all industries (health, forestry, hospitality, industrial) will need to identify where support (financial, policies etc) is needed to ensure that they are not blocked in order to have wages rise to the level that all persons can have a decent quality of life.","Yes, I believe the Public Information Act and open meeting laws are adequate at this time because of the past few years the MD Legislature passed laws to ensure persons are being trained, new levels of transparency to ensure compliance at all levels of government.

We must continue to monitor the income from the casinos to make sure that the proceeds sent to the State and  Counties are appropriately applied to educational budgets.","We must continue to collaborate with our partners in the Federal Government to bolster our transportation funding. This assistance can help to avoid new taxes or fees. We must make certain that funds are appropriately allocated to roads and transit where they are most needed. A survey of all transit routes and methods  should be conducted to make certain that the routes, schedules and current modes of transportation are efficient and meet the demands of our population.","No, I do not.  As a pharmacist I am concerned about how the industry would be managed and how the safety and quailty of the product would be controlled and tested. Currently marijuana is illegal under the laws of the Federal Government. Legalization of recreational marijuana will put  Maryland in conflict with those laws and potentially jeopardize our Federal funding.","I co-sponsored the Clean Energy Act and the Clean Energy Jobs Act for the State in this last session and have promoted alternate energy programs. I am pleased that we are working with Chesapeake Bay management industries to continue oyster seeding and developement of new oyster beds. We should continue to work with our waterman and farm communitunites to increase healthy, clean water practices. We are continuing to encourage green building and innovative construction that reduces land waste that impacts the Chesapeake Bay.","We need waiver and subsidy programs for our lower income residents and our growing senior citizen population that require assistance with their medical needs. This is a situation that requires constant management, consideration, review and improvement. We need a continued emphasis on accomplishing the goal of providing affordable health care to all of our citizens in Maryland.",The State should pay great attention to the issues of crime in Baltimore City as there is no dividing line that separates their population with that of the surrounding jurisdictions. What impacts the City effects us all. The State has put money into grants that all jurisdictions can access which will help assist law enforcement agencies with crime reduction programs.,Currently Maryland's business climate needs improvement. Businesses should encourage better skills and job training for their employees. The State should encourage lower tuition costs and encourage educational support for graduating high school seniors. Competetive tax relief and tax incentives should be used to encourage businesses to come to Maryland over surrounding states offering incentives to various industries and corporations. Small businesses are crucial to our economy and our community.  We should continue to offer support to them so that we can encourage their growth.,"I support fair and equitable geographic lines for each district, no matter who makes the decisions. I would certainly be open to the possibility of a non-partisan board as long as the body is transparent and conducts open meetings, allowing public comment and involvement.","Yes, I believe it does.  The Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights as it is intended provides adequate protection for citizens, any accused, and the Law Enforcement Officer.","Education for all including prescribing physicians and health practitioners. Increase the number of treatment beds and the length of stay for treatment. Provide assistance to law enforcement agencies for their critical public education and intervention programs in the community. The crisis needs to be addressed by Health Care practitioners, Law Enforcement Agencies and the Court system working together with families and the public.","The State continues to work with businesses to be certain that ""Equal Pay for Equal Work"" is the standard in the job market. The State also continues to address complaints regarding income disparity and potential discriminatory practices. As a delegate I do support and will continue to support all initiatives for equality in business practices.",I believe they are adequate to meet the needs of the communities and the public as long as the State follows the  written guidlines as established by the legislature and allows for proper vetting of the issues.

I went on to Washington and Lee University School of Law, earning a Juris Doctor degree.","After law school, I served as a judicial law clerk at the Circuit Court for Baltimore City for the Honorable George L. Russell, III. and then worked as a Policy Analyst with the Maryland Department of Public Safety and Correctional Services.  I then transitioned to become a small-business owner as an insurance agent.  With a great staff, I have been able to open a second agency, which is located in my district and transform my first agency into an award-winning operation that has since doubled in size.","I wholeheartedly support the preliminary recommendations of the Kirwan commission. Initiatives such as broadened vocational training and education opportunities, increased teacher compensation, and universal pre-kindergarten are especially germane to the needs of our city.  A quality and comprehensive public education system is a powerful antidote to the plague of poverty which afflicts much of our Baltimore community and our state as a whole. After being the national leader in education for years, Maryland has unfortunately slipped to sixth in the nation, achieving a B- grade. If we want to reclaim our standing, our state government must protect and prioritize education appropriation.  I am committed to championing any measures supporting education funding. I am hopeful that the lockbox referendum will be approved in November, thereby ensuring effective educational funding through state casino revenue.","The severity of this issue was underscored in the 2015 Harvard study which found that inefficient public transit is the leading cause of continued poverty. This is unacceptable. First, I would make sure that BaltimoreLink is properly funded to ensure a sufficient amount of buses and routes. Secondly, I would continue to work on building enough support for the Red Line or a similar variation. With such a large percentage of unemployment, especially within minority communities, we need to continue to promote multiple forms of transit to living wage jobs.  It will take a dedicated and deliberate exercise of political will on the behalf of our state elected officials to bring a comprehensive and effective transit system to our Baltimore region. Our regional representatives must spearhead this effort.","The proposed benefits of the legalization of recreational marijuana are wide-ranging. The economic impact of regulation and taxation of cannabis businesses would bring in millions of dollars in additional state revenue.  Furthermore, legalization would allow law enforcement to redirect more resources to combat criminal activity. Legalization would also free up our courts and prisons from the prosecution and incarceration of thousands of non-violent individuals, which disproportionately impacts the African-American community. With all of this being said, I do believe that the legalization of recreational marijuana needs to be approached deliberately, but cautiously. There are societal costs that could possibly counterbalance the aforementioned proposed benefits. I believe that further assessment of the long-term comprehensive impact of legalization in other states should be conducted and considered before recreational marijuana becomes legal in Maryland.","The Chesapeake Bay is an integral part of our region and therefore needs continued safeguarding.  I will support legislation protecting the Bay, such as the Offshore Drilling Liability Act, which passed this past session. Additionally, municipal sewers leaks and sewage overflows from treatment facilities are particularly concerning. I would support heightened state oversight of these issues.",Healthcare is truly a basic human right. I therefore support a single-payer health care system so Marylanders can have access to quality health care and freedom from financial hardship due to enormous medical debt. Program funding would be made possible by factors including the reduction in health insurance administrative costs and the increased demand of employment opportunities within the state.,"Too often when discussing the issue of crime, the symptoms are confused with the underlying causes. Mass incarceration has been clearly shown to be an ineffective method for reducing violent crime. There has not been enough of a focus on strengthening the rehabilitative effect of the correctional system. And once returning citizens come back home, there is a lack of sufficient services to facilitate a positive life change. Recidivism is a major contributor to criminal activity. It costs the state and city millions of dollars in medical and correctional services. The broader societal costs are exponentially higher. Real Chance Real Change is my initiative for our returning citizens that will provide wraparound services, including housing, vocational training, mental health, and financial literacy. During this time, program members will serve as advocates in the neighborhoods they came up in. This will provide much needed additional advocacy for our forgotten neighborhoods. After completion of the program, jobs will be guaranteed by local businesses who are incentivized by state tax credits. The designed impact of this initiative would therefore be to reduce recidivism and new participants of criminal activity, while providing more skilled labor to local businesses.","With the vigorous regional competition from Virginia and D.C., Maryland must continue to becoming increasingly attractive to companies of all sizes. As a small business owner, I understand the impact that family-supporting jobs can have on the health of a community. I support the responsible use of business incentives at the state-level to stimulate job creation, such as tax-credits and grants.","I believe that our elected representatives should not cede the authority to outline congressional and legislative district boundaries to an unelected group of individuals. I would be inclined to support initiatives like the Mid-Atlantic Compact, where the six regional states would all undergo redistricting in a bipartisan manner. Such measures would ensure procedural equity among the parties.","The relationship between the community and the Baltimore Police Department has clearly deteriorated over time. Mutual trust must be gradually established to mend the broken relationship. Amending the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights (LEOBR), is a critical step towards increasing the community confidence in the equity and efficacy of police actions.  I support the appointment of a civilian to the proposed three-member panel specifically tasked with hearing and addressing cases involving police brutality. As a delegate, I also intend to hold regular community meetings in the district, bringing together community stakeholders and the representatives of the relevant police districts to help bridge the divide. Ultimately, it will take a healthy partnership with the community and the police to enhance the quality of life within our city.","Opioid addiction has been ravaging our Baltimore community for decades. With almost ten percent of our population suffering under the sickness of addiction, we must act with purpose and commitment to address this issue. The increase in the lethality of the drugs, including but not limited to, carfentanil has been particularly alarming.  Increased funding for traditional drug treatment facilities is essential. We must however be comprehensive in our efforts to ameliorate this scourge, including initiatives promoting better education and vocational training opportunities, mental health and wraparound family services, and active community support centers.","Discrimination across the board must be addressed at every opportunity by the state. For example, discrimination in the ability to own a home has been a long-standing problem. The most prevalent source of family wealth is found in home ownership. Suitable housing is a basic necessity for all of our residents, irrespective of income-level. From the municipal perspective, I support the affordable housing trust fund to provide quality low and moderate income housing opportunities. At the state level, I would explore the feasibility of utilizing some of the casino revenue to provide an ongoing financing source for the trust fund.","Public officials, and the government as a whole are to be accessible and accountable to all Marylanders. The Public Information Act (PIA) and open meeting laws are therefore critical to ensuring effective governmental oversight. The outmoded PIA rendered inefficient the facilitation of transparency. I support legislative initiatives, such as the establishment of the Public Information Act Compliance Board to improve public confidence in their government.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

He served on the board of directors at the United Way of Frederick County, as the chairman of the Frederick County Affordable Housing Council, and worked for the Housing Authority of the City of Frederick, promoting opportunities for residents to thrive in Frederick. Ryan also served as Senator Ronald N. Young's Legislative Aid and currently works for the City of Baltimore as a legislative liaison and public information officer.","It is difficult to fully support the finding of the commission with the release of the full report. Based on their preliminary recommendations, I can say that I support the scope and overall message of the commission. To be successful, Maryland must expand universal pre-K, prepare students for college, career, and the new economy, and invest in a diverse, knowledgeable, and well-trained staff. However supporting families requires more than universal pre-K, I also support the commission's recommendations that the State ""(1) significantly expand its network of Judy Centers and Family Support Centers to reach all low-income families with children who need them; (2) increase child care subsidies so that working families have access to affordable, high-quality child care; and (3) expand the current infant and toddlers program that provides support to families with special needs children. Maryland's education system is a very good system and is competitive nationally, but our economy is no longer regional or national, our workforce and products compete across the world and our students must be prepared for this reality. All of our students should be learning in buildings with technology supplies geared toward the 21st century. This includes supporting local trade programs and ensuring that student-tradesmen earn industry-recognized certifications by graduation to be competitive in the workforce.  The commission also noted that ""An abundance of highly qualified teachers working as high-status professionals is perhaps the single biggest factor in the success of these top-performing systems."" Maryland must increase its investment in teachers and staff.","Maryland is a diverse state, some places in Maryland need more spending on mass transit while others need a stronger focus on roads. Our policy should reflect this need and attempt to balance our current infrastructure needs with our future transportation aspirations. Areas like Frederick are currently lack regular, dependable accessibility to Baltimore or DC by anything other than cars. An increasing focus on transit, both rail and bus, to better connect the Frederick, Baltimore, DC triangle is vital to the growth, economic viability, and accessibility of the region.  Simply, the Baltimore region is not adequately served by transit. BaltimoreLink has not been the solution to a City's transit woes in the aftermath of the cancelation of a mass transit project.","Yes. I believe that the legalization of marijuana may help reduce the need for opioid prescriptions and can help reduce the opioid epidemic.  I also believe that it is a crucial element in the recent movement towards a more just criminal justice system with the justice reinvestment act, if enacted properly. Additionally, legalization can be an important source of revenue for state and local government. I would support quick action to maintain a first mover advantage, regionally speaking. This would allow the state to assess a tax similar to cigarettes bringing in substantial revenue. The state should earmark at least 20% of these funds for communities disproportionately impacted by the war on drugs and drug-related mass incarcerations. Like other communities and states across the country, Maryland must allow for the expungement of criminal records and release of incarcerated individuals whose crimes would not be considered crimes under marijuana legalization.",Maryland should continue to invest in technologies and local projects that aim to reduce runoff into the Bay. DC recently completed a project that has been extremely successful in reducing sewer overflow and are anticipating that the Anacostia River will be swimmable by 2025. Maryland must ensure that counties that have large overflows are able to invest in similar types of technology. The state must also work with farmers to guarantee that they have access to technologies that prevent their farms from being large sources of pollution.,"Stabilizing the insurance markets was a crucial step this past legislative session. I will work with my colleagues and advocates to continue to do so. Maryland should study joining a multistate healthcare compact (NY, California, Washington/New England) to build a Medicare-for-all type system until the federal government is ready to be a viable partner again.  In the meantime, Maryland can expand funding for community health models and also expand transportation access that way families and neighbors can count on regular, dependable transportation to and from doctor's appointments.","In the short-term, the state can fund safestreets and invest in violence reduction programs. When seeking long-term strategies to violent crime, the state must partner with the local government and school system to adequately invest in education (see question 7), transportation (see question 8), seek restorative justice, and promote economic development which pays a fair wage for an honest days' work and provides protections to workers and families.","The state can partner with local governments to invest in the small businesses that are already here before offering billions to a multinational firm. by supporting the growth and viability of established, local businesses we allow them to thrive and their staffs to put down roots in Maryland to raise their families.  Maryland can increase its support of entrepreneurs by expanding access to incubator assistance and leveraging our state's top-notch community colleges with upstate talent.  The state can also make it easier to form public benefit corporations and cooperatives, as well as make it easier for them to be competitive and earn government contracts. Another way to create more family-supporting jobs is to invest in transit, job training programs for 21st-century skills as well as the building trades, and increasing the minimum wage.","Yes, I support the creation of a non-partisan, independent body to draw legislative and congressional district maps after each census. It is imperative to our democracy that we ensure that all Marylanders are being properly represented in Washington and Annapolis. We should also lead by example and show states like Pennsylvania and Virginia how to go from a partisan model to a non-partisan one.","In the wake of the DOJ's report on the BPD, GTTF case LEOBOR deserves serious consideration for reform. An important step is Senator Fergusons & Delegate McCray's legislation to create a Commission to Restore Trust in Policing to review the operation of the Baltimore Police Department's Gun Trace Task Force and make recommendations on the reorganization of the Police Department and certain other matters as necessary. Using the recommendations, I would make it easier to get rid of an officer that commits unwarranted acts of violence towards civilians. We must hold the police to the highest standard possible and we cannot allow for another City or County's police force to allow a unit to rob, injure, frame, and cheat the public out of their tax dollars.","Overdose deaths are preventable. The state can support a collective impact, public health model based on North Carolina's Project Lazarus. This model has three core components and seven ""spokes"". The core components are public awareness, providing knowledge of the problem of overdose from prescription opioid analgesics, coalition action to coordinate all sectors of the community response, and data and evaluation which grounds a community's unique approach in their locally identified needs and improve interventions. The seven spokes include community education to improve the public's capacity to recognize and avoid the dangers of misuse/abuse of prescription opioids, provider education to support screening and appropriate treatment for mental illness, addiction, and pain, and hospital ED policies that encourage safe prescribing of controlled substances and provide meaningful referrals for chronic pain and addiction. Additionally, the model encourages diversion control to reduce the presence of unused medicines in society, pain patient support to help patients and caregivers manage chronic pain, harm reduction to help prevent opioid overdose deaths with the antidote naloxone, and addiction treatment to help find an effective treatment for those ready to enter recovery. Maryland could follow Pennsylvania's HB122 to establish a Project Lazarus Commission which could review and make recommendations related to a best practice model for a comprehensive, community-based effort to consolidate overdose prevention efforts for counties.","First, the state must invest in education, transportation, technology, broad economic development, and health. These investments will pay dividends far into the future. In addition, the state should lower the inheritance tax on non-farm estates from $4 million to $2 million; it is preposterous that people can transfer such vast sums of wealth across generations. The state should ban employers from asking what an employees salary was at a previous employer. Employers base a new employees wage on their previous wage. And we know that women and people of color earn less compared to white men. This would allow women and people of color a chance to earn what they deserve. Also, the state can begin by adequately funding and staffing DLLR. Having a strong watchdog agency would ensure that when people are found guilty of wage violations they would be penalized.","I believe that the legislative and executive branches respond in a rapid and efficient manner to MPIA requests. I will work with members of government, the media, and activists to devise a way to make government more responsive.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education? Are you committed to funding associated reforms, and if so, how?","Is Maryland’s transportation spending appropriately balanced between roads and transit?

I'm also committed to funding associated reforms. How I would fund the reform is with the MGM Casino funds instead of the the money going into a general fund would like to see it put in a sat aside education fund.,"The state have adequate money to meet the transportation needs because that is why we pay taxes. More people are using alternative methods to get to and from work and recreational activities to save money they use bicycles, zip cars, ulber and  lyft.",Yes,We need to continue to educate the residents of Maryland on how to keep the resources in the the Chesapeake growing. People in this area love Crabs so if there is a shortage people are upset if communication is provided then the citizen can help protect the Chesapeake Bay.,In third world country every citizen have health care. We should have one billable rate insurance that is affordable to all.,Violent crimes should have tougher consequences to help deter people from committing certain crimes. Need to offer more counseling during the person youth to help them learn how to deal with anger. A lot of problem are unaddressed and they are carried over into adulthood.,"We need to do better in attracting companies like Amazon and organizations like the  FBI because it will create more jobs and opportunities for our residents. People graduating from college are very disappointed with the job and career opportunities because the baby boomers are staying on the jobs longer. Also , places like Safeway, home depot, shoppers, target and McDonald's are going to self checkout which that option is a  job eliminator because you don't need a cashier.",yes,"I would say no because it is intended to protect the law enforcement officer from investigation and prosecution arriving from their conduct during official performances of their duties, and provides them with privileges based on the due process additional to those normally provided to to other citizens. We need to change it so that if the officer is wrong he can  be disciplined and or removed if they are a bad officer.",Educate the children in our public schools the affects of the drugs. Have treatment and rehabilitation facilities. We also need to hold the drug dealers accountable for pushing these drugs in our communities.,For large corporation with employees over 50 should have to pay a livable wages. The small companies can not afford to pay the $15  because then they will have to mark up their products or services to cover the high wages.,It is a good way for them to be included and in the know about what is happening in their communities.,"Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

,YES,state-house,18,Linda Willard,Willard,04/26/1969,Chevy Chase,Republican,Montgomery County,,,,http://surveygizmoresponseuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/fileuploads/296249/4297291/117-a5224ada968eaa5e4f384c36f5b856a5_LW-35.JPG,"A.B., History and Theology, Georgetown University (Magna Cum Laude,  Phi Beta Kappa)  J.D.,  Georgetown University Law Center","Counsel, U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works;   Attorney, Verner, Liipfert, Bernhard, McPherson, and Hand;  Attorney, Sullivan & Worcester;  Senior Policy Adviser and Counsel, TCH Group","I strongly support the Kirwan Commission's finding that resources should be allocated more efficiently and effectively, instead of continuously increasing funds for education.   I  support increased teacher salaries,  school safety, and career education.  Without a final report of the Commission of how such funds would be allocated; however, I can not fully support the Commission's specific findings.   Any formulaic changes should account not only for low-income disparities, but also for population growth.  Montgomery County, for example,  accounts for 40 percent of the State's annual student growth, but its share of State funding does not reflect its proportionate contribution.  Also, for the State's under-performing schools, funds alone are not the answer.   The creation of mentorship programs with older students from higher-performing schools is one low-cost way we could elevate the schools in greatest need and encourage more high school students to consider teaching as a career choice.   We need our best and brightest to serve as teachers in our local schools.  I strongly support optimizing State funds for public education and safety of students, and I look forward to seeing the final report of the Kirwan Commission.","While I believe that our transportation spending is appropriately balanced between roads and transit, I am not sure the State has the resources to meet all of its transportation needs.  I do support public-private partnerships that offer commuters the option of taking faster routes through tolled express lanes, as has been proposed for I-270 in Montgomery County.   I want to clarify; however, that I do not support blanket tolling of previously ""free"" roads along the lines of what Virginia has tried to do to I-66.    I would like to explore other innovative ways to meet our transportation demands effectively and efficiently.    I also think sensible maintenance of our most dangerous roads and bridges is critical.  It doesn't make sense to build new roads if our existing roads don't serve us.    Common-sense maintenance should include; however, ""recurbing""  and other cosmetic issues many of our citizens in Montgomery County have experienced.     With respect to transit, I am not as familiar with the Baltimore area, but in Montgomery County, I think we have done a pretty good job in working with our partners from other jurisdictions that comprise WMATA.   It is essential that transit and road projects fall within the master plan and aren't built soley for political reasons.","No,   I do not support the legalization of recreational marijuana in Maryland.     Currently, there is a conflict between federal and state law with the nine states that have decided to legalize recreational marijuana.   California, Colorado, Washington, and six other states are currently at odds with federal authorities with respect to marijuana.   I believe that a national solution would be the most effective way to deal with this difficult issue.","The Chesapeake Bay is our State's greatest resource and a national treasure.   Its protection requires far more than what we can do as a single State, but as a delegate, I will ensure this resources is protected and cherished.   Agricultural waste from chicken farms on the Eastern Shore should be addressed.  I would like to look into efforts into reducing the nutrient load from agriculture without harming farmers economically.    Best management practices, such as nutrient management plans and streamside buffers and fencing reduce runoff from nitrogen, phosphorous and other waste that harm the watershed.     I also support smart growth through land use planning.   County planners take a more measured and enlightened approach to transportation and other development projects.   To that end, I support the Forest Conservation bill, which stalled in the House Transportation Committee last year.    The value of trees and forested areas in acting as a filter to dangerous pollutants from agricultural runoff into the bay should be a given.  Moreover, regional initiatives such as the Chesapeake Bay 10 billion oyster restoration program are essential.   I strongly support working with our regional partners to protect our precious Bay.","The State took a step in the right direction with the recent enactment of legislation to keep rates in check for the next few years, but we need more to be done.  Governor Larry Hogan has proposed a bold set of initiatives to address this important issue.  I strongly support these efforts to bring stronger, more comprehensive,  and less costly medical care to Marylanders.","I strongly support Governor Hogan's recent proposal to enhance State police presence in Baltimore City.   I also support greater oversight of former criminals (those on parole or probation), as well as legislation calling for longer sentences for violent criminals.    Though I am not an expert on Baltimore given that I live in Montgomery County, I believe the solution to violent crime lies not only in stronger law enforcmenet but also in community development.   For example, the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health has a number of significant initiatives for community development which focus on scientific metrics, rather than prejudice or emotion.   If elected, I will encourage the State to support more fact-based solutions to the problem of violent crime in Baltimore.","I would characterize Maryland's business climate as better than it was four years ago, but not quite where it should be, particularly with respect to smaller businesses.   During Governor Hogan's administration, the State of Maryland has created 110,000 jobs, seen its unemployment  fall to 4 percent, and experienced a greater growth in domestic product out of all the 50 states.   This is good news, but it partially reflects the low statistics Governor Hogan inherited 2015.    We still have a way to go.  Regrettably, Montgomery County created the second fewest number of businesses in 2017 of any locality in the Washington Metropolitan region .   Our State needs not only the big businesses such as Amazon, Under Armour and McCormick, we also need small businesses.   Maryland can do more to create a friendlier environment for small businessses.  We need to enhance tax credits, such as the Maryland Biotech Tax Credit, to ensure growth of smaller businesses and the creation of more family-supporting jobs.  The State also should strengtheen support for education and training to ensure that Marylanders achieve their full potential in this 21st century economy.","Yes, I strongly support the creation of a non-partisan independent body to draw legislative and congressional district maps after each census.    The current system, which relies on partisan politics, has created voter apathy and cynicism.   For example, in my district (District 18), I am the first Republican in 12 years to run for delegate.   The current system also forces some voters in Montgomery County to change their registration from Republican or Independent to Democrat in the hopes of having a greater influence on the political process.     Every voter should have a voice, and under the current system, this is not possible.  I agree with the plaintiffs in Benisek v. Lamone, which is currently pending before the U.S. Supreme Court, that Maryland's 2011 redistricting of its Westernmost district to include more Democratic votes from Montgomery County violated voters' first amendment rights.  I support Governor Hogan's legislation to put the determination of  Maryland's legislative and congressional district maps in the hands of a nonpartisan commission.","I don't believe that the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights (LEOBOR)adequately balances protections for the police and the public.   While I am grateful for the sacrifices our law enforcement officers make in their sworn duty to protect us, officers should not be above the law.   The LEOBOR makes it impossible to discipline or remove bad officers, even in those instances where they have been convicted of felonies in courts.    While the vast majority of police officers are good people,  the public should be protected from corrupt and violent officers.   The LEOBOR's immunity for officers puts the public in danger.","The opioid crisis seems to be pervasive, but there are geographic pockets of our State and elsewhere in which it is rampant.   I would start by focusing on these areas in three ways:   1.  by reducing the availability of abusable prescription medicine;  2.  by making treatment options available to reduce withdrawal symptoms; and 3.  by building community support for people suffering from this dreadful addiction.     If elected, I also will encourage our Attorney General to  join Maryland as a plaintiff against corporations such as Perdue Pharmaceuticals and Endo Pharmaceuticals, which bear responsibility for the current crisis.      There is a direct correlation between  the opioid crisis and unemployment and isolation.   Creating jobs in affected areas is just one way to address the problem.   Local school boards in affected areas also should look at their curriculums and ask whether there is sufficient career based training for high-school students who do not opt to pursue a college degree.","I believe that income inequality should be addressed through a greater State commitment to education and community support rather than through the redistribution of wealth.  Poverty in Maryland is primarily the result of a lack of opportunities and should be addressed through education and training.    Unfortunately, discrimination continues to play a role in poverty.    We need to ensure that discrimination is not tolerated and efforts are made to give members of most vulnerable communities more opportunities to thrive.","I strongly support transparency in all aspects of Maryland government.   Statutes such as the Open Meeting Law are important first steps to ensure greater accesss to, and accountability of, Maryland government, but more can be done.  I will support proposals to solicit greater public comment on issues of importance to the legislature.  The current system does not permit a sufficient number of diverse voices to be heard in the current hearing process.  I will work actively to reform the way in whcih citizens testify and otherwise provide input to the Maryland Assembly if I am elected.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

(Chemistry), 2006 Ph.D. (Biochemistry), 2014 M.D., 2016 All degrees earned from Stony Brook University, in Stony Brook, NY","I worked for a little over a year as a resident physician in the field of psychiatry at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, before resigning my position and starting my first run for political office.","I broadly support the preliminary findings of the Commission, particularly its preliminary recommendations on the need to implement state-funded pre-K reflecting the importance of early childhood education, as well as their strategies on increasing standards and diversity in our teachers.  While I welcome the Commission's recommendations on ""equitable"" distribution of resources with priority to less wealthy jurisdictions, I would hasten to add that the education funding formula should be adjusted to also take into account the added need for resources, both in terms of general funding and in capital improvements, to school districts that are rapidly growing, such as those in my district and in Montgomery County as a whole.    In terms of funding, this can be best assured by holding the state accountable in fully funding education, not only through the Education Trust Fund, but also in maintaining and increasing the allocation to education from the general fund, which appears to be slipping.  The Education Trust Fund must be used as a supplement to general education funding from the state, not as a means of slowly replacing those funds.  If this can be done, then we will be able to afford the investment in education.","I believe the current transportation funding balance is appropriate.  I welcome the dedicated funding to Metro that was agreed during this legislative session.  I'm also cautiously supportive of Governor Hogan's public-private partnership plan to expand I-270 and other highways, provided that the plan receives a favorable environmental impact statement and he sticks to his promise of zero public funding for the initiative.    I do feel the Baltimore candidates can speak more persuasively about their transportation needs, but I do support a revival of the Red Line and believe that while BaltimoreLink can be a useful means of streamlining public transport services to Baltimore, a revival of the Red Line would still be necessary.","As a physician, although I do not believe marijuana to be a miracle drug or panacea that some legalization supporters purport it to be, I feel that the evidence on harm vs. benefit clearly supports a legalization of recreational marijuana use under a regime where use would be regulated and taxed, similar to alcohol sales in the state, and drawing upon the lessons learned by states that have already legalized recreational use of marijuana.  Such legalization should also make provision for the growing of a small amount of marijuana for personal use.    I believe passionately in the need to provide more funding and resources for drug treatment programs, especially free and subsidized inpatient resources (for all drug addictions), and increased research into the benefits and harms of cannabis, which have been lacking to date due in part to marijuana's continued classification as a Schedule I drug in the Controlled Substances Act.   An important priority would be to create a simple test equivalent to the ""breathalyzer"" for alcohol levels, that can aid in enforcing laws to prevent people from driving while under the influence of marijuana, as these cases might increase with legalization.","I am heartened by the fact that recently announced federal funding cuts to the Chesapeake Bay restoration did not materialize and I would work closely with our federal representatives to make sure that federal funding continues.  While ultimately Maryland should be willing to step in to provide funding should the federal government falter, I believe announcing this explicitly would not be politically wise, as it may paradoxically encourage the federal government to end its support.  I am also in favor of increased publicity to the great restoration work as well as encouraging citizens to volunteer their time and efforts to the cleanup process.","I am in favor of Mr. Jealous's ""Medicare-for-All"" plan for Maryland.  With a supermajority in the legislature and (hopefully) a Democratic governor, I believe it would be possible to pass this legislation, building on the ""all-payer"" model in existence in Maryland to a system where all our residents can have access to quality healthcare that is available to them regardless of whether or not they are lucky enough to have a job that provides healthcare benefits.    As a physician who worked in the mental health field, I am also excited by the prospect of increased mental health care, both in the outpatient and inpatient capacity, that such legislation would provide, as too many Marylanders, even those with insurance, often find it very difficult to see a mental health provider.","I believe this question is best addressed by candidates from the Baltimore area, and I would not presume to impose solutions on them.  That said, I have some thoughts.  The best way to reduce violent crime is to provide hope for the populace.  This starts with providing business-friendly policies that encourage an influx of quality jobs that can provide economic support to residents and also provide the tax dollars to fund other initiatives.  These other initiatives include strong support for education, both in terms of the quality of teachers and school resources, and also in providing ancillary services such as free and subsidized lunches and after-school programs.  This will allow students to focus on learning and achieving the skills they need to succeed in higher education or vocational training, and then get those high quality, high paying jobs I spoke of earlier.  By breaking the school-to-prison pipeline and replacing it with school to training to great jobs pipeline, communities will have the hope needed to break the yoke of violence.  Additionally, addressing the role of drug addiction and drug dealing that goes hand-in-hand with violent crime cannot be overemphasized.  By providing more funding for drug addiction treatment, including 24/7 centers as proposed by Mr. Jealous, those addicted to drugs can find hope.    Finally, focusing on community-police cooperation and implementing visible patrols to disperse known areas of drug dealing can give confidence to citizens of a new future and make it more difficult for crime to continue with impunity.","Mediocre business climate.  On the one hand, we have a highly educated and skilled workforce, generally low crime rates, and generally good access to transportation (although we still have room for improvement in these areas), and yet Maryland consistently ranks poorly on business climate surveys, primarily due to a high number of government regulations and a high state corporate tax as compared to other states.  These are not easy questions to solve, as decreasing the state corporate tax rate will of course mean a cut in services or new taxes, neither of which are popular, while many of the regulations in place protect families and the environment, particularly in terms of paid sick leave.  The best thing we can do is foster a culture of unwinding regulations to only those absolutely needed, improving infrastructure and education, and reducing the corporate tax burden gradually.  Once these efforts pick up steam, we can invest more in advertising and promoting Maryland as a great place to do business.  I am also quite supportive of the unprecedented incentives being offered to entice Amazon to build its second headquarters in the state.  While the effort may or may not succeed, the fact that we have made the top 20 shortlist is a statement of support to Maryland's business climate and is certainly welcome.","Absolutely in support.  If left to politicians, politicians as a class will support their narrow partisan interests, as they have in virtually every state in the United States.  While democracy is not always served with experts and technocrats making important decisions, on the very question of where the districts should be drawn, it is important to have a neutral and respected body put in charge of that, allowing free and competitive elections for our state and federal offices.","I think that the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights, on the whole, does an adequate job of protecting police but still allowing for reasonable investigations of police officers who are accused of misconduct.  The public largely realizes the special demands put on police officers as a consequence of their duties, including the potential to face unwarranted allegations of excessive force, and having a regulated procedure that protects the rights of police officers is fine.    My biggest concern, however, is not the law as written but how the law can be applied inappropriately to shield misconduct.  Therefore, I would be in favor of a provision that allows the Governor, if systemic problems are reported with a jurisdiction, to enact a civilian review board, that would be able in those extraordinary circumstances of questioning police officers and having access to ongoing investigations.  By having this ""emergency option"" open in extraordinary circumstances, the public can be better protected, but only if the Governor (acting on the public's behalf), feels that individual police departments have not upheld their responsibilities adequately to root out misconduct.","This is an issue that I feel very strongly on, given my experiences as a physician in the mental health field, and having dealt on a professional and personal level with many individuals addicted to opiates.  The response to the opioid crisis must be multifaceted.  In the first place, we must ensure that naloxone, the fast-acting medication that can reverse an opioid overdose and potentially save lives, is available in large quantities for first responders.  I would also strongly support having naloxone available in public buildings, like libraries and city halls, on the same basis as AEDs (defibrillators), as this will save lives.  Beyond this, we must fund more 24/7 crisis centers and have greater capacity for inpatient rehabilitation.  Often, those addicted to opioids will seek help, only to be faced with long delays in getting an inpatient bed, which in some cases can be a death sentence.  Increasing capacity for inpatient facilities as well as providing more resources for sustained remission in the community is key.  Finally, we must go after the few unscrupulous physicians who illegally prescribe opioids, as well as those who don't know better an have been prescribing opiates to treat chronic pain, contributing to this disaster.  The few pharmaceutical companies that used unethical tactics to push their medications or hide data must also be held to account, in class-action lawsuits similar to those used against tobacco companies, with proceeds used to fund treatment efforts.","The best way to reduce income inequality is by creating a business-friendly environment, strongly supporting preK through grade 12 education, and providing incentives to reduce the cost of higher education and vocational training.  Giving our children the best education possible will give them the tools to succeed in high paying jobs and as entrepreneurs, while creating the right environment for business will lead to high paying jobs.  The higher employment levels we have, the less income and racial disparities in employment will arise, and the better off everyone will be.    Of course, as a function of capitalism, there will always be some income inequality, but the smaller this gap is between rich and poor, the more social cohesion will exist and this will pay off in safer neighborhoods and prosperous communities.","I have not had any problems in accessing, for instance, the budgets for cities in my district or other published documents.  However, if there are any instances of public meetings where the public is denied entry or information requested by the public that is not released, contrary to law, then I would be a strong advocate to redress those wrongs and promptly.  The best government is an open government and if elected, it would be my honor and duty as a delegate to make sure that there is maximum transparency by state and local officials in the exercise of their duty.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

I currently serve as the coordinator for community liaisons in the Baltimore City State's Attorney's Office. I also serve on the Board of Directors for New Vision Youth Services, Inc., Empowering Minds of Our Youth, Inc., and the Asian Merchant Association. I am also a lifetime member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.","Absolutely, particularly the Commission's emphasis on using our resources to improve the equity in our education system. I believe the framework that its report outlines should be fully funded. I believe that the state can generate significant funding streams from an expanded medical marijuana industry, as well as legalizing and taxing the adult use of marijuana. This measure can also drive down the amount of money we spend annually on enforcement, incarceration, and addiction-related services on multiple fronts: every state that has legalized marijuana has seen a decrease in the level of opioid abuse that its population experiences.","The State has the resources to meet its transportation needs, but we are not spending them in a way that creates a meaningful balance between transit and roads. Many of my constituents are bus-first commuters, whether they are going to school, work, or to any goods or services they may need that day. We are not making sufficient investments in public transportation to ensure that they can commute quickly and easily by bus, let alone to provide them with other options like rail or bike. Cancelling the Red Line and treating BaltimoreLink as though it is a sufficient replacement is a perfect example of this reality. We need improved bus service AND a first-rate rail system like other cities in the region enjoy.   We can improve our transportation by facilitating more community input before changes to the transportation grid are made, and by requiring a more progressive modal split between spending on roads and public transit.","Yes, because it has been a great success in every state that has embraced it thus far.","Too often in conversations about our environment, we focus only on high-visibility assets that, though very important to protect, should not come at the expense of our focus on the quality of environment in high-density urban areas like Baltimore. We have an extremely high rate of respiratory illness in Baltimore, issues with water quality even in our schools, and continue to struggle with exposure to elements like lead. These are important problems that deserve just as much environmental attention as the Bay, but often receive much less emphasis.   With respect to the Bay, we should expand our investments in remedies that improve water quality and combat shoreline erosion while also restoring native flaura and fauna, like reintroducing more oyster beds and native grasses each year. We can also always improve the septic regulations for properties near the Bay. Truly addressing the Bay's well-being also requires a comprehensive solution to the impact of poultry farms on the shore though.","We should expand the service coverage provided under Medicare and Medicade, and do a better job of offering affordable prescriptions for senior citzens. It's also important to help ensure that people without easy access to the online Health Exchange are better able to utilize its offerings. Of course, good access to healthcare also means supporting union members who have access to healthcare through negotiated labor agreements, which are an important souce of economic power that provides for quality of life services like healthcare.","Baltimore deserves to have control of its own police department, and remains the only municipality in the state without control of its police department. State government should return local control to Baltimore, so that many of our efforts for structural reform are not required to fit in a 90-day window, and receive the approval of non-Baltimore City electeds.   The state should provide more meaningful funding for violence intervention programs like Safe Streets, and coordinate with the City's police department on clearing warrants, which is a huge step towards addressing violent repeat offenders in the City. But the state also has a role to play in addressing violent crime before it occurs, by providing equitable funding for the City's school system, and supporting higher-wage jobs and career onramps for disinvested communities in the City. One of the best tools for stopping a crime before it occurs is helping someong secure a good job and a good house.","Maryland has a strong business climate, that provides many of our residents an extremely high standard of living. Our greatest economic challenge is expanding access to those good quality of life outcomes, which means a more worker-centric approach to business. A $15 minimum wage is one of the most important steps that the state can take towards providing good outcomes for all of our residents, as are expanded investments in technical training and apprenticeships for our young persons. A family supporting job isn't just one that pays a healthy salary though; it's one that ensures that a medical crisis will not destablize someone's financial future. That's why Maryland needs to support workers who seek to make employer-supported healthcare an expectation in the state.","We cannot expect republicans to allow for non-partisan solutions to gerrymandering in other states if we are not willing to do the same here. My greatest concern is in making sure Baltimore does not lose Baltimore-only districts in any redrawing of the district maps, and that Governor Hogan is not able to put his finger on the scale of what should be a non-partisan process.","No, LEOBOR provides disproprotionate protections to the police, without providing any obvious benefits to the citizens they serve. We need statewide reform that allows 2 voting civilian members to serve on misconduct hearing boards in every Maryland municipality, and we need to decrease the amount of time between when an officer is involved in use of force on a civilian and when they are required to give a statement on the use of force. We should also require that each police department offer public reports on officer invovlement in use of force incidents on a regular basis.","Having professional training in this area, I feel strongly that we need a more health-based approach to all types of addiction, not just opioid addiction. The new crisis centers introduced under the HOPE/Keep the Door Open Act are a good start, but they are exactly that- a start. We know that having treatment centers located more proximate to those suffering from addiction helps improve the rate of utilization. We also need to fully separate the penal system from addiction treatment so that we improve the success rate of addiction treatment. Legislation passed in 2018 took a big step backwards on this front, as some offenders who suffer from addiction are no longer allowed to receive treatment outside of prison, which increases their likelihood both of re-offending and of using again. Drug courts that have a caseload focused entirely on dealing with drug-related cases is also an opportunity to improve the nuance and impact of judicial decisions in this realm.","We can improve economic outcomes by improving the equity of investments in our educaiton system, and expanding pathways to college, technical training, or apprenticeships. This requires funding formulas that better account for school districts located in disinvested communities, but it also requires debt-free or tuition free higher education for youth who experience economic barriers to continued education. We should also create stronger worker protections, be they higher minimum wages, better prevailing wage guarantees, Community Benefits Agreements that actually hold employers accountable, and expanded access to quality affordable healthcare. This also means a more just approach to our criminal justice system, so that lives are not disrupted by incarceration over low-level drug offenses or crimes of poverty, and expanding the number of offenses that are eligible for expungement and the speed with which eligibility is achieved after release.","Oftentimes, the impact of PIA laws is dependent on how well they are leveraged by media outlets that the average Marylander reads, rather than the average Marylander utilizing a PIA law in their personal capacity. Cities like Boston have made great strides forward in creating easily accessed and understood public dashboards that report on the delivery of government services though. PIA laws are an important part of the equation, but we should require the government to provide information to the public instead of the public to seek out information in the midst of busy lives, and we should require that public reporting to be done through an easily understood user interface.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

,YES,state-house,41,Dalya Attar,Attar,10/17/1990,Baltimore,Democratic,Baltimore City,http://www.dalyaattar.com,dalya.attar.9,,http://surveygizmoresponseuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/fileuploads/296249/4297291/95-4228424f23ae6e19b9e1cdc69befff5d_Dalya_Attar_-_headshot.jpg,"After attending community college, I graduated from the University of Baltimore and then from the University of Maryland School of Law.",Currently Assistant State's Attorney. Previously did private sector legal work.,"Overall, I support the recommendations of the Kirwin Commission, which was a transparent and inclusive process, and provides a strong starting point for making serious change. Some of the recommendations have already begun to be initiated, via legislation recently passed.  Universal pre-K is a key issue of my platform, and I also strongly support supplemental resources for schools based on poverty levels of students, as well as more help for special education students (an issue I have heard many local parents complain about since I started my campaign). And while I believe we must ensure that teachers are well-paid, and we provide sufficient incentives to recruit qualified, quality teachers, I want to better understand the Commission's expectations for raising the status to equate teachers with professionals that require similar levels of education.  Also, I am concerned about trying to compare other school systems (particularly outside the US) to Maryland's, and even comparing within Maryland, in different jurisdictions. While we want a globally competitive school system, we have to compare apples to apples, taking into consideration relevant socio-economic factors.  I have to review the Commission's financial report when everything is released. I await their recommendations, but am apprehensive about imposing more mandates to fund the recommendations. I support the lock-box, using casino funds for education, but if that is not sufficient, we may have to support initiating recommendations on smaller scales that are fiscally feasible, before expanding them to reach their ultimate goals.","I do not believe the state has the resources to meet its transportation needs, with demands to improve aging or failing infrastructure, while also needing funds to ease travel and transit for people going to school or work. However, with so many pressing needs that the state must fund, I believe we have to work within the budget available. As a Delegate, I would vote on transportation issues for around the state, but my priority concern will be working to get Baltimore adequate resources form the state for its transportation priorities.  As someone who has relied upon public transportation to get to work, I know Baltimore is in desperate need of greater funding for this. We have an embarrassingly inadequate transit system for a major urban city and only adds to the understand ing of why the city is not attracting and recruiting families and businesses that can help rebuild the city.  While I do believe funding should be directed to improve roads and highways, between congestion and environmental concerns, I want the state to vastly improve public transportation, creating more reliable, affordable, and faster transit options.","At this time, no. While I recognize that there is a significant portion of the population that supports it and wants it now, I have not seen sufficient research that convinces me that it will not adversely impact our communities.  I believe we are heading in the direction of legalization, but there is a need for additional research before I can make a proper decision on recreational marijuana, particularly with concern for the danger of people operating vehicles under the influence. There is an abundance of concerns related to the responsibilities and recklessness of drivers today, and we need to better ascertain the impact of marijuana on judgment, reaction, and coordination for drivers. Many do not understand that marijuana use can be as dangerous and harmful as the influence of alcohol.  We are just at the threshold of medical marijuana use, and I believe we need to move forward towards recreational use legalization with baby steps.","The Bay impacts the entire state, including bay-related industries (i.e. crabs, tourism), our water, our wildlife, etc. Congressional activity can affect the Bay, and we must ensure that everything in the power of the state legislature protects the Bay, particularly if federal changes are made.  Many of my district's residents understand how cleaning up the Bay is important for the Baltimore Harbor, but do not understand the broader impacts beyond the shoreline. We must do more to educate Baltimore City residents on how their lifestyles and behavior can affect the Bay, and that ""saving the Bay"" is not just about what happens by the shoreline.  Going forward, we must work to ensure that we do not miss deadlines imposed on clean up efforts. Also, next year Phase III Watershed Implementation Plan will be submitted. We must make sure it properly and thoroughly addresses the issues and provides solutions, and that recommendations will be implemented.  While we have long-term programs in place, there are constant changes that demand ongoing reviews and monitoring. With potential cuts at the federal level, Maryland has to be prepared to find other avenues of funding or to alter priorities in environmental efforts. The legislature must address funding shortages based on reduced federal funding; for example, the recent Omnibus bill did not include funding for reef restoration in the Bay, which creates uncertainty in oyster restoration now. While there may be temporary funding from the Congressional discretionary funds, we need long-term funding solutions for the Bay.","We need to create solutions that are not from a band-aid approach of temporary fixes.  I know how important affordable health care is, because after I was married and already a mom, at one point I didn't have health insurance. I went to sleep at night in the winter fearful of a child getting sick and being unable to afford to take him to the doctor or buy him medicine.  No Baltimore City family should be without health care, not because it lowers costs for everyone if healthy families are also on plans, but because it is safer and more protective for families to have the insurance. Just as car owners need to have car insurance, I believe health insurance is vital. However, owning a car is optional (if you cannot afford insurance, you do not buy a car), and we need to explore alternatives to the individual mandate, which most people I speak to are opposed to.  And we must address access to treatment. For example, many needing mental health care are forced to outlay costs, and whose without funds available to pay up front (and get reimbursed later) do not get critical treatment. While we are combatting drug abuse over the long term, the health impacts must be addressed. That's why, for example, I support programs like needle exchange, which will reduce hepatitis and other health problems, for users.","The 2 key roles the state should play are in enacting legislation and providing funding. It is critical to ensure that laws are passed that will penalize dangerous and violent criminals, gang members, and human traffickers. We must also ensure ensuring that the state sentencing guidelines for violent repeat offenders are sufficient. This past legislative session saw some good laws passed, and those efforts will need to continue in the next Session.   Moreover, Baltimore City needs state funding, although the spending decisions should be made by Baltimore City politicians.   With Baltimore City's Mayor and the Council seemingly determined to attack the violence crime issue, I strongly believe we should give them a chance. However, should we see spikes in violent crime or ongoing high murder rates, I would potentially support using the National Guard to help provide added protection and security.","Maryland's business climate is improved and steadily improving. I believe that people have confidence in the business climate, and feel more secure at their jobs or that there will be alternative work opportunities in the near future.  Most of the complaints include the need to continue to reduce regulations, ensure higher wages, and bring more jobs to the State. As a Delegate from Baltimore City, I will work to improve the business climate by pushing for more career and skills training, to offer a better workforce.   We need to explore some of the work policies that increase productivity, such as maternal and paternal leave. And to ensure that while we work towards high wages, businesses don't make human employees obsolete and replaced by machines, without retraining them for other work.",Absolutely.,"Initially designed to protect law enforcement, today many believe that it overprotects them, at the expense of the public.  For example, Maryland has had several scandals involving prison guards and staff, but the Law Enforcement Officer Bill of Rights impeded the investigations. And with continuing problems and scandals developing in police departments, the public needs confidence that they are not overlooked in these matters.        The LEOBR should be adjusted to ensure that police and other law enforcement are not receiving special treatment, and at the same time ensure that those who violate the LEOBR are penalized, not rewarded as it may be perceived now.","100 years ago, Baltimore lost around 3000 lives to the influenza pandemic, as the country faced a major crisis. They thought it was unstoppable, but they worked to stop it. We must have the same attitude towards the opioid crisis – leaving no stone unturned in the battle.  We have to properly fund, treat and prevent addiction with a collaborative and united approach. At the prevention level, this includes both education to youth, rec centers and other activities that will work to divert them at the social level, as well as education to adults about the dangers of addiction following medical procedures. Prevention also includes legal action and great publicity against unscrupulous doctors and others who intentionally play a role in increasing addictions, as well as harsh penalties on street level drug dealers.  At the treatment level, this includes needle exchange to prevent additional health risks; particular focus on inmates and those with mental health issues that lead to or increase opioid use; and funding for treatment centers (particularly in appropriate areas).  I do believe we need more funding from the federal government.  Ideally, while at the state level we must work to demand more funding from the federal government, and to ensure that proportionate funds are directed towards Baltimore City, I believe that the city officials and City Council should play a leading role in direct distribution of the funds to proper programming.","While I think that much of the income inequality issues need to be addressed at the municipal level for Baltimore City (both in terms of prioritization in the distribution of funds as well as proper oversight and accountability of the spending), at the state level we can ensure that there is sufficient funding for programs that can give lower income families greater opportunities.  For almost a year, I have been calling for universal pre-K and free community college tuition, and I was pleased to see that legislation did pass on these issues; there is somewhat of a start on this, even if it is not to the full degree needed. I was also pleased to see funding this year to provide more child care in Baltimore City, so mothers (and particularly single mothers) can have greater ability to work. Other proposals and legislation to provide stronger education and skills training, including more funding towards schools in areas with higher poverty rates as well as training for careers to provide greater work opportunities, will make a difference as well.  There is a lot more that needs to be done, and it is concerning that much legislation to address income inequality was done in an election year. Baltimore City cannot wait another four years for its representatives to focus on additional income inequality issues.","I do not believe that Maryland properly provides its citizens with the ability to exercise oversight of the government, nor do I believe that most legislators are genuine in wanting to improve transparency in Maryland.  The recent activities by the Maryland legislature to determine things in back, smoke-filled rooms without access for the public demonstrates some of the transparency issues in Maryland that are not favorable to the public.  And considering that Maryland in 2018 is one of a few states lacking live stream video of the General Assembly, this also prevents the public from proper oversight and fair access to the workings and activities of the government.  It should be very simple: the government is here to work for the public - we pay their salaries, and in some cases we elect them. The arrogance in believing that they do not have to give us access, the ongoing closed-door meetings held at local and state governmental levels, and the inability of Marylanders to know what their government officials are doing is a problem that is concerning and must be changed.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

,YES,state-house,13,Vanessa Atterbeary,Atterbeary,6/24/1975,Fulton,Democratic,Howard County,,pagesvanessa-atterbeary306282889049,vatterbeary,http://surveygizmoresponseuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/fileuploads/296249/4297291/179-ec7538474b0a31081c876ebd19c65fc1_Del_Atterbeary_Pic.jpg,"The College of William and Mary, B.A., Government, 97' The Villanova University School of Law, J.D., 00' I attended Howard County Public Schools and graduated from Atholton High School in 93'.","I currently serve as Corporate Counsel for KRA Corporation, a company dedicated to workforce development and whose headquarters is in Fulton, MD.  I began my career as a law clerk for the Honorable Judge David Young in Baltimore City where he presided over juvenile cases.  I then worked as an Associate at Bulman, Dunie, Burke & Feld, Chartered where the majority of my practice was family law.  I later worked as an Assistant Attorney General for the District of Columbia practicing defensive civil litigation.","Yes, I support the Commission on Innovation and Excellence's findings in Education.  In particular, I believe that the state should do everything it can to implement quality early childhood education for all of its children.  As a mother of three young children, I am experiencing firsthand the substantial cost of pre-kindergarten!  During the 2017 legislative session, I sponsored emergency legislation that created a workgroup to study how to deliver pre-kindergarten to all of Maryland's children.  Since then, the workgroup has reported its recommendations to the commission.  I am committed to funding reforms that ensure the recommendations of the commission are fully implemented.  The General Assembly passed legislation during the 2018 session ensuring that gaming revenues are not diverted from education and other legislation that begins implementation of the commission's recommendations.","No, Maryland's transportation spending is disproportionately balanced to funding road projects rather than transit.  While current transportation funding is being spent building road projects on the Eastern Shore and in Western Maryland, transit projects for Central Maryland have not been funded.  Howard County, a direct link for commuters to Baltimore and Washington, has been ignored.  The cancellation of the Red Line and creation of the BaltimoreLink is a direct signal to Baltimore that its residents don't need a contemporary transit system.  Funding on transit projects for Baltimore and Central Maryland is critical to get people moving to and from jobs.  The Red Line would have connected Baltimore residents with more opportunities for employment outside of the city, reduced the carbon footprint, congestion and traffic on the 95, 695 beltway corridors and surrounding roads.  I have supported legislation dedicated to transit projects and will continue to support the same.","I support a thoughtful approach to the legalization of marijuana.  Legalization of recreational marijuana will affect federal job employment, the largest employer of Maryland residents, and other types of employment where marijuana use is prohibited (ie. caretaking, teaching, driving, transit drivers, etc.).  We must ensure that any legalization of marijuana policy does not perpetuate a culture that adversely affects the poor and people of color.  The latter includes participation in the industry.","The Chesapeake Bay is a valuable resource for all Marylanders.  I remember doing class projects in the 8th grade at Clarksville Middle School geared towards ""saving the Bay!""  Currently, the federal government and governor are attempting to roll back measures that Maryland has taken to protect the Bay.  I will continue to resist their efforts.  I have supported legislation in the Maryland General Assembly, and will continue to support legislation, that reduces storm water runoff, help farmers to reduce soil and nutrient runoff from their farms and educate Marylanders about how to manage polluted stormwater runoff due to the use of fertilizer.  I supported the Oyster Sanctuary Bill during the 2017 legislative session and the Forest Conservation Act during the 2018 legislative session.  Unfortunately, the Forest Conservation Act did not pass the legislature in 2018; however, I will continue to support this legislation.","During the 2018 legislative session, I supported legislation that helps the rising cost of health care immediately and offers a long-term solution to stabilize the market.  This session, we were able to pass legislation authorizing Maryland to re-coup approximately $380 million in suspended federal money from insurance companies to pay for a state reinsurance pool and require a study of long-term solutions for the insurance industry and stabilize market rates for Marylanders.  Maryland should continue to examine the benefits and implementation of a single payer healthcare system and a state-run reinsurance program.","In 2017, Baltimore's homicide rate reached record numbers with 342 murders.  During the 2018 legislative session, there were 7 murders in Baltimore the weekend before Sine Die, as the Maryland General Assembly debated crime control aimed at Baltimore.  Removing illegal guns from the hands of violent repeat criminal offenders is critical to protecting the citizens of Baltimore as well as continuing to invest in programs like Safe Streets.  I supported a measure during the 2018 legislative session that accomplished the latter.  Further, a serious and honest look at examining education and job opportunities for Baltimore residents moving forward is necessary.  Businesses must invest in the city to help job creation.  Education, jobs and transportation infrastructure are important factors in lifting cycles of generational poverty that leads to criminal activity.","Businesses and people move to Maryland to benefit from our public school and higher education systems, quality of life and proximity to jobs in the State and D.C. metropolitan area.  The state must continue to invest in our public and higher education school systems and invest in transit so that people can get to quality paying jobs throughout Central Maryland.  Passage of the $15 minimum wage would be a step in the right direction for Maryland to help families.  Currently, many teachers, public safety workers, single parents and working young adults cannot afford to live in the counties in which they work.  This is particularly true for individuals working in Howard and Montgomery Counties.  Passing a wage that is actually livable is key to helping individuals take care of their families and live close to home.  Maryland should continue to invest in the biotech and cyber-security industries to become less dependent on the federal government as an employer and to expand our business base.  In addition, the General Assembly passed the More Jobs For Marylanders Act of 2017, creating apprenticeships, tax credits for employer participation and job creation for manufacturers.",Gerrymandering has been largely supported and accomplished by the GOP and that is reflected overall in the current national political climate.   Maryland's representation in the General Assembly is reflective of the political demographics in the state.  I support an independent body to draw legislative and congressional district maps after each census.,"During the 2015/2016 Interim, I was appointed by Speaker Michael Busch to the Public Safety and Policing Workgroup which held public hearings, studied and proposed changes to the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights.  I also serve on the House Judiciary Committee which has heard public hearings on this issue during this legislative term.  The workgroup was a direct result of what happened to Freddie Gray in Baltimore City and how the legislature could address the fractured relationship between the police and the community.  Since that time, the Department of Justice has investigated the Baltimore City Police Department and found that the department had engaged in a ""pattern and practice"" of discriminatory policing.  In addition, the illicit and illegal conduct of the Department's Gun Trace Task Force has come to light.  It is clear that the City's Police Department has its challenges and there is a lot of work to be done in re-building and re-branding the Department and creating trust with the city's residents.  I support citizens, who have been trained and have an understanding of LEOBRA serving on the City's trial boards for the purpose of transparency.  As it stands now, the city's trial boards are open to the public to attend.","This session, the General Assembly took steps to address the Opioid Epidemic, a public health crisis, that Maryland is currently facing.  Escalated funding was established in a competitive grant program to local behavioral health organizations expanding crisis response programs and services (ie. mobile crisis teams, 24/7 walk-in services, crisis residential beds, and other crisis response programs). In addition, legislation was passed that requires pharmaceutical drug companies to file reports of suspicious orders to the Attorney General's office.  Maryland needs to make significant strides in funding to increase the number of available beds for drug treatment under the Justice Reinvestment Act.  In addition, mental health funding needs to be increased and we need to ensure doctors and dentists don't over-prescribe.","The income inequality problem in Maryland requires addressing many issues. During this session, the legislature passed legislation increasing child care subsidy rates so that low-income parents can have greater access to high quality child care.  The legislation requires the governor to increase funding for the Child Care Subsidy Program over several years.  As a working mother, with three young children, I know first-hand how difficult it can be to afford quality child care.   In addition, the state must increase the minimum wage to $15 per hour so that families earn a living wage, expand pre-kindergarten so that all of our children have an opportunity to be successful when they start school and invest more funding in transit in Central Maryland to get people to and from jobs.","Transparency and accountability are important to maintaining an open government.  Citizens should have access to information, the process and the ability to participate if they so choose.  The General Assembly passed the Public Information Act Compliance Board in the 2015 legislative session and further strengthened Maryland's open meeting laws through legislation in 2017.  I firmly believe in transparency, accountability and the ability to participate which is why I sponsored HB816 during the 2018 legislative session.  The legislation, which passed the General Assembly, revamped the handgun permit review board's process so that it is transparent and open to the public.  As such, the board can now be held accountable for the decisions it renders.  I will continue to support measures that strengthen these laws.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

I currently serve as the Chief Policy and Engagement Officer and General Counsel.,"I strongly agree with the initial findings and recommendations of the Commission, but many of the recommendations will take a long time to have an impact; in Baltimore, our kids need us to do better now.   As a former high-school teacher, I know implementing change across a school is hard, let alone doing it across a district or a state. In the Commission's report, a lot of attention was paid to career ladders for training principals and teachers, but little time was spent discussing long-term principal development. We know that dynamic principals can change the way a school operates, especially in Baltimore's decentralized system. We ask our principals to be more than administrators; we ask them to be social workers, activists, and community organizers, yet we invest little in their development after their second year. As a result, our attrition rate after 3 years is untenably high. A visionary, supported principal can better support students and teachers and can lead grassroots improvement in our schools with community organizations, local foundations and non-profits, students, and parents.   Paying for the Commission's recommendations and my proposal above will take significant investment, but we need to recognize that investments today in education and career readiness generate long term savings in the near future in the criminal justice system, health system, and lost wages and taxes. Adjusting the funding formula to account for need and poverty will almost certainly require reductions in budget for wealthier jurisdictions, and I'm ready to fight for that investment.","Baltimore's transportation system leaves quite a bit to be desired, even after the advent of BaltimoreLink, and many have to take two or more busses to access jobs, healthcare, social services, and education. Though the Red Line was cancelled, we need a comprehensive vision for public transportation across the region, inclusive of rail. We have to focus on investing in transportation solutions that increase access. Investments like this need to be funded through city/state collaboration and include federal dollars where available. I will advocate for creative funding solutions, like TIFs, be made available for solutions that increase access for our residents.   One opportunity is to connect the West Baltimore MARC station, which provides train access north and south and serves as a bus hub, to the Lexington Market Subway and Light Rail lines. A reliable light rail could be built in the existing highway to nowhere at a relatively low-cost and would connect much of West Baltimore more reliably to jobs downtown and points north and south of the City through the light rail and subway.",Yes.,"The Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure and important resource and I am committed to working to find ways to improve its health. We need to support efforts to bring natural filters like oysters and aquatic plants back into the region and reduce both urban and rural storm water run-off while reducing pollution. These not only reduce pollution but create high-quality jobs.  The 40th District, like much of Baltimore, lacks green spaces and is largely paved/impervious, which allows pollutants and trash to flow quickly into the Bay. I support programs that reduce storm water run-off and its effects such as bump-outs and conversion of paved lots and vacant blocks to green space. We should also continue to ensure that all state-sponsored development and infrastructure projects use best practices and technology to minimize the effect of run-off.","Maryland has led the way in increasing access to affordable health care, but we need to ensure absolute access to care across the state and across the spectrum of need: we need to move Maryland to a single payer system. More than that, we need to continue to build a robust system of behavioral health care, specifically by ensuring 24/7 access to critical behavioral health services in all corners of the state.  Importantly, however, less than 20% of our health is defined by what happens within the walls of our doctor's office. Social determinants of health, including housing, food access, and employment, play a major role in the health of our residents. Investments in education, housing, food access, and employment will lead to better health outcomes.","The state has a responsibility to protect its residents and a responsibility to be a part of the solution to violence in Baltimore. Investing in programs like Safe Streets is important, as is supporting implementation of the Consent Decree. But like health, drivers of crime are complex and require more than a police solution; opioid addiction touches almost every family in Baltimore, and joblessness, homelessness, and poverty fuel disconnectedness that drives crime. The state can and should play a role in addressing not only the immediate precursors of violence, but the more attenuated inputs.","Maryland's business climate is friendly, and often the state and local government provide compelling tax incentives to lure and keep business and investment in the state. Where we struggle is in developing a competitive workforce across the board, and we especially need to invest in vocational programs, apprenticeships, and trades. Maryland has incredible colleges and universities, but we don't do a great job as a system of meeting the needs of people who don't want to go to college.",Districts should be drawn based on exclusively on proportional representation. We cannot allow gerrymandering to perpetuate politics as usual and disenfranchise our most vulnerable.,"There are significant issues with policing nationally and in Maryland, and the Baltimore Consent Decree shows it. We have to recognize that we ask first responders to put themselves in danger as a matter of course, many of them without a second thought. But we need civilian participation on review boards. We have to end racism in policing and restore the public's trust in law enforcement.","Baltimore City, through its Health Department, has built an innovative, nationally recognized strategy to combat the opioid epidemic that focuses on saving lives with naloxone, increasing access to treatment, and fighting stigma. We need to support their work and expand it across the state. The price of naloxone remains too high for expansive distribution and there still isn't sufficient access to treatment. More than that, we need to ensure that people can access treatment as soon as they're ready, without having to wait days or weeks for appointments. We need to ensure that treatment is available in diverse venues so that people in our jails have access to evidence-based drug treatment programs while they're incarcerated and immediately upon release.  Addiction is a chronic disease and treatment exists, and we need to stop criminalizing the disease.","To start, we need to increase the minimum wage to $15. Wage growth for low-paying jobs has been virtually non-existent when accounting for inflation, and Maryland has to ensure workers across the state are paid fairly. A wage hike to $15 an hour will certainly have consequences, and we need to be careful to protect small businesses. To do so, we should provide small businesses with tax credits and reduce the amount of payroll taxes due, the cost of which could be offset by the increase in income taxes. Though this won't completely even the cost for business, it can significantly lessen the burden while putting higher wages into the pockets of workers.","Both laws are helpful but do little to provide an opportunity for meaningful community input and engagement. Being informed isn't the same as being involved, and the responsibility to engage stakeholders lies with government agencies, to be held accountable by elected officials.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education? Are you committed to funding associated reforms, and if so, how?","Is Maryland’s transportation spending appropriately balanced between roads and transit?

I am a playwright and an artist, and have a theatre production company with my husband. I also am Assistant Camp Director for a summer camp in Bethesda.","I support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education. We have to take a long, hard look at who we want to be as a state, and to decide how we want to invest in the future of our children. I have long said we need to change the narrative which stigmatizes and devalues vocational education in lieu of college and instead we need to make an equal investment in both. I am also committed not only to universal early education but in arts integration at every stage of education. Additionally, we have to tackle the epidemic of poverty which is plaguing our students not only in the schools with universal pre-k and kindergarten and free lunch programs, but with broader state programs such as public transportation and affordable housing and child care, and community investment to deal with the root causes of poverty. We need comprehensive solutions which address the underlying causes of poverty and by addressing them on multiple fronts, we create access to multiple funding sources.","For too long Maryland has failed its residents on public and mass transit. Many communities are inaccessible without a vehicle, many residences are isolated from each other, and many low income communities are disenfranchised in Maryland by a lack of public transportation options. Even with the expansion of BaltimoreLink which is a great improvement over our previous mass transit, Baltimore is still disconnected from Washington, DC, and Annapolis. Public transportation has a tremendous knock on effect not only for access to employment, but also to access to affordable housing and  voting, and accounts for an improvement in quality of life for seniors, low income communities and youth ages 13-16 who do not have access to reliable transportation for employment or extracurricular activities. Public transportation also reduces traffic on roads and highways resulting in decreased commute times, lower incidences of accidents and reduced driver frustration.","It is difficult for me to turn my attentions to the legalization of recreational marijuana when we are still struggling in District 33 and Anne Arundel County to build the medical marijuana facilities which have been legally allowed since 2014, repeated denying children with epilepsy, youth, adults, and seniors suffering from chronic pain, cancer patients trying to thrive despite debilitating nausea caused by treatment access to medically prescribed marijuana. I am angry that we are talking about legalizing recreational marijuana throughout the state yet licensed medical marijuana facilities in our county cannot get variances to build in Anne Arundel County yet variances for development are offered at an unprecedented rate, including variances to allow permitting without public hearings on development projects.","Maryland needs to strengthen our multi-state coalition to ensure not only that they are committed to keeping the Chesapeake Bay on the path to restoration but also that we will be sharing resources to continue the advancement of the Chesapeake Bay. Additionally, we need to establish a Beautify the Bay initiative to renew pride and commitment in promoting the restoration of the Bay and to reward efforts and innovation for organizations and individuals who develop new technology and/or clean up efforts for the Chesapeake Bay.","I have been evaluating the multiple approaches to securing and shoring up the Health Exchange as well as the push for Single-Payer Health Care on both the local and national level. We have made advances with prescription drug price gouging legislation and the drug cost commission. However these are simply short term legislative extensions not long term solutions. I am a huge proponent of Medicare for All but I do believe it needs to begin on the federal level because without a federal mandate, states which cannot afford to establish single payer systems will be left behind. I feel it is the job of government, whether federal, state, or local to be an equalizer and innovator and Maryland needs to remain a leader however if we cannot solve this on the national level, we will have to work for a permanent solution at the local level.","I grew up in and around Baltimore during the time of the restoration of the Baltimore waterfront. The rise in crime, particularly violent crime in Baltimore is and should be a statewide concern. We need comprehensive solutions to address not only the level of violence but the root causes. The state needs to actively work towards ending the opioid crisis, domestic violence, systemic racism, and generational poverty which contribute to the rise of violent crime. Additionally we have to address the rising costs of housing, child care, health care and the additional effects of poverty which make success in the educational arena particularly challenging as well as the failure to shore up educational facilities and provide the resources necessary to thrive. Additionally we have to look at community, law enforcement partnerships which address the loss of confidence that many minority communities are suffering which puts both the community and law enforcement in jeopardy rendering de-escalation additionally challenging. The state has a great deal of power in establishing programs to deal with the multiple consequences of poverty and under-employment. Finally we have to work to attract small, locally grown businesses in Baltimore to ensure that there is adequate employment options for residents and that moeny stays in the community.","One of my great frustrations is the near constant narrative which says we are either pro-business or pro-family, because these are not mutually exclusive.  We have to ensure not only that we are creating a business friendly environment with tax incentives and investment in industry but that we are creating a working family friendly environment by holding businesses accountable to the well-being of their employees,  with adequate child care options, health and retirement benefits and equal pay for equal work.","One of the reasons I am proud to be a Marylander is that Maryland has been a leader on the national stage, in environmental protections, gun reforms, civil rights advocacy, so many have asked why I wasn't a greater proponent of an anti-gerrymandering bill. I am a proponent of fair districts, and favor a non-partisan, independent body to draw legislative and congressional maps, but if we want to be a national leader for fair districts, then we should want our case to make it to the Supreme Court, where we will lose, as we should, thus creating a precedent on the national stage. So yes, I support a creation of a non-partisan body, in preparation for the Supreme Court decision which will likely and hopefully call for fair, equal, non-partisan districts and I look forward to utilizing this independent body after each census.","I think it might be time to reevaluate the validity of the Law Enforcement Officers Bill  of Rights not necessarily because it isn't adequate but because there is a serious loss of confidence in local law enforcement within communities throughout Maryland, particularly minority communities. Law Enforcement shouldn't be vilified or hamstrung but it would be disingenuous to disregard the very real concerns of the divide between law enforcement and the community. It is time to create a coalition between law enforcement, state representatives and community leaders to reestablish a line of communication and change the language of the Bill of Rights to ensure not only the officers are protected but that communities feel protected as well.","There is no one right strategy to address the opioid crisis. We have to attack it on multiple fronts, from education programs at the elementary, middle and high school levels, to holding medical facilities accountable for the over-prescribing of drugs. We have to decriminalize drug use and work with incarcerated communities to establish a comprehensive program for treatment and release which encompasses not only drug treatment but practical concerns such as job placement, child care, and financial services so recent parolees aren't incentivized to return to using. We need to create community schools and centers to offer education and activity options and we need to change the narrative to acknowledge that drug abusers come in all shapes, sizes, and economic strata.","We need comprehensive solutions to address income inequality. Maryland is a leader in many areas but we still have work to do. Legislative solutions, though important do not address the full impact of income inequality because it isn't simply about the paycheck, it is about the bottom line. If we want to address income inequality, we need to look at the cost and access of childcare which disproportionately affects women, public transportation which addresses the issue of access to employment and other resources, affordable housing because too often people cannot afford to work where they live and live where they work, and incentives for diversity in hiring to create growth opportunities for minorities.","Transparency in government is a particularly frustrating issue within Anne Arundel county. Often it appears that private interests outweigh public access to information and to scrutiny. Having seen the frustration of our community who have been left on the wrong side of the door at what were meant to be open meetings, I do not feel these laws adequately ensure Marylander's ability to exercise oversight, as we have seen multiple examples where public oversight was eliminated until the plans were drawn and the permits were signed.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

I support any recommendation for a better educational system where we attract the best of the best of teachers and we put resources in our schools to ensure our children graduate with excellence and can compete in the job market.   I am committed to funding and once I get to Annapolis and I am more in the know of the funding availability in the budget, I will be able to assess how to pay for it. However, I will commit funds to positive growth programs like this.","From what I know, Maryland's spending is not appropriately balanced. It seems like more funds go towards highway construction than public transit. I believe the State could meet its transportation needs if they allocate funds in the appropriate way.  Although I am not as verse with issues pertaining to Baltimore, I don't believe Baltimore is adequately served by transit. It appears that the State has removed transit opportunities from communities that are in desperate need of public transit. As a result, these communities are at a great disadvantage.","I believe in the legalization of medical marijuana because there are many people who need it to help with severe pain.  As to recreational marijuana, although I may not personally agree with the use of marijuana, I believe that legalizing marijuana may be a moral requirement because so many non-violent people are locked up and their lives forever changed and not for the better.  I also believe that as reports have shown, legalizing marijuana will also bring in revenue to the State. However, we have to ensure that the fall out is not over use of it causing negative effects on our young. Therefore, if it is legalized, we must put in regulations to ensure our children are protected.","We currently have a public contribution effort that has been successful. We need to enhance and that program, not necessarily change it, but let the public know that federal funding for most programs like the Bay are not Washington's priority and emphasize that we must and will take ownership of the future of the Bay.","Healthcare is a right and as such everyone should have access to affordable health care. I believe that having the Maryland version of the Affordable Care Act is the right way to go. In that way, we do not have to worry about Washington does because our residents will be protected.","The state should look at the root cause of all this violence. Studies upon studies have shown that poverty has a direct link to violent crimes in some of our neighborhoods.  There is a clear correlation between the two. I believe that creating an environment where disenfranchised neighborhoods have an infusion of resources for education, economic development, mental health services, employment, etc., a lot of the issues we see will start to slow down.  Additionally, law enforcement needs to foster a working relationship with the neighborhoods and build trust with the community members.  Police should have proper resources to properly use community policing that is culturally sensitive.","Although there has been an increase in business registrations, that doesn't necessarily mean we are doing well with attracting businesses.  However, Maryland could also be said to have a competitive market in a sense that there is opportunity for innovation and also opportunity for growth.  The state needs to invest in our young population. We need to create more innovative spaces to attract our young entrepreneurs. A recommendation would be having innovative spaces by things like the Purple Line. These could be what differentiates us from our neighbors. This would help young families grow and have job security because of the innovative times we are in now.","At this time, I will not recommend any real change. I will need to do more study on this subject.","It's not fairly balanced because it seems to be heavy on the training side and not as much on the community policing side. It needs to be more balanced because even if police are extremely trained, the problem with community policing cannot be solved by training. We should make a change and focus a bit more on the community and developing a trusting relationship between police the residents they are to protect.",This crisis is heart breaking and the State must take the lead on addressing this issue. The State should proactively provide access to NARCAN to save lives and ensure that all emergency vehicles have it available when called in. We should then focus on educating our communities about these drugs. I agree with the move we are making right now in trying to hold the drug manufacturers responsible for the crisis.,"Start with equal pay for men and women. We should pass $15 minimum wage. Provide early childhood education and child care, especially for single mothers. That would go a long way with helping families. Index early childhood care based on the local jurisdiction to determine the need based on CPI (consumer price index) of the local jurisdiction.","It is good that meetings are held publically and the meetings are posted.  However, the problem is that the meetings may need to be held at a time when most residents can attend. As it stands, accessibility of the government meetings by most residents is almost non-existent because most people cannot make the meetings at the times they are held. Therefore, I don't believe that Marylander's ability to exercise oversight of the government is adequate.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

As a life-learner Sarahia Benn has studied American, African American & International History, theology, philosophy, psychology, and sociology.","Sarahia Benn is a community organizer, Pro musical director/producer, educator, and entrepreneur.","I do support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education.  I am committed to funding the associated reforms they have found. How can we provide funding? As a legislator I will first discontinue cutting the education budget so it can at least get back to prior levels of funding. Then we need to create multiple approaches to generate revenue such as 1. create an MVA educational license plate similar to the bay tags; 2. a state income education surcharge; 3. a state sales education surcharge; 4. a state education surcharge on medical marijuana use; 5. selling advertising in state-run universities & community colleges campus venues; 6. selling logo wear similar to PBS; 7. creating an education funding credit card similar to a capital one card where for every purchase a donation is made to the educational fund...;8. total funding reform to address funding inequities to ensure all public schools have the same resources; 9. advocate federal legislators to create an education reinvestment fund to address crumbling school infrastructures which will also address school safety issues that exist due to America's schools resembling 1950's technology, architecture, and functionality.","MD's transportation spending is not appropriately balanced between roads and transit.  The State does have the resources to meet its transportation needs however the State keeps taking from the funding.  No, the Baltimore region is not adequately being served by the current transit plan. I have friends who have stood outside for hours for a bus to not arrive or not have any viable way to a job without alternative personal vehicles. Being from NY originally elaborates the need for Baltimore to upgrade and integrate its public transport system within Baltimore and all its surrounding counties.","Without the complete understanding of the pros and cons of legalizing recreational marijuana, I can't say I support or am against it.  It's apparent that the war on it has not worked in any capacity and according to your own report, 60% of Marylanders support its legalization. If marijuana is eventually legalized I would support the revenue be directed towards our crumbling infrastructure, educational reform/safety upgrade, school infrastructure,  transportation upgrade, and environmental movements to clean energy independence.  As a prospective legislator, I would be inclined to change Maryland law to allow ballot initiatives and allow the voters to vote on it. This issue is too polarizing to be left up to legislature alone to make the decision in my assessment.","Septic systems contribute increased levels of nitrogen pollution. The MDE proposed regulations to not only retrofit septic systems but require that new & replacement septic systems have technology that reduces nitrogen & phosphorus discharges by half or more, along with sediments, which would restore the health of the Chesapeake Bay & reach water quality standards by 2025. District 34A/MD transportation system requires a massive upgrade. I want to propose a policy to address it titled ""Clean Climate Upgrade Initiative fee."" Greenhouse gases cover many different industries. Different industries would contribute more to reducing GHG through the initiative than others, some sectors such as electrical can be priced from the beginning while other sectors such as transportation can be assessed a fee so as not to overburden them by the regulation. To encourage MD transportation systems to upgrade to clean transport there may be grants/loans provided to account for some of the costs of upgrading to clean transport for a specified (X) amount of time & a specified (X) maximum amount of a tax break. Pricing: This legislation will establish a formula for the fee to evolve over time to account for inflation & deflation in the economy. The revenue fee would be used to help repair impacted communities, offsetting the new burdens placed on consumers, producers, & the broader economy due to the upgrade, provide clean energy alternatives research funding, & provide a concerted campaign to encourage & show the benefits of energy industries to upgrade to Clean energy alternatives.","I support single-payer health care, Medicaid expansion, and no cuts,  instituting transparency rules for Pharmacy Benefit Managers and drug corporations as well as creating a drug cost review commission for high-cost drugs which would allow less expensive prescription drugs be accessed by all (though it would affect seniors the most). I believe that in the richest nation, solving the issue of healthcare is a matter of viewing how it is interconnected to the quality of life and productivity of the community – not through the lens of divisive and vitriolic political rhetoric. If you're too sick to work revenues are lessened. Healthcare is a right if we are to actually live out the words of ""life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."" My parents fell ill and without affordable healthcare, I had to become the predominant caregiver and breadwinner for my sickly parents – a reality that is becoming all too often the norm in America, where children of sickly parents receive very little assistance or help. Add that District 34A has been ranked as one of the many areas in America that are struggling with opioid and other drug addictions, yet quality and affordable healthcare still remain elusive for far too many a solution on the State level will be necessary because the Fed legislators have not been able to fix it.  I have a plan to help caregivers and Marylanders that find themselves in the gray areas of the law to gain better and consistent healthcare.","The State should play a role in helping Baltimore address violent crime but not through requiring mandatory minimums and school to prison pipeline policies. Violent crime in Baltimore is a product of lack. Lack of resources, lack of quality and equitable education, lack of food, lack of health, inadequate and insecure housing and services, lack of stable environment....just plain lack. Poverty is the chief reason crime remains prevalent in urban areas as shown through Karl Alexander, Doris Entwisle,  and Linda Olson expansive 25-year study culminated into 2014 book called, ""The Long Shadow: Family Background, Disadvantaged Urban Youth, and the Transition to Adulthood."" The sobering and simple conclusion is the poor remained poor; those better off remained better off.  Until the State helps to address all the lack and instability within these community economies in Baltimore expect that the illegal crime economies to continue to flourish and violent crime to remain prevalent. The State needs to provide opportunities for these communities to flourish utilizing empirical data as opposed to divisive and vitriolic rhetoric to drive policy.","Maryland's business climate is good and bad. It ranks the lowest in tax considerations and in the top 20 for costs, labor supply, regulatory environment, growth prospects and quality of life aspects. I support fair lending and fair wages. Many Marylanders with good credit scores cannot get lending at the banks they've held accounts at for decades. MD must move towards a supporting community banking models to make lending options more available, affordable, and fairer. Current community banking lacks scale, technology, and regulatory expenses are spread amongst a smaller base. By helping community banks address these issues Marylanders who desire to be small business owners can access the lending they need to create businesses that pay fair wages to those in their communities. Maryland's business climate will only increase when small businesses are given opportunities to thrive because there is a limitless base of talented entrepreneur's within Maryland. I am not hostile to corporate interests at all, however, data shows that small businesses are the life's blood of much of American economy.   I also believe that local Chambers of Commerce must begin to include all populations in all their communities to be a part of helping to create economic growth plans. Local Chamber of Commerce's has to do a better job at informing the larger public that they are there to help all of the constituency to be a part of progressing economy.","The problem with independent commissions is that they are created by legislators at the time which creates issues and in some cases can cause them to be powerless. Independent commissions will not be free from political influence due to this and other reasons. I think many of the ideas surrounding forming an independent commission is great however we have to install legislation that works from numerous angles and be able to be updated as the population fluctuates to achieve our desired result of less political influence. So I'm not against independent commissions at all but they have cons that would need to be addressed. If addressed they could be a good tool in addition to legislation. But remember redistricting is heavily dependent upon a census system that's somewhat voluntary, has numerous operational faults, and again not free from political influence based on who has the helm so we need to take that into account as well.  I also support creating a State voter's rights law similar to the Federal voter's rights act that has been weakened in the past decade. It will address many of the issues such as gerrymandering and voter suppression and would not be dependent upon the Feds altering or reducing its strength. I also support automatic voter registration because we need opt-in programs not opt-out or not even having options to register. Marylanders should never be denied the right to vote. We should be encouraging Marylanders to vote.","The law enforcement officers Bill of Rights needs a few alterations such as the 10-day non-contact stay which provides for the accused officers to not be interrogated or forced to make a statement, unlike other Marylanders who would be forced to make a statement the same day. The Bill of Rights allows for a ""special layer of due process"" for officers not afforded to other Marylanders which impedes transparency, accountability, and demonstrates a clear lack of just and fairness towards the general Maryland constituency. But the real solution to balancing protections for the police and the public stems from a process and protocol issues. Police officers are being investigated by the same departments they are in which creates all kinds of conflicts of interests for the investigating officer, prosecutor, and even the investigated officer. The State must propose in law the creation of independent prosecutors and investigative agencies that would address all cases of police & other public officials misconduct to assure the public and police officers that transparency and fairness will be implemented from start to finish.   I'm sure I'll take heat for these statements from some because it seems addressing this issue is all or nothing, however, I have spoken with many retired officer who agrees it's the process and protocol in these investigations that are the most prevalent issue that undermines public trust. I believe fairness for all parties involved should always be the resultant. Slight alterations to the Bill of Rights and creation of an independent agency will help to ensure that.",1.

After completing my MSW in 2013, I worked in Alaska for three years as a mental health therapist. I have been a doctoral student and research assistant since moving to Maryland in 2016, and recently have also begun teaching masters level social work students.","I think schools should be the foundation of our society and strongly support the education reforms of the Commission. Children, parents, and educators should have everything they need to thrive. My initial ideas are to fund these reforms with new taxes on items like recreational cannabis, employers who automate their workplaces, and polluting corporations. However, if I were part of the team of legislators implementing the plan, I would want to research funding mechanisms much more thoroughly.","For some people, public transport is a convenience in addition or instead of a vehicle. Yet for many other Marylanders, it is a necessity, and our state has not focused on investing in public transit the way it should. Not only do many individuals suffer as a result of the kinks in our system, we also all suffer on a larger scale since we miss out on an opportunity to unite different regions of our state, which many could benefit from. We have the resources, but we need the political will to bring back the Red Line, properly serve Baltimore's residents, and expand public transit in all areas of the state.","I support the legalization of recreational marijuana for many reasons. First as a civil liberty issue, a criminal justice issue, and as a moral issue. The ""War on Drugs"" has devastated communities of color and done little to stop crime. Meanwhile, states like Colorado and Washington have been thriving and collecting millions in taxes on their upstart cannabis industries. In Maryland, we can use this tax revenue to improve education, rebuild roads, and support the transition to clean, 21st century energy technologies.","We need to guarantee that funding for the Bay is protected at the state level, but we can do more. We can also transition to green energy, work to lessen the amount of excess nutrients in our water, promote oyster sanctuaries, and ensure that polluting corporations pay their fair share to preserve our environment.","I am absolutely in support of any legislative efforts that will expand healthcare access and affordability for my neighbors. Ideally, the United States will move towards a universal single-payer healthcare system. In the meantime, I would be thrilled to support single-payer within our state or expand Medicaid to people of modest incomes. We could also look at creative legislative solutions - such as an incentive for employers to provide it for their employees or offer a subsidy to individuals who need it - if the funding can be secured. If we have the political will, there is a way!","While doing research assistance at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, I worked closely with the Safe Streets program. In that time, it was incredible to see effective this program is. Our legislators can provide support for programs like Safe Streets and other evidence-based solutions that lower crime and save lives. Additionally, it is my firm belief that we should be looking to the root issues of violent crime (which I believe to be systematic issues like poverty and lack of affordable housing.) Our legislature should NOT work to implement tough on crime legislation that will exacerbate the problem and worsen our state and people.","To be honest, I do not know much about Maryland's business climate. I am still working full time so in the time I have allocated to researching possible policy solutions, I have focused on areas like education and the environment. I think this would be a good place to acknowledge that I am a person who knows her limitations, believes in science, scientists, and researchers, and gladly relies on experts so she can make informed decisions. I will never pretend to know something I don't.","I absolutely support the creation of an independent body to draw legislative and congressional maps. This should be a fair and scientific process. Maps should be fair, no matter the map maker.","We are not unique in being knee deep in the pursuit of trying to restore the relationship between police officers and community members here in Maryland. From what I have read, the Bill was created in the 1970s and could use update in several areas, such as the excessive force complaint making process, a chief's ability to discipline an officer, and the waiting period an officer has after an incident before they're required to be questioned. I have several close friends and colleagues who have served in jobs which put their lives on the line and I have the utmost respect for anyone who has chosen such a path of service. Yet, officers' needs must be balanced with the dignity of community members and the injustices so many are experiencing on a daily basis. It seems to me that more can be done. Again, in truth, this is not an issue I am very experienced with, so if elected and working on relevant legislation, I would call in experts to help create the most well informed, and just, changes possible.","One legislative change which could be a ""game changer,"" is safe consumption sites. While allowing people to freely consume illegal substances in a given area sounds counter-intuitive, this initiative has taken place in cities as close as Philadelphia. These sites have been found to bring down the number of deaths as a result of less overdoses. These sites usually are accompanied by access to resources like counselors and public health staff. Additionally, initiatives like this could actually save the taxpayer money in the long run as a result of less incursion of associated overdose costs (ER visits, ambulance trips, etc.) I also support Dr. Leana Wen's lead in Baltimore City. I think NarCan (the life saving medicine that is easily transported and given out) should be available to all public service officials and also over the counter without a prescription. It also seems wise to invest more in substantial treatment options.","I believe wealth inequity to be the defining issue of our time. Our state should remain deeply committed to progressive tax policies, investments into education, ""smart on crime"" policies (such as Safe Streets and getting formerly incarcerated individuals to reintegrate into society smoothly), infrastructure renovations to help reduce the burden on - and give good jobs to - our working families. We absolutely should follow through in 2019's legislative session on raising the minimum wage to a livable one and work towards tuition-free higher education and universal healthcare as well. Lastly, we need to protect our safety nets since they are constantly being attacked on the federal level by individuals like my US House Representative, Andy Harris. Programs like SNAP, Medicaid, Medicare, the EITC, and housing assistance help people meet their basic human needs. Our great state should resist the urge to enact time or work requirements. These have been found to be ineffective and put even more burden on people living in poverty. Instead, we should help them lift themselves up.","From what I've read, we could be doing more to ensure that the information received as a results of these laws is properly given consideration. As this is not an area I am overly familiar with, I would need to review more information to have an informed opinion. However, as with almost any issue, I'm open to reviewing and discussing it.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

I served as National Secretary for the Young Democrats of America Minority Caucus, and President of the Linover Community Association, and was appointed by Cathy Bevins to serve as a member of the Baltimore County Pedestrian and Bicycle Advisory Committee.","Yes, I support the findings  and recommendation on  investment on early childhood education, ample supply of highly qualified and diverse teacher, college, and career readiness pathways, more resources for at -risk students, Governance and accountability--  as it convincingly explain the argument of  achievement gaps in education have been a complex, multi-dimensional, and ongoing phenomenon of American society that operate under the veil of an egalitarian ideal of the nation.  Unfortunately, the scalpels of racial and religious rhetoric few politicians  have been wielding in the national political stage deeply cut peoples' faith, sex, and identity and spew more hatred among each other. Without instilling a sense of character and equality on a national and state level stage, the attempt to change classroom culture would remain elusive.","I don't think there exists a proper balance between funding of roads and  transit.  In this light, it is imperative to have a fine balance between the two, and areas with a more dense population deserves better access to mass transit, as it will reduce traffic congestion of major intersections, and can help people get to work promptly (Increasing workplace productivity and saving lost time and gas money). I think we have the resources and finances to meet the transportation needs, but we  lack efficiency in allocating the funds. By finding better companies to do more time-efficient work at the best quality we can make roadways like the 695 corridor and highways between Baltimore and Washington run more smoothly and safely. The creation of the BaltimoreLink is a first step towards a larger goal. We need to expand on the ""Link"" system, and make all areas of Baltimore accessible to every citizen that can be translated into reality by efficiently funding transportation  rather than wasting taxpayer dollars.","Colorado and other western states have made strides to recreationalize marijuana, and it has affected the states in many positive ways. Firstly, recreational marijuana has reduced the number of opioid related deaths and prescriptions being made for these drugs. This can help combat the opioid epidemic that our state faces, as it could very much have the same effect reducing the number of addictive opioids going to patients and the streets. Secondly, there has been an economic boom in the states with recreational marijuana, and Maryland could benefit from this. By using the recreational marijuana taxes we could help better fund transportation when it comes to roads and buses, as well as, allocate more funds to our education system.  For example, we can use this fund to build new schools, give raises to teachers, and provide all students access to the resources they need to learn. In a nutshell, we should explore the recreational industry in Maryland, and I will support legislation to do so. However, we must perfect the medical marijuana industry in the state before we make laws for recreational one. Perfecting the medical system will make a transition to recreational marijuana that much easier.","The EPA is no longer doing it's duty protecting the Chesapeake Bay in this current administration, and that not only frustrates me, but many citizens across the state. The bay is one of our biggest sources of income, as it not only is used in the fishing industry but transportation as well. We need to allocate funds to help us better protect Maryland's most vital waterway, and in order to do that we need to either create new methods of funding or cut the pork legislation in Annapolis. Cutting the economic waste in the state can help us reduce the amount of waste in our bay, protect wildlife, and reduce boat pollution. We need to have stricter laws on dumping waste done by companies, because without federal EPA standards and consequences in place, the companies freely  dump waste. By creating new forms of revenue-- example through recreational marijuana, cutting unnecessary spending in Annapolis, and imposing stricter laws on dumping-- we can save the bay and commit to it unlike the federal government.","Maryland should open itself to all competitive  healthcare markets, and make access more available. We need to come up with laws in Annapolis that protect companies from increasing premiums and deductibles for lower income residents, children and seniors. In Annapolis, I will stand up for our health. I will fight to protect Medicaid and Medicate for working families and seniors.","Education is the surest weapon to combat the violent crime. Therefore, government  has to support  Pre- K for all and lowering tuition so every family can afford to send their kids to college.  We need to focus  investing more on afterschool  programs and  on  vocational schools for carrier readiness;  colleges are not best options for everyone.  Expanding pre-K is more than a noble goal. It is an investment with the potential to produce benefits that far exceed its costs.  Those parents whose poverty takes away the future of small children are in dire need of home-based and non-home based child care and early education center. In this respect it is imperative that like-minded organization partner to provide educational and developmental support to children and families. The longer a child from a poor background goes without formal preparation for school the worse he/she will perform literacy and other cognitive skills along with social skills in future. In a demanding decade where just parental love and affection may no longer be enough, the entire society must emphasis on skill-development-- cognitive and physical health, character, independent, self-confident, school-readiness-- at an early age for the universal dream of better life that  expand the American dream.  The  quality educational foundation is a strong first step for the growth of all students across all academic and social measures.The challenges, thus, continue for all those involved in making sure educational equality remains a tool for greater achievement and opportunities for all students to combat violent crimes.","In order to strengthen our state's business climate we need to stop the over-development by corporate America. Instead of continuously building when there are many homes and business unoccupied, we should stop developers from taking over, and have them utilize already existing buildings. Constant over-development has plagued communities around the county and state, and we need to ensure that we do not cater to developers more than the constituents we serve. According to a current community survey, in district -8,  there are approximately 3,500 vacant housing units. We should come with ideas in re-invigorating economic activity and inviting new families in vacant properties. Moreover, small businesses need stronger protection against a large corporation and hassle free access to government services.","Gerrymandering, on both sides of the aisle has poisoned America's trust for fair elections not only in National elections, but also in State and local  elections. Continuing to Gerrymander the state to ensure that one party remains in control does not reflect the true spirit of democracy on which this nation was built upon. Fair elections, where one party isn't packed into a small district where they will not be represented to the fullest, is the direction the state of Maryland should go. Creating a true bipartisan team to redistrict Maryland fairly is only viable solution to move forward  from the polarizing gerrymandering of the past. Ensuring everyone in the state is properly represented is one of many goals I hope to accomplish as district 8 next delegate.","It is imperative that the current Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights(LEoBR) should be amended so that each of the public servant should be held accountable for their action.  In this respect, the current LEoBR  prohibits civilians oversight over police action and makes authority to bring bad officers to justice.","To combat the opioid and overdose crisis in Maryland we need to take several steps to help the addicted and stop the drugs from reaching the streets. We need to prevent medical professional from over-prescribing opioids, as over-prescribing leads to more and more people getting hooked on these drugs without a proper way to get off of them. With very few doctors who take you off these drugs slowly, more people are becoming addicted without a way out. By stopping over-prescribing, and focusing on prescribing to those truly in need we can reduce the number of people affected by opioid's addictive grasp. Stronger laws that penalize these drug dealers need to be put in place, that way we can punish the people who have caused addictions and deaths in many families across the state. Perhaps even moving toward medical or recreational marijuana can help reduce the opioid issue, as states like Colorado have seen a significant drop in opioid related overdoses and deaths since the implementation of recreational marijuana. There are many ways we can help ease this issue, its just about investing in smart strategies to combat opioids.","There  is every reason for optimism and to smile when we look at the policy changes and its implementation and growing achievement of gender equality just looking around overtime. The longer-term, optimistic perspective on gender equality which creates income inequality, however, will have its deep roots in economic prosperity and independency of women. In addition to the gender justice of few outrider women on the top, the mainstream debate must address increased insecurity at the bottom end of the spectrum and time females spend doing unpaid work including childcare and cleaning as a part of family responsibility. A vast majority of women  still faces huge inequalities. As a society, we all need to tackle gender inequality that has direct connection with income inequality to create just and prosperous society.","I strongly support state's Public Information Act and open meetings laws as it grants citizens access to public records and information from open door meetings. It creates  transparency and makes government accountable to the citizens.  To make the system run more efficiently, we need to put the non-digital data record onto a digital file accessible to all citizens. By creating a digital record we can stop the unnecessary searching for data, and make access to information the fastest it can possibly be.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

Bolen,Bolen,1/21/1963,Ellicott City,Democratic,Howard County,,,,http://surveygizmoresponseuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/fileuploads/296249/4297291/99-932f7ce8a5697404c36106f35c70118a_Steve_HeadShot_JFP_19MAR2018.jpg,"I hold a Doctorate's Degree (Ph.D.), Master of Science (M.S.) Degree, and Bachelor of Science (B.S.) Degree in Electrical Engineering.","     I am a 27-year veteran of patriotic, dedicated Federal Service, and have taken an oath to protect and defend our democracy, our freedoms, and our American way of life. I have proven leadership working at executive levels and have demonstrated my ability to form coalitions of high-performing teams - across global enterprises, to successfully meet the challenges that have faced our nation.             I am an engineer and scholar and have earned a doctorate's degree in electrical engineering. I have published in professional journals, reviewed numerous technical publications, served as a panel co-chair for a professional engineering society, and have been invited to speak at international conferences and to participate as a scientist in international, earth-science field projects.","              Education is a powerful investment that we can make in our future; and, one that we cannot ignore. It is smart economics - it develops a skilled labor force that is important to our long-term prosperity and economic success, it builds a stronger more productive society, and it creates opportunities for socio-economic advancement.            	I stand behind sensible, holistic policies to bring excellence to our schools and that address solutions that work for our children, parents, teachers and our communities. I support the findings of the Kirwan Commission - we need to close the opportunity gap, support families with young children and special needs children, and recognize teachers as highly-skilled professionals. We also need to ""Lock-In"" public school funding.         	It is essential that we provide our schools with fair, stable, reliable, predictable, and diverse sources of funding - funding that politicians can't touch, so that we can build a world-class educational system that is second-to-none.","As a long-time commuter through our metropolitan area traffic I know first-hand the difficulties and frustrations that many people face - that is, spending too much time trying to get to where you are going instead of being there. Access to efficient, affordable, and safe transportation is essential to our economy, our environment, quality of life, and opportunities for advancement. Unfortunately, the current state of our transportation system is not keeping pace with our regional socio-economic needs. And, the reality is that no one solution will solve all of our transportation demands.          I support a multi-tiered policy that manages demand, increases the capacity of existing systems, and that integrates humans-in-motion, private and public transportation, and transportation for hire modes. We need to control demand by building, revitalizing, and connecting our communities in ways that create efficient access to the places we need to get to; and, we need to improve infrastructure capacity to reduce the amount of time it takes to get there.          Finally, we need to re-imagine how we think about transportation, land use, and links between different modes of transportation that are driven in data-centric ways to create a system that is affordable, environmentally friendly, sustainable, adaptable, and that can grow to meet our changing needs.","       First, we need to separate out the discussion between marijuana and hemp. One of the world's oldest cultivated crops, industrial hemp has insignificant values of the THC compound that produces the psychoactive effect found in marijuana. Industrial hemp is an ecologically sound crop with beneficial, hard-to-ignore properties that has use in the rope, textile, paper, insulation, construction, health food, and composite materials industries. As such, I support the cultivation and commercial uses of industrial hemp.     	Medical marijuana is already legalized - at least for limited use, in Maryland and a majority of states and the District of Columbia. I support the Maryland Medical Cannabis Commission and their efforts to ensure that medical marijuana is available to qualifying patients; and, in their role to exercise oversight of licensing, registration, inspection and testing to measures specific to Maryland's medical cannabis program. I also support further research into medicinal uses and efficacy of medical marijuana.       	I believe that recreational use should be regulated, taxed, and enforced in much the same ways we do alcohol and tobacco. There should be age restrictions on purchase and consumption, restrictions on public intoxication - such as while operating a motor vehicle, boat, or firearm while under the influence, potency control; and, for public health and safety, there should be appropriate oversight on growers, processors, and dispensaries.","        The Chesapeake Bay is the country's largest estuary.  It is a natural resource that is important to our nation and our state's heritage, ecology, economy, commerce, and recreation.  As such, it is our responsibility to protect it, preserve it, and keep it clean. We need to hold the federal government, other states, and local Maryland governments accountable when they fail to enforce mandatory provisions of federal, state, and local environmental statutes, acts, and laws.      	A significant source of nutrient pollution in the Chesapeake is from nitrogen oxide that enters the Bay caused by air pollution from out-of-state power plants. During hot weather, this pollution also contributes to the information of ozone near the Earth's surface threatening the health and well-being of Maryland citizens. Yet, the EPA has failed to act to compel upwind states to install and use the same air-cleaning technologies that Maryland requires for plants within our state.     	When the federal government fails in its role to exercise proper environmental stewardship of our environment - such as not enforcing the ""good neighbor"" provision of the Clean Air Act, or rolling back the Clean Power Plan, Maryland must act on its own. We need to empower our Attorney General to sue federal agencies to ensure compliance with environmental laws; and, we must expand, and enact our laws like the Healthy Air Act and Forest Conservation Act.","        Maryland has already started down a sound path to creating an effective, broadly accessible healthcare delivery system that will reduce costs to businesses, patients, insurers, Medicare, and Medicaid. For nearly 40 years Maryland's Health Services Cost Review Commission has set hospital reimbursement rates in what is known as an ""all-payer, rate-setting"" system. That means that hospitals must charge the same price for services to everyone regardless of what insurance they carry. This system has created the lowest rate-of-growth in hospital costs of any state in the country.     	Recently, tweaks to the system gave hospitals a global budget that didn't change based on the number of admissions. This has incentivized them to keep the health system focused on keeping people healthy instead of just treating illness. Prevention and wellness programs that encourage health outside the hospital, eliminating unnecessary tests, and the use of case managers to connect patients to primary care is the emphasis.     	I support looking into ways to expand the all-payer system to a broader patient population, grouping patients together to negotiate prices, providing chronic care management outside the hospital, and using data-centric approaches to provide actionable care coordination among caregiver professionals.","      To reduce violent crime, we need to find solutions that address our communities as a whole and create equal opportunities for everyone to succeed. We need to break the school-to-prison pipeline, reduce the recidivism rate, and help families struggling to make ends meet.     	We cannot simply abandon our youth once they graduate from high school.  We must help them transition from public education to become productive citizens in our communities.  They need good jobs and marketable skills to obtain those jobs. We need to help them identify career paths and job choices before they graduate from high-school and provide them with continuing academic education or vocational training and with job placement after they graduate.     	Before inmates can re-enter society, they need training and education to give them updated, job-ready skills. They need rehabilitation through anger management, addiction treatment, mental care, or other services. But, most importantly, after release, they need jobs, continued treatment care, and safe, affordable housing.     	Working families need help with childcare, job advancement through continuing adult education and retraining, access to high-quality jobs, affordable health care, healthy food outlets, shopping, and safe, affordable housing.","     Maryland has one of the highest household median incomes in the country and one of the lowest poverty rates. It has a highly skilled, well-educated workforce and spends more per capita on research than most other states.  But, despite this, our economy is falling short of its growth potential, and venture capitalists still prefer to make investments in companies in Silicon Valley, New York, and Boston.     	Large concentrations of poverty exist in Baltimore City, Somerset County, and elsewhere in Maryland. These areas are inclined to have higher levels of crime, poor schools, run-down housing, public health problems - and, lack of jobs, healthy food outlets, and recreational facilities.     	I support pro-growth policies that encourage small - and, minority-owned, business development and that builds entrepreneurship within communities; and, family-friendly policies that ensure living wages, stable work schedules, workplace leave to attend school activities, and that support continuing adult education and retraining for job advancement.","I strongly support an end to partisan politics in drawing federal, state, and local districts. An independent panel should be formed to draw district lines that are fair, balanced, and unbiased. Furthermore, the panel should be transparent in its methods, determinations, and with the data it uses.","      Police officers bear an enormous responsibility in our communities. We grant them unique authorities needed to carry out their jobs, and we place our trust in their integrity and honor in discharging their duties. It is right that we hold them to the highest standards of accountability and ensure that they respect us and our civil liberties.      	However, if we are to attract and keep the finest officers - and, make sure they are an effective element of our public safety, then we must also support them, give them the tools they need, and protect their civil liberties as well. That does not mean they should be afforded special privileges outside the law not given to any other citizen. But, they should be allowed due process like any other citizen.     	We need to find solutions that keep our communities and police engaged in ways that promote mutual respect and trust. We need to attract and hire a police force that reflects the diversity of the communities they serve, provide officers with quality technical training and ethics-of-profession training, expand police outreach programs, and promote and advance officers with good leadership and demonstrated ethical character.","           According to a report released in January by the Maryland Department of Health, the number of opioid-related deaths has nearly doubled since 2015.  To combat opioid addiction, we need to explore programs that emphasize prevention, emergency care, and treatment.          	I support prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) that track the prescription and dispensing of drugs to monitor use and prevent over-prescribing, and programs that provide safe, responsible, convenient ways to discard prescription medicine. We should expand laws - such as professional immunity and third-party possession laws, that will allow broader public access to the lifesaving drug naloxone; and, we should provide long-term, sustained treatment of addiction disorders through medication-assisted treatment combined with counseling and behavioral therapies.         	Additionally, I am encouraged by the recent announcement to open a ""stabilization"" center in Baltimore to care for people under the influence of drugs and alcohol. This first-of-its-kind center in Maryland will take the load off of emergency rooms and combine medical care with community-based behavioral and social services.  It represents a critical step forward to providing improved treatment options for people struggling with substance abuse. We also need to make sure that follow-on assistance is available to transition people from intensive rehabilitation programs toward personal independence.","             According to some experts, income inequality in the U.S. is on the rise. As the divide gets sharper, it will further segregate our communities into the ""haves"" and ""have-nots.""   The result will be the concentration of wealth, power, and influence into fewer hands opening up the potential for greater social injustice.         	I support public policy and legislation that will expand economic opportunity in low-income communities. We need to create entrepreneurship within disadvantaged communities and help low-income people and their communities build and retain wealth. We need to help our youth and provide them paths to higher education, vocational training, and job placement after they graduate from high school. We need to ensure that everyone has access to affordable healthcare - including mental health care, addiction care, and prescription drugs. And, finally, we need to make it easier for families to afford safe, stable housing. One way to do this is to allow all lawful income to be used to determine rent.","           The purpose of the Public Information Act is to make sure that we all have the right to find out what our government is doing. I am running on a platform of transparent, responsible government. I believe that it is the solemn duty of our government to listen to us, to work for us, and to tell us what it is doing. That is the promise that all of our elected leaders are supposed to make, and one they need to make sure all levels of government keep.      	Except to protect legitimate state interests, individual privacy, or records exempt by law - such as attorney-client privileges, information should be readily available, and public records should be posted on the internet. A Compliance Board should be established to ensure government compliance and consistency in response to requests and denials, hear complaints and assess violations, and to make sure fees are level and fair.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

,YES,state-house,40,Terrell Boston-Smith,Boston-Smith,3/4/1982,Baltimore,Democratic,Baltimore City,http://www.terrellbostonsmith.com,tbostonsmith,tbostonsmith,,"I was born in West Baltimore, and raised there by a single mother with the support of my aunts, uncles, and grandparents. I attended Baltimore City Public Schools, James Mosher Elementary School, Mt. Royal Middle School, Walbrook Sr. High for a year, and graduated from Baltimore City College High School. I earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Political Science from Franklin Pierce University in Rindge, NH. In May 2012, I was named a National Urban Fellow at Baruch College –City University of New York, where I earned a Master's of Public Administration degree.","I am a former small business owner and public affairs consultant. I more recently served as the Campaign Manager and Political Director for Brian Frosh's successful campaign for Attorney General of Maryland. Following the campaign, I served as Special Assistant to Attorney General Frosh in the Maryland Office of the Attorney General. I began my career in the Retail Investment Group of T. Rowe Price Associates and at the Baltimore Community Foundation.","I am highly supportive of the initial findings and recommendations of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education and look forward to the release of the Commission's final report.  There is no issue more important to the future of the 40th District, and the future of Baltimore, than equity and excellence in public education.  It cannot be stressed enough that high quality public education is our most important tool for securing the futures our children need and deserve.  It is our strongest crime prevention strategy. It is our best economic development tool.  I believe that some of the initial recommendations of particular importance to residents of the 40th District are:  added weights in the state school funding formula for high poverty schools; universal access to pre-k education for all four year olds and for low income three year olds; a strengthened approach to Career Technical Education (CTE); and proposed increases in teacher pay and the addition of school counselors psychologists and social workers.  I am committed to working with other state legislators to identify funding for these proposed reforms, even as we await further recommendations on funding from the Commission itself, and I support passage of the ""Fix the Fund"" initiative that will be at the ballot box in November.  I believe casino and other gaming revenues could provide a strong source of funding for increased investments in public education, as new funds as initially promised to the voters, not backfill to state dollars that were spent elsewhere.","Much to the detriment of residents of the 40th District, Maryland's current transportation spending is heavily weighted towards roads ahead of transit.  As a result, many of the City's neighborhoods with the highest commute times, and highest poverty rates, are grossly underserved.  And we know the devastating impacts on these communities.  The Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance found a strong correlation between the commute time of City residents and unemployment, poverty and life expectancy.  And we know that State transportation spending is at the core of these problems.  Indeed, the Central Maryland Transportation Alliance found a striking imbalance in proposed State transportation spending--less than half a billion dollars for the Baltimore region, as compared to $11.7 billion for the Washington region. When Governor Hogan canceled the RedLine and redirected state transportation dollars to roads in Western Maryland, the InterCounty Connector and additional lanes along 270, not only did he rob Baltimore to subsidize suburban sprawl, he helped perpetuate the deep structural inequities that trap our City's residents. .     So what can we do about it? Should I be elected, I pledge to join with my 40th District and other legislative colleagues to advocate for a rebalancing of State transportation resources with a clear focus on public transit, reducing commute times and connecting residents to jobs.","I am encouraged by the conversation around equity in marijuana licensing and business ownership that has begun in Maryland and I support the legalization of recreational marijuana.  Public proceeds from the licensing and use of legal marijuana could provide an important new source of start-up and investment capital for small businesses in economically distressed areas  -- like the 40th – across the state.   Imagine such a fund, if you will, as a whole new take on Weed and Seed—community efforts to weed out violent crime, gang activity, and drug use and trafficking while seeding those same neighborhoods through social and economic revitalization.","Though there is much to be done, I see two immediate steps Maryland should take to protect the Chesapeake Bay and accelerate the recovery of this awesome and vital resource.  First, Maryland should continue its strong advocacy role vis a vis any proposed changes in federal policy and funding that threaten the Bay.  Our congressional delegation stood firm in ensuring that ongoing funding for Bay cleanup was included in the federal omnibus spending bill. My mentor and former boss, State Attorney General Brian Frosh, has joined with other states' Attorneys General to protest the Trump Administration's proposed repeal of important clean air and clean water provisions. We must keep up the fight.  Second, we must invest in modernizing our storm-water infrastructure. In the 40th District, for example, Jones Falls is often deluged with sewage runoff, so much so, that there are permanent signs warning of the health risk. This is unacceptable.  The City is struggling to make planned infrastructure improvements and needs the State's help and support.  A healthy Chesapeake Bay is important for all the citizens of Maryland, not just those communities that directly touch the Bay, and protecting the Bay is the responsibility of all.","Maryland has made important bipartisan progress in shoring up access to health care amidst the assault on the Affordable Care Act.  I fully support actions taken during the current Maryland legislative session to identify new revenue (via a tax on insurers) to stabilize the individual insurance market.  Moving forward, I believe we must continue to protect access to care by making such fixes permanent and fill any remaining gaps in coverage.  The Maryland Medicaid waiver, a landmark effort which has held down the cost of care and returned significant savings, provides a promising opportunity to do just that.","In his ground breaking work on place and opportunity, the Harvard economist Raj Chetty found that being born male, low income and in Baltimore had a net negative effect on lifetime earnings of greater than 25% (27.9%) --the largest negative effect among all jurisdictions in the country.    There is no question that the State must help Baltimore address violent crime. The State's role has nothing to do with instituting mandatory minimums or driving up the number of our citizens who are incarcerated. If we want to address violent crime, we have to expand economic opportunity.  Key to addressing violent crime in Baltimore is restoring confidence in the police, deterring violent actors, and dramatically expanding economic opportunity.   In these areas, State government can help by: ++ Returning control of the police department to the City so that there are clear lines of accountability in instituting needed reforms mandated by the Policies and Practices review by the U.S. Department of Justice and the resulting Consent Decree.  ++ Implementing an external review of the Gun Trace Task Force and the lack of scrutiny they received via the special commission proposed by Senator Ferguson and as approved by the Maryland Legislature.   ++ Scaling evidenced-based violence interrupter and deterrence programs such as Safe Streets.  ++ Fully funding the Kirwan Commission recommendations to improve educational equity and excellence; and  ++Expanding effective job training like the Maryland EARN initiative (sector-based workforce training that leads to career track job in growing areas of the Maryland economy).","Maryland has an excellent business climate.  We're home to any number of growing businesses with special strengths in health care, biotechnology, cyber security, information technology, transportation and logistics and maritime industries.  Our challenge isn't the presence of thriving businesses, it is the uneven distribution of them and their benefits.  In addition to strong growth in technology sectors state-wide, we must also foster the development of small businesses that are an engine for job creation and they employ local residents. That's why I'm committed to business creation and expansion in economically depressed areas like the 40th District.  If elected, I would focus my efforts on expanding and leveraging state resources for small business start-up and expansion – more neighborhood businesses that will hire more neighborhood workers.","Yes, if fair and balanced.  Gerrymandering is a very serious problem that threatens the very core of democracy. I will support a redistricting process that is and work to ensure that it is fair. However, I believe that we must also work toward a national solution to ensure we don't further weaken progressive power at the federal level.","No.  Currently the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights puts protections for police officers ahead of those of the public and should be amended.  Advocates have been working since at least 2015 to make amendments that would include citizens in conduct reviews, make officers available for questioning as soon as a complaint has been filed (and eliminate the current waiting period), and extended the time for allowable citizen complaints of officer misconduct beyond a one -year statute of limitations.   All of these seem like common sense reforms to me, could serve to strengthen police-community relations and bring some needed balance in protections.  I'm for them.","For as long as I can remember, the stated policy intent in Baltimore has been to provide drug treatment on demand (that is within 24 hours of a person's expressed interest in entering treatment) and of a modality evidenced to appropriately address the presenting person's condition. Yet, we continue to fall far short of this goal.  Now that the plague of opioid addiction has well and truly spread beyond the city's boundaries, my hope is to find state partners – and state resources – to finally meet this goal. We also need to fight to secure ongoing funding for the purchase and use of naloxone so that all first responders – and other community members who seek to be trained in its administration – can save lives.  And though I need to learn more about the current status, it seems as if much of the recent spread in opioid use stems from an initial addiction to prescription drugs.  I'd like to work with the medical community to try other effective treatments for pain before opioids are prescribed. Finally, opioid addiction in Baltimore is – and always has been – an expression of a some deeper despair the cure for which can only be found in an expansion of opportunity – opportunity for an excellent education, a family supporting job and to live safe from fear.","The state can and should take on income inequality.  Income inequality is the result of our policy choices.  Other policy choices can be made to redress it.  Indeed, we are already paying for the high costs of income inequality – and particularly race based income inequality – in mass incarceration, juvenile detention, foster care and in treatment for preventable diseases.  A better use of Maryland's resources would be to fully fund the Kirwan Commission recommendations, consider additional wage supplements (like a universal minimum income that is being tried in Stockton, California) and work with the business community to increase the minimum wage to $15 per hour while moving quickly to implement paid sick leave.  These immediate actions, along with others that could even out regional disparities in concentrated poverty through new development in distressed neighborhoods and the support and expansion of housing mobility programs to neighborhoods with good schools and access to jobs, would be a great start.  We do know what to do. I'm ready to get busy doing it.",I spent some time looking at this issue in my role as Special Assistant to the Attorney General.  It is my opinion that Maryland's Public Information Act and open meetings laws ensure Marylanders' ability to exercise oversight.  Where we fall short is in the faithful execution – the implementation – of these laws and provisions.  We need effective oversight of the oversight provisions.  Strengthening the Public Information Act Review Board with increased staff would be a good place to start.,"Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

Allow teachers to teach instead of teaching to tests. Encourage all forms of educations (public,private,online,and homeschooling.) Enhance vocational and trade skills training not just College. Make public schools competitive allowing parents a voucher to use. This Commission wants to increase spending  by$1.9 Billion. This results in more bureaucracy in our Education system, but not necessary in better results for our children.",Long record of support for transportation improvements I was lead sponsor of four 8th District Streetscape projects.) Will not support increases in gas tax. Transportation Trust Fund has enough money for worthy transit projects not new state programs. Need to evaluate the metro bus system for cost efficiencies. Make sure the Trust Fund lockbox is not raided.  I do believe that we need to look at the future to make sure we have adequate transient systems.,"No, I do not support legalization of recreational marijuana. I have no problem with it's use for medical reasons.  Recreational use can lead to the use of heroin and opioid painkillers as has been the case in Colorado .  My concern is you will have people driving cars, operating machinery etc. and  this could cause severe harm to those around them.  Personally, I have seen the results of recreational marijuana use  in my family.","Challenges I consider important (Chesapeake Bay, Energy Development, Bee population survival). Reducing the impact on the environment is crucial. Stop seeing people as separate from nature or necessarily  harmful to the environment. Allow citizens the freedom to choose how to live, but accept the responsibility to pay to keep the environment clean. Using a cooperative and property-rights-based approach to solve problems, and resort to regulations only when it is the only effective option. This is a better solution than government mandates that rob our citizens of their right to own  and use their properties.","Our health-care system needs big reforms to bring down costs and improve access to care. The question is how do we change it? Part of the answer are market-based reforms, which will inject real competition into the marketplace, improve quality of care, and ultimately drive down costs. The truthful answer to better care is a market system that puts the patients first and not the government in charge.","The State has the responsibility for the public safety of it's citizens and to  insure confidence in the criminal justice system.  The Governor needs to partner with city leaders to help develop strategies in dealing not only with violent crime but lesser crimes that often leads to a life of violent crime. The State should work with the city to develop a corrections mission statement. Help  with locating assistance and resources  that are available by foundations and federal agencies. Look at what other states have done with modernizing  sentencing strategies. Lawmakers in Kentucky  have facilitated court involvement to reduce the recidivism rate.  In 2013, risk and needs assessments were included in presentence reports, allowing  judges to review a defendant's likelihood of future criminal behavior in considering different sentencing options. In Virginia, the courts use risk assessment to identify nonviolent offenders for community supervision, rather than prison, when appropriate.  Create economic development zones where citizens living in communities that are affected by  violent crime  have opportunities to create wealth and jobs that pay well.  Support programs that help stabilize and support the Family structure.","Private sector job growth was double the national average. Maryland's economy is stronger than it has been in years. According to Baltimore economist Anirban Basu ""This economy that has been picking up momentum in 2017 is going to pick up even more momentum in 2018.""  The job growth of 2.2 percent outpaced the national rate of 1.4, and ranked the state sixth for job growth. My concern is how we go about giving incentives to businesses (being careful that we are not picking winners and losers, and not creating corporate welfare). Our goal  needs to be a market approach by creating a level playing field for all. One way  to accomplish this objective  is by eliminating onerous regulations that plague small business along with streamlining the permit processes. This frees up capital that they can use for innovation and better wages.  Reducing  the tax burden on businesses is also very  important in helping  overall the business climate.",It is very important that Communities should not be so divided. There are communities that have so many representatives that it makes it difficult for citizens to know whom they should call when a problem arises. The process of redistricting should be placed in the hands of an independent commission with all stakeholders represented.,"The problem with policing is how do we regulate police authority to allow officers to enforce the law at the same time protecting civil liberties and minimizing social costs.  The state grants authority for police officers to restrain in order to reduce fear, promote civil order, and pursue criminal justice. Many times officers are faced with making split second decisions when faced with very difficult situations.  This makes for a complex situation in disciplining or removing bad officers, including but not limited to those who have been convicted of felonies in the courts. The Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights at this time does adequately balance protections for police and the citizens.","The opioid overdose epidemic is a major threat to the public's health. The misuse and abuse of prescription opioids are complex problems requiring a comprehensive and educational approach.  The legislature needs to respond with  guidelines on the responsible use of opioids.  Like what they did in Ohio, we need to adopt the following guidelines:  A) Emergency Department/Acute Care Facility Opioid Prescribing Guidelines, B) Opioid Prescribing Guidelines for Treatment of Chronic Pain, and C) Opioid Prescribing Guidelines for Treatment of Acute Pain. The purpose of these guidelines are to urge prescribers to consider nonopioid therapies.  Secondly, Pharmacists are a crucial component to addressing opioid abuse by promoting responsible prescribing and adopting prevention practices.  We need to allow them to engage in potentially difficult conversations with patients. Finally, increase naloxone distribution to first responders, with a  focus on reducing  the stigma associated with the use of naloxone .","The government should not intervene by attempting to control income inequality. In a free society, income inequality is a necessary component of a productive capitalist economy.  Many of the social ills that are linked to income inequality are repercussions of poverty itself and not directly related to income inequality. The Government should  focus its resources on helping the truly poor ( improving public education, providing remedial training and schooling for adults, opening  up opportunities for economic advancement  giving  them the ability to support themselves.). I believe that the real issue is not income inequality, but the level of economic mobility. The results of bad federal and state policies has resulted in  an anemic economy with wage stagnation and the restriction of upward mobility.","The purpose of the  Public Information Act is to increase the public's faith in government, ensure accountability to the public, and  strengthen the public's ability to participate effectively.  There are explicit requirements for when meetings may be closed to the public, however there have been numerous violations with little consequences for the violators. Public shaming seems to be only punishment that is viable for the public.   The Maryland Open Meetings Act itself has only the mildest of consequences for offending agencies.  The legislature needs to tighten up the existing law by having tougher consequences for violators.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education? Are you committed to funding associated reforms, and if so, how?","Is Maryland’s transportation spending appropriately balanced between roads and transit?

The Fair Box deficit is not often discussed but most if not all public transportation operates at a loss which means that many of us not only pay for our own car but we also pay for others to ride in partially empty busses subsidized by tax dollars. I understand the need some have for public transportation, the question remains, how much of that problem deserves the hard earned tax dollars of others.","I do not think someone using marijuana presents the same societal threat a heroin or meth user poses. As for the full legalization of recreational marijuana, I am not prepared at this time to support it. As a lawmaker I have an obligation to hear and weigh evidence as well as an obligation to uphold our constitution in all my decisions.",Maryland has made great efforts to protect our bay. Other factors must be considered such as the waste and pollution from neighboring states. We must also look for ways to improve existing solutions to make them more effective. I also believe the watermen who live off of the bay's bounty of seafood should have a prominent seat at the table of decision making. They are closest to the bay and they are truly stakeholders.,The government has a track record inefficiency and waste. The less governmental interference the better.,"Baltimore's issue is poor leadership and our Attorney General Brian Frosh who fought hard to change Maryland's bail system and tilt the system in favor of the accused criminals by allowing them to be released without bail if they cannot afford to pay it will be a major failure moving forward. This was argued in the MD Court of Appeals in 2017, I testified against the legislation in a failed attempt to protect Marylanders.","Maryland is open for business. Unfortunately, our taxes are not competitive with many other states which puts us at a disadvantage when states with lower taxes.","One thing is for sure, Martin O'Malley should be banned from the process! It takes just a quick look at the congressional map of Maryland to see the fix is in for most Maryland Congressional districts. The  guidelines were not followed at the time the districts were redrawn and highly partisan decisions were made. The people of Maryland deserve better. If the lawmakers of Maryland do not have the integrity and character to follow existing guidelines already in place to protect the public, then yes, sadly we must depend on outsiders to be the voice of reason. It is sad that so many legislators take their oath of office so casually.","In my discussion with law enforcement, I conclude the current legislation is adequate however it is not without room for improvement. I support law enforcement and believe the men and women who put their lives on the line for us deserve our best effort to provide justice.  I respect and appreciate our law enforcement officers at all levels and will do all I can to keep them safe and properly protected by law.","I believe a multifaceted approach is needed. We must strengthen the family unit, this is where children learn their coping skills. Many addicts that I have dealt with in the past were victims of emotional pain resulting in anger,depression, anxiety and hopelessness. Many times this pain is treated by drug and alcohol abuse.  The family unit is the first line of defense.  In many neighborhoods the faith community has taken the initiative to start programs built around faith solutions for those wanting to deal with their addiction in that manner. I would also look into the  prescription drug industry as well as making sure current laws on the books are being properly enforced and judges are rendering proper sentencing for violators.  We must enforce harsh penalties for drug dealers as a deterrent for future dealers.","It is up to the free market to determine one's income in private business. If there is an inequality within the government then the government should attend to it.  I believe a person doing a job deserves to be properly compensated regardless of gender, race, etc.","In Maryland, the public does not have oversight of the government. In Maryland the government is run by the partisan entity known as the Democrat party. The meetings the public is privy to are in many cases after the fact and the fix is in. The public meeting is nothing more than entertainment. In a state where the majority party has a super majority, there is little hope for public oversight of the governmental workings. Currently the Public Information Act has little consequences for violators.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

I am committed to funding reforms that include increased funding from the City, the police department budget,  the Kirwan Commissions formula. Funding the findings include coordination and collaboration of current city and state resources that can be brought to our schools.","No, the spending is not appropriately balanced, and the region is not adequately served by transit, especially if one cannot get to a job that begins at 6am when transit begins running at 6am. There is a disproportionate amount of cars to transit on the roads that decrease the ability of buses to get around. The State has the resources to meet its transportation needs, but doesn't devote the resource to the Baltimore region.","Yes, I do support the legalization of recreational marijuana but with very defined rules on when and where it can be used due to the discrimination of use among whites and people of color, especially males.","Protecting the Chesapeake Bay begins at the local level: reducing trash and sewage in waterways and storm drains, updating age old infrastructures, banning plastics and plastic bags, strictly regulating the disposal of chemicals and toxins in water ways, and increasing recycling, up-cycling and composting opportunities and incentives for the State.","To ensure the broadest possible access to affordable health care, Maryland needs a holistic and universal approach which can start with further study of  SB878 and HB1312 (Health insurance - Medicaid Buy-In Task Force), for instance. The state needs universal health care that spends differently, which means moving towards direct medical care and finding the best preventative strategies to increase healthy outcomes.","The state should be at the forefront to help Baltimore address violent crime. This happens through community police training, policy, stabilization resources for families, trauma-informed care resources and incentives, and more collaboration between the city, police department, state's attorney office and the courts.",In the state it is critical that the fight for $15 also include a fight for job training and adult education for low-skilled workers who need the wage the most but who lack the skills necessary to compete for it. The state can provide incentives for on-the-job-training and childcare funding and resources  to foster creation of more family-supporting jobs.,"Yes, I support the creation of a non-partisan, independent body to draw legislative and Congressional district maps.  The process would enhance public trust and confidence in government and provide integrity and ethics in the process by removing self-preserving power or party favor.","No, the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights does not adequately balance protections for police and the public. Officers are expected to uphold the law, not be above it. Therefore officers should be held accountable in the same way anyone else would be for workplace misconduct and wrong-doing, or for suspected illegal activity.","Adopted strategies to address the opioid addiction and overdose crisis are to ensure current providers have the safest, most affordable and holistic treatment and resources, operate at the at the nations highest standard and efficiencies for treatment and care; improve legislation around high prescription cost and over prescribing; request a state-created public campaign about the opioid crisis: education to humanize those who suffer.","The state should address income inequality by working against and funding the root causes of income inequality: lack of a quality education and technology, encourage a free market, enhance computer and technology use among resources and programs, provide resources/funding for childcare, work on development for mix income housing, and continue the fight for universal health care.","Yes, I do believe that the meeting laws adequately ensure Marylander's ability to exercise oversight of the government  but the state needs a plan to fast track requested information to ensure public trust and transparency while working to define  ""protecting legitimate governmental interests and the privacy rights of individual citizens"".","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

Governor Hogan would like to roll back the gas tax, but then charge tolls to use the road. I would keep the current tax before I would consider tolls. The Baltimore region like many areas of Maryland is not adequately served by transit.","Other states that have legalized marijuana have benefitted from the influx of tax revenues and tourism. Legalization allows us to control how marijuana is produced and distributed – and to tax it as we do alcohol and tobacco.   We should also restrict its use in public, and impose penalties for sales to minors.  Let's address the concerns of parents, educators, and public safety experts, and learn from the experience of other states.","Saving the Bay is vital to Maryland's ecology and economy, and involves cooperation from the upstream community in MD, VA, WV, PA and DC. We especially need to do more to control agricultural and municipal runoff.","We need to look at expanding Medicaid for all to ensure that more people who need care can get it.  We'll save money in the long run from having to pay for emergency services that would be eliminated with preventative care. Having a populace of insured residents will attract medical professionals – my district currently was given a grade of ""D"" for access to health care due to a shortage of medical professionals and because many health care organizations limit the type of insurance they will accept.",Baltimore is an important part of Maryland. I will ask Baltimore area elected officials to inform me about how and if the state can help address violent crime.,"Our business climate can be improved. We have so much to bring businesses here – great schools, natural beauty, an innovative and educated populace – but we do need to provide more transit.

I have a record of leadership: Led the Mayor's Office of Neighborhoods and Constituent Services Led the State of Maryland's Community Outreach (Governor's Office of Community Initiatives) Chief of Staff of the Maryland Transit Administration Director of Community Outreach, East Baltimore - Johns Hopkins Director of Human Services for non-profit to revitalize Park Heights","The Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education has multiple promising preliminary findings in its draft, but I look forward to seeing the final recommendations and will fight to ensure they include priorities such as universal access to Prekindergarten, adequate funding for Baltimore City Public Schools, teacher incentives for those who are highly effective in the classroom, and a governance structure to guide the implementation of the recommendations of the Commission.  There must be a stronger system of governance to ensure that the recommendations are not merely implemented but are also effective.  We must identify multiple ways to fund the reforms, including private/public partnerships.  We have community assets that can participate in the reform process.  For example, hospitals can partner with schools to create opportunities in healthcare and fund those opportunities in collaboration with schools in the community/district.","There is a clearly a disproportionate gap between what's spent on roads and public transportation.  The state has not taken a comprehensive look at the transit system and recommendations since 2002! I'm excited that HB372 passed in the general assembly and requires the Maryland Transit Administration to prepare a Central Maryland Regional Transit Plan to identify the resources needed to meet its transportation needs.  The Baltimore region is not adequately served by transit.  For example, the recent shutdown of the subway system, showed exactly how reliant people are on our various modes of transportation.  I want to ensure that we have a truly connected system of transit to get people where they need to go, especially to job centers.  Studies show that there is a high correlation between those living in poverty and employment opportunities located 45 minutes or more away.  I will work to ensure that the transit plan crafted by the MTA specifically addresses the issue of access to job centers, particularly for those living in poverty.","The legalization of marijuana is a step towards reforming the criminal justice system.  Too many of our young people have been caught up in the criminal justice system as a direct result of marijuana laws. I believe marijuana should be regulated like alcohol and tobacco.   Legalization will create jobs and economic opportunity taking it out of the realm of an illegal drug market.  I would, however, like to see more minority participation in the creation of dispensaries or growers.  Minorities have been disproportionately harmed in the criminal justice system by the use and distribution of marijuana, therefore, there should be an emphasis on ensuring there is fair and inclusive representation in the legal marijuana industry.  In addition, we should evaluate dropping the charges of those arrested for simple pot possession similar to what was implemented in Philadelphia recently.","The Department of the Environment has a five-point plan to clean up the bay that has been effective.  However, there is always room for improvement.  The bay is an asset to our state that stimulates the economy while attracting revenue through tourism. We need to clean up the Bay faster and better and work with our neighboring states to decrease the waste trapped in our waterways, especially behind the Conowingo Dam. Additionally, the Obama-era Chesapeake Bay clean-up plan needs an update, particularly in terms of advocating for responsible regulation of farm runoff and industrial impact. Our State and Federal government have the capabilities to work together to protect streams and watersheds which make up the Bay by providing pathways for true regulation of those responsible for runoff. It is our responsibility to create enforceable guidelines to keep the Watershed healthy.","All Marylanders deserve the right to affordable health care.  One way to ensure broad access to affordable health care is to uncover ways to increase health insurance carriers' participation in Maryland's Health Exchange which stabilizes health insurance cost.  Additionally, employers can help improve the healthcare market by negotiating better insurance for their employees and provide preventive care services within the workplace. We also must find ways to protect seniors from the constantly increasing health care costs, especially as it relates to prescription drugs.  Our children also deserve to have health services and information in schools which the community school model promotes through its comprehensive process of identifying community needs.","The state certainly plays a critical role in helping to address violent crime, from both a policy and enforcement perspective. The state must ensure that the recommendations of the federally mandated consent decree are followed and that there is public input and collaboration as it is implemented.  I believe that local control of the police department should be given to Baltimore City to allow for more reflective input in policies by the public and City Council.  I will continue to fight for more resources to go to proven grassroots public safety organizations that provide critical assistance to communities by helping curb violence and offer resources for those who are or have been involved in criminal activities.  Organizations such as Safe Streets, Cease Fire and Turn Around Tuesday need the financial support, as well as a coordinated effort, to target the communities most in need of the critical services they provide to address violence in our neighborhoods.","I believe that while we are moving in the right direction, there is always room for improvement for Maryland's business climate.   We will find ways to incentivize businesses by providing tax relief measures which are essential to spur business growth here in the state. We can facilitate creating more family-supporting jobs by giving people a living wage and supporting workforce training and apprenticeship programs that can be a pathway to the middle class.  Additionally, transportation must be aligned to job centers so it's not a complicated endeavor for our residents to quickly access a variety of public transportation options to destinations throughout the state.","I support reform for how we draw our voting boundaries in the state.  Having a transparent, independent commission to draw district lines is a popular choice for most Marylanders as demonstrated in a Spring 2017 Goucher poll.  I think further research into others states with independent commissions (such as California) is required and should evaluate the processes and outcomes of their endeavors for relevance in Maryland.  We must ensure there are equal standards of representation in the process and ensure that there is public input with any process.","There is room for improvement in balancing protections for police and the public in the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights that can also help improve police/community relations.  While I understand the need for due process, we must do more to ensure the public can address any police misconduct when it is presented.  We must make it easier to identify police misconduct by shortening wait times before officers are interviewed following a reported incident.   The current practice grants the officers more time to obtain representation which is not what is afforded the general public.","The opioid crisis should be treated as a public health crisis and not a matter for law enforcement to handle alone. Simply stated, it requires a multi-pronged approach which incorporates the efforts of many initiatives and agencies.  There are a few key strategies we need to look at to target addiction and overdose:  •	Better monitoring of prescription drugs and their over use •	Expansion of programs for drug treatment versus the criminalization of users •	Ensuring that those who are incarcerated are provided the services needed for addiction, both during and after their time has been served •	Making the overdose drug (Narcan) more readily available ",There is no one initiative that will address the disparity.  This is some longstanding issues that we must find multiple ways to address.  Efforts include:  •	Increase the minimum wage to give individuals a living wage of $15 per hour •	Put people to work to rebuild the state's infrastructure •	Ensure the new housing development includes affordable units for low and moderate-income residents •	Fund and promote more financial literacy programming •	Invest in public education with an eye toward public/private partnership •	Ensure that our public transportation takes individuals to job centers ,"As outlined in the Final Report of the Office of Attorney General's report on the implementation of the Public Information Act (PIA), there is still work to be done to ensure adequate oversight of government. There is a volunteer Public Information Act Compliance Board that has already seen a number of requests which has stretched them to their limit.  I believe we should investigate combining the PIA and Open Meetings Compliance Board to ensure that the two are not overburdened.  They also should be a paid board, not strictly volunteers.  As a former manager within a state agency, I understand the requirements of a PIA and it can be very taxing when you have multiple divisions within large state agencies.  I would recommend that, moving forward, state agencies have a staff member designated to respond to such requests thus streamlining the process and ensuring rapid response.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

I am also the Business Development Manager for The St. Paul Group.  I grew up in a family restaurant and have worked as General Manager of two restaurants.  I also worked for Comcast for five years when I was in my twenties.,"Absolutely.  I supported HB 1783 in 2018.  When I arrived to the legisalture, we had an unfunded mandate called the Thornton Commission.  I supported that and we have been able to fund that forumula ever since.  I would insist we do the same for the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education.  In 2018, I also helped streamline the school construction and renovation process by passing HB 221.","I do not feel there is a correct balance.  I disagree with the Administrations push to simply widen highways (like 295).  Widening roads does not reduce traffic.   We still have many unsafe situations in my district where employees are often crossing one or two major highways on foot.  Furthermore, the intersection of I-95 and I-695 needs to be completed as it was proposed.  Portions of that project that were abandoned have led to very unsafe exits during peak hours.  Vehicles stopped in the right hand lane on a major highway like I-695 is extremely dangerous and must be addressed as it was originally proposed.","I think we need to see how our medical marijuana program performs before thinking of expanding to recreational use.  I would like to see medical marijuana used as an alternative pain remedy to opioids.  I also think voters should have a say in the legalization of recreational marijuana through referendum.  I did support decriminalizing moderate amounts of marijuana.  I also feel that it is far less dangerous that alcohol.  No one has ever died of an overdose on marijuana, and the federal government needs to recognize that there are far more potential benefits to the plant than there are negatives.","I have received the endorsement of the Maryoand League of Conservation Voters.  I have supported the expansion of the use of clean, renewable energy.  We are at a critical time in our State and our Country, when we have a head of the EPA who doesn't believe that we need an EPA (according to his past statements).  The Bay is our most precious resource and we should do everything in our power to protect it.","As Vice Chairman of the Health and Government Operations Committee, I could write several pages on the legislation that we have passed over the last 16 years.  I have sponsored legislation to allow Maryland to sue for price gouging of pharmaceuticals (Maryland is the first state in the country to do so).  In 2018, we worked with Governor Hogan to pass legsialtion with the hopes of driving down premiums.  But, much of the situation in which we find ourselves is a direct result of President Trump deciding to relax the individual mandate.  In doing so, more young people are opting not to get insurance, leaving the insurance pool full of less healthy indivuduals.  I equate this to only making people who get into accidents pay for car insurance.  If we did not all pay car insurance, premiums would be unaffordable.","We should provide Baltimore City with every resource they need.  As a representative of Baltimore County whose district ends at the city line, I do not consider this to be a problem that ends at the city line, especially as crime has increased in the neighborhoods I represent that border the City.","I think we have a por busines climate.  I feel the legislature needs more people with a business background.  The problem may be that if you are a business owner or general manager of a business, it is often difficult to be away from your business for 90 days.  I testified to this fact before the commission that determines the pay for our legislature.  I did NOT ask for a raise for legislators,  just that the committee consider options for making the legislature more attractive to small business owners.",Yes.,"I would need to take a closer look.  Legislation dealing with this issue has been introduced in 2018, but has not advanced.  The police that represent my constituents do an incredible job, but I realize that every jurisdiction is different.","As Chairman of the Opioid Workgroup in the House of Delegates, we have attacked this crisis in many ways.  We first began by making this a non-partisan issue.  We insisted that the workgroups in the House and Senate work with the Hogan Administration to maximize our efforts.  We have passed the HOPE Act to expand access to treatment.  We passed the Start Talking Now Act which helps educate our children about the dangers of opioids.  We have implemented a Prescrition Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) to help identify doctor shoppers as well as overprescribers.  We have expanded the use of naloxone (narcan), a life-saving overdose reversal drug.  In 2018, we will see 211 act as our crisis hotline as well as a number to call to report ""pill mills.""  In addition, we have passed legislation to help each individual jurisdiction address their respective behavioral health and opioid crisis needs, having realized that different jurisdictions may have different needs.","Until everyone earnes the same wages for an honest days work, we must do EVERYTHING possible to achieve true income equality.

Accounting),"Accountant (Joseph E. Seagram and Sons Inc, B&R Brooks Professionals Tax Service)","Yes, I voted in favor of HB1415, which establishes several recommendations put forth by Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education. I believe the funding formula for public schools needs to be adjusted to account for the additional needs of high-risk areas and poverty concentrated communities.","It is undeniable that there is need for investment in transportation, both in roads and transit. However, for the Baltimore area, I believe investment in transit needs to be a priority. Adequate public transportation is the best economic equalizer. I was proud to support Maryland Metro/Transit Funding Act, for this reason. In addition to providing additional funds to MTA, it requires assessment and prioritization of maintenance needs.","At this point, I would like to focus on the rollout of medical cannabis before addressing the legalization of recreational marijuana. We need ensure the medical cannabis industry is more diverse, patient-focused, and accessible before creating a recreational market.","Maryland should be focusing on ways the entire state can address the health of the Chesapeake Bay. This includes efforts to strengthen our forests, which are crucial to healthy watersheds. That is why I supported legislation to strengthen the Forest Conservation Act.","With the uncertainty of healthcare coverage due to national politics, Maryland must take steps to stabilize healthcare markets, bring costs down, and increase accessibility of healthcare. For this reason, I have supported efforts such as the Maryland Health Care Access Act of 2018, which will provide the funding for the establishment of a reinsurance program. I believe we should also establish a Drug Cost Commission to create more accountability and transparency in pricing of prescription drugs.","To address violent crime in Baltimore, the state should commit to funding programs such as the Safe Streets Initiative. These community programs focus on violence prevention and intervention through community-based organizations. By supporting these efforts, we can build up the communities in Baltimore and prevent further violent crime.","Maryland has been given the reputation being unfriendly to businesses. I believe that regulation, entrepreneurship, and economic prosperity can coincide when effectively implemented. I have served on the Advisory Board on the Impact of Regulation on Small Businesses and worked to propose legislative fixes to common issues businesses have with regulation, including convoluted compliance guides.  In order to ensure businesses in Maryland create jobs that allow employees to support families, I believe the state has a role in mandating policies such as paid family and safe leave, as we did in 2017.",Yes.,"As currently structured, the ""Law Enforcement Officer's Bill of Rights"" (LEOBR) imposes significant impediments to the discipline and/or removal of bad officers. Under LEOBR, officers are judged only by other officers. LEOBR prevents the formation of civilian review boards that would foster accountability and trust. A review board composed of officers, civilians and an administrative judge would, in my opinion, lend itself to the highest level of transparency.","There is no simple solution to the opioid crisis. However, we should be doing everything we can as a state to encourage government agencies and community stakeholders to work as partners and support cross-program work in our budget, such as the Behavioral Health Crisis Response Grant Program. These grants can be used to provide funds to local jurisdictions to establish and expand community behavioral health crisis response systems. Additionally, the State should work with law enforcement and medical and mental health professionals to identify and implement preventative strategies.","Income inequality needs to be addressed from several angles, including access to education, investment in public transit, and employee protections. I believe higher education should be affordable and will continue to support initiatives like the Community College Promise Scholarship. Investing in reliable public transit ensures that economic mobility is not dependent on car-ownership. Finally, inequalities must be addressed with protective policies such as the Equal Work Equal Pay Act, which prohibits wage discrimination based on sex or gender. Further protections are needed and should be considered.","Enacted in 1970, the Maryland's Public Information Act (PIA) grants broad access to public records while protecting legitimate governmental interests and individual privacy rights. This along with Maryland's Open Meeting Act, which requires adequate notice to these meetings and the allowance for public inspection of the meetings minutes, speaks volumes when it come to fostering access, transparency and oversight.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

After graduating from Princeton, I worked in medical labs all over the country and played music in an indie band for several years. It was in Florida that I met my wife Mary. After we settled down in Portland, I decided to fulfill my lifelong dream of going to medical school. In medical school, I really cut my teeth as an activist, protesting the greed of the health insurance companies while the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) was being drafted. I moved to Baltimore to fulfill my residency training in Family & Preventive Medicine in a joint program with MedStar Franklin Square Medical Center and the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health. During my residency I joined several labor union campaigns, testified on legislation in front of the General Assembly and the City Council, and even got arrested in Washington protesting attempts to repeal Obamacare. I work at the Baltimore Medical System's clinic in Bel-Air Edison, a federally qualified health clinic providing care to the uninsured. I am also the Chair of Medchi's Public Health Committee, and I sit on the board of Physicians for a National Health Program.","With the Kirwan reforms, we will fulfill the promise of Thornton and honor the state's constitutional requirement to adequately educate all our children. The reforms which are most exciting to me include implementing a Finnish-style ""master teacher"" program, reforming the funding formula to acknowledge concentrated poverty, expanding community schools, and universal pre-K. Politicians who won't acknowledge the obvious are cowards: if we want to fix our public schools, we will need to raise taxes. Maryland has the most millionaires per capita of any state. We should be taxing millionaires again. Governor O'Malley's temporary tax on income over $1 million, which was in place from 2007 to 2010, netted about $120 million, despite being a measly 0.75% higher than the state's tax on income over $500,000 (at 6.25% vs. 5.5%). We should explore a steeper progressive income tax with more brackets (at $10 million, $100 million, etc.). The narrative that the millionaire tax drove out taxpayers is simply a false one: some millionaires left the state during the recession but were already returning by 2010 (when the tax was still in place, but the economy was rebounding). I will also fight for universal free tuition for all programs at state colleges and universities, all the way up to MDs and PhDs. As Vice President Joe Biden liked to say, ""Don't tell me what you value. Show me your budget, and I'll tell you what you value."" We're a wealthy state. We can afford a fair, world-class education system.","Ask people at any bus stop in Baltimore City, especially outside of ""the white L,"" whether they are pleased with BaltimoreLink. They will tell you, resoundingly, ""No."" If it takes a person longer to get to work, church, and school, that is time that person cannot spend doing other things—and time, for an hourly worker, is money. The cancellation of the Red Line and the curtailment of many bus routes which has been disguised by the euphemism of ""reform""—accompanied by the Governor's push for expanding the highways—is nothing short of a tax on working Baltimoreans to provide a subsidy for suburbanites. We need to make expanding public transportation a high priority for several reasons: carbon pollution (transportation is the leading cause of US greenhouse gas emissions), particulate pollution (Baltimore has the deadliest air in America according to a 2013 study from MIT), quality of life (Maryland has some of the longest commutes in the country, averaging over 30 minutes), keeping young people in the city (a 2017 Politico survey of American mayors found that inadequate public transportation was the #2 barrier to retaining millennials), and economic equity (working-class and unemployed people are far more likely to use public transportation). Let's go beyond the Red Line: let's build the six lines of the Baltimore Regional Rail System Plan. Let's follow Montgomery County's example and fund bus rapid transit across the state. Let's pass a state-wide complete streets initiative to make our communities safer, healthier, greener, easier, and better places to live.","As a doctor who recommends medical cannabis to my patients, I am glad to see our state's long-delayed program finally implemented. I am encouraged by studies showing that medical cannabis laws reduce opioid overdoses. I support placing recreational legalization on the ballot to let Maryland decide—but given my public health background, I am not comfortable mandating legalization without the people's informed consent. I am similarly reticent about legalizing sports betting or relaxing regulations on craft brewing. The state should not make it easier for companies to profit off of addiction. We do not yet definitively know how recreational cannabis legalization impacts rates of teen usage, let alone how cannabis influences the developing brain. We do not yet know how legalization affects traffic fatalities. We do not know which states' models of legalization are most effective, both from the public health standpoint, and in terms of ensuring small businesspeople rather than Big Tobacco and Big Liquor companies reap the benefits. I will fight for racial equity in the permitting process for dispensaries. I support raising the threshold for decriminalization (Maryland, for example, decriminalizes possession of up to 10 grams, a lower limit even than Mississippi, at 30 grams). I will fight for nonviolent marijuana offenders to be released from state prisons. To me, it is a higher priority that we reduce policing of nonviolent crimes like sex work and drug trafficking, and work toward providing economic opportunities for marginalized communities, than that we create legal markets for possibly harmful illicit activities.","We need to restore funding to the Maryland Department of the Environment so that it can do its job properly, especially now that we know the EPA is in the polluters' pockets. We need to provide more funding to Baltimore and other local governments for stormwater management (including fixing Baltimore's sewers). I support the Poultry Litter Management Act, which would force corporations, rather than the public, to pay the costs of cleaning up excess manure. I also support strengthening the Forest Conservation Act, because forests are a key safeguard to toxic runoff entering the Bay. It is not a commonly understood fact that air pollution actually contaminates our waterways as well, especially pollution from coal plants. The renewable energy transformation we need—I support the 100% Clean Renewable Energy and Equity Act—would not only reduce contaminants in the Bay, but also improve air quality and mitigate climate change. Climate change itself will also have a negative impact on the bay, as ocean acidification reduces crab and oyster yields (higher-acidity water makes it harder for these animals to create their shells)—and as increasing salinity from sea level rise makes it impossible for many kinds of animals to live in the Bay at all. Moving at breakneck speed to 100% renewable energy, increasing housing density and public transportation, taking combustion engines off the road, improving farming practices, increasing energy efficiency across sectors, establishing a carbon tax, etc.—climate change is a massively complicated and important issue, and will require a broad set of reforms.","I lost a close friend to a brain tumor that probably would not have killed him or bankrupted his family if he had simply had health insurance. My life experience, my values, and the uninsured people I have gotten to know in clinic have made me a strong believer in a single-payer healthcare system. I am a strong supporter of the Healthy Maryland Act. Maryland, with its all-payer system for hospitals, is best poised to be the first state to implement single-payer. We could lead the nation, like Massachusetts's reforms laid the groundwork for the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). Last October, I was invited to join Senator Bernie Sanders on his tour of the Canadian healthcare system. People in Canada do not go bankrupt because of medical expenses, but they lack adequate prescription drug coverage. Maryland is the first state to pass an anti–price-gouging bill for generic drugs. We need to expand our efforts against price-gouging to cover name-brand drugs and mandate cost transparency. The care I provide does little good if my patients cannot afford to fill the prescriptions I write for them. Likewise, my clinical effectiveness is impeded when my patients cannot access healthy food. Maryland's Fresh Food Financing Initiative is a good program but doesn't begin to approach the requisite scale. Nutrition, like healthcare, should be recognized as a human right, and if we approached the issue from that perspective, I have no doubt we would be putting more resources into making healthy food accessible and affordable.","Violent crime is an issue with long-run causes, but short-run, tragic consequences. In the long-run, we must commit to ending racialized poverty in Baltimore. However, poverty is not the only cause of violent crime. Baltimore had more murders than New York last year. New York's population is 14-times larger than Baltimore; Baltimore does not, however, have a 14-times greater poverty rate than New York. It is not only Baltimore's poverty, but our long-running addiction problems, our mistrusted and corrupt police department, our massive abandoned housing stock, our failing schools, etc., that contribute to the violence. Most of these problems cannot be solved overnight. However, we are not powerless here. The state should stop doubling down on policies we know do not work, like mandatory minimums. I promise, I will vote against any bill which enhances mandatory minimums. We should fund the policies that we know actually work, like violence interruption. We need to provide counselors in high-violence neighborhood schools to help children cope with trauma. We need to get lead paint and pipes out of our communities, because lead poisoning is a known contributor to brain damage and violent behavior. Ultimately, one of the main contributing factors to our violent crime crisis in Baltimore is that the relationship of trust between the Baltimore Police Department and the community has completely broken down. A major step for real change would be restoring Baltimore's control of the BPD so that Baltimoreans can establish civilian oversight and community policing according to our needs.","Maryland is a wealthy state, which is also home to a lot of poor people. I believe in bottom-up and not top-down economic development. We should be investing in our communities (excellent schools, affordable housing, quality transit, universal healthcare)—not in luxury developments and giveaways to corporate behemoths. I would have voted against the incentive package for Amazon's second headquarters, and if Amazon does accept Maryland's bid, as a legislator, I will fight to ensure that $8+ billion giveaway never comes to pass. We should be leveling the playing field for workers by enhancing their ability to bargain collective and raising the minimum wage. When workers have more income, they spend that income in their communities, lifting up local businesses. We should be taking burdens off the shoulders of our small businesspeople by providing healthcare as a human right. When entrepreneurs don't have to worry about healthcare inflation, they can focus on growing their businesses. I realize that there are some who believe that cutting taxes and cutting regulations will help businesses create more jobs, and thereby to reduce poverty—but growth which comes at the expense of workers' protections, our infrastructure, and our environment is not sustainable. Maryland does have way too much red tape, however, and we need to make it easier for people to start a business. I will fight corporate influence on our regulations which tilts the playing field against competition. I will shine a light on state contracts and ensure small business get a fair shake.","Voters should pick their politicians, not politicians their voters. I support removing redistricting from political influence. I also support public financing of elections (Montgomery County's law provides a model for the state), making it easier for third parties to attain ballot access, opening Maryland's primaries to independents, implementing special elections for legislative vacancies, and expanding early voting. Voter participation in the last state election was 44.5%; that's abysmal, and it reflects a lack of faith in the ability of our political system to translate the democratic will of the people. Gerrymandering is a major problem, but not the only problem, which our democracy faces. In addition to these common sense reforms, it is time to start discussing more radical ones, such as top-two primaries (like in California), ranked choice voting (like in Minneapolis), the all-mail ballot (like in Oregon), and participatory budgeting (like in Jackson). If ever there were a time to worry for the health of our democracy, it is during the Trump presidency. We can and must deepen our democracy, and in fact, it is probably only in deepening democracy that we can save it.","I honor our police officers. They put their lives on the line every day. Police deserve to be our heroes. I know, from talking to thousands of people across our city, that Baltimoreans do not hate the police. They want the police to be able to do their jobs, and they know policing can be done without violating people's rights. Even worse than police misconduct is the effect that misconduct has on community-police relations. Officers do not work well in communities where they feel they are hated—and civilians do not cooperate with police that they fear are outside the law. We need a functioning police department, and police misconduct with impunity makes that impossible. Maryland should repeal the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights. Even in states without laws like the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights (which has been passed in 14 states), it is often too difficult to punish police misconduct. The complicated relationship between prosecutors and police, as is well known, makes it difficult for prosecutors to go after police misconduct, for fear of reduced police cooperation in future cases. I would therefore strongly support a law mandating special prosecutors, at the very least in cases of fatal officer-involved shootings. The days of impunity for bad apples must come to an end. Special prosecutors in cases of police misconduct could go a long way towards restoring the trust of the people of Baltimore in their police department. Restoring that relationship should be our number one objective.","In January, I wrote an editorial for the Sun, entitled ""Opioid Makers Should Pay for Anti-Addiction Efforts,"" which spells out some of the ways I would address the opioid crisis. Firstly, as with the tobacco companies, we should hold the pharmaceutical companies accountable for their deceptive advertising of opioid painkillers—and sue to ensure that they pay as much of the costs as possible for solving the crisis. The opioid epidemic is officially the worst drug epidemic in our country's history, killing more people in 2017 than traffic collisions and firearms combined. We can stem the tide upstream, by reducing the number and duration of prescriptions and ensuring patients have access to non-addictive pain treatments like physical therapy; midstream, by increasing funding for rehabilitative services, diverting addicts away from incarceration and into treatment, and taking bold new steps like establishing supervised injection facilities; and downstream, by ensuring that naloxone is widely available at an affordable price. In most of the country, including in Maryland, the opioid epidemic shows no signs of abating, which is why we should be keen to learn from places that are having an impact. Vermont's ""hub-and-spoke"" system, for example, has fostered coordination among providers and drastically reduced wait times for addicts seeking treatment. There is not a single supervised injection facility in the United States, despite the decades of evidence that these programs save lives, reduce infections, and get people into treatment. We can only solve the opioid crisis by combining compassion with evidence-based policy.","Rising income inequality has two components: increasing costs of life's necessities and wage growth stagnation. Policies I've mentioned above, like single-payer healthcare, lowering prescription drug prices, expanding public transportation, making public universities free, and improving our public schools would all work to keep money in working families' pockets. Affordable housing is another requirement for income equality. I support an ""all of the above"" housing strategy, including: supporting, expanding, and protecting existing public housing; providing funding to start up community land trusts across the state (and making it easier to wrest ownership of vacant properties from delinquent title-holders); requiring new developments to contain a higher proportion of affordable units; establishing limited rent control and enhancing tenants' rights against eviction, including legal aid for rent court cases; and enhanced anti-discrimination enforcement in housing. On wages, I support raising the minimum wage to a cost-of-living–adjusted $15/hour. Since discrimination remains a major contributor to inequality, companies should have to be transparent about how they pay their employees, broken down by gender and ethnicity. The state should also work to protect workers' rights to form unions, including in the ""gig economy"" (e.g., dependent contractors like Uber drivers) and the service sector, but especially in the public sector (where graduate students, community college employees, and student athletes are not awarded the same labor protections as other government workers) and in firms receiving state contracts (through project labor agreements, labor peace agreements, and prevailing wage agreements). Unionized workers are paid more without any need for government regulation.","In 2015, the Center for Public Integrity gave Maryland a ""D"" for State Integrity. This rating was given before the implementation of the 2014 reform to the Public Information Act, but many of the same issues remain. We need to further lower the fees for information requests, beef up enforcement for agencies who violate transparency laws, and reduce the number of exemptions to the Public Information Act. As for the Open Meetings Act, which was reformed in 2013—again, the enforcement is just not where it needs to be, and often lacks sufficient teeth. The State Open Meetings Law Compliance Board has no authority to enforce its rulings, unlike the State Ethics Commission, and even when a fine is levied by the circuit court for an Open Meetings Act violation, the fines are typically measly. The Public Integrity Act, passed in 2017, should also be strengthened to further limit the ""revolving door"" problem, where former government employees go to work for lobbying firms and use their old political connections to further corporate interests. The Public Integrity Act imposes a moratorium on lobbying for former executive and legislative branch employees, for one year after they leave state employment. One year is not enough ""cool out"" time when you're talking about potential corruption. The saga of Senator Nathaniel Oaks, who recently resigned, has dominated this cycle's elections in District 41. People are crying out for transparency and accountability. We have made a lot of progress, but we have a long way to go.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

Yes. The casino funds must be money that supplements and not supplants education budgets.  I hope the 2018 Constitutional Amendment passes.  And then after it does pass, we need to make sure the budget policy is implemented in a transparent and well crafted manner so that the Kirwin Commission recommendations are met and $2.9 billion is added to the budget on an ongoing and stable schedule.","The formula for Roads v. Transit should have some flexibility, but I think that far more should be spend on transit.  Furthermore, we have to make tough decisions and tough votes to support transit oriented development if we are going to really believe that transit deserves the lion's share of the funding.  This is not only a traffic issue, it is a safety issue, an economic justice issue, an environmental issue and a civil rights issue.  We could better utilize our transportation trust fund, and we can find ways to increase the revenues through linking the tax and fees to inflation.  There are huge savings we can realize through audit of the procurement process.  Furthermore, One way to ensure funding is to better police transit and to increase the fair box recovery.  Once more Baltimoreans are earning better wages, there will be an incentive to charge the proper amount for transit services.","I believe that before legalization significant study is required to fully understand the long term ramifications of recreational marijuana use both in brain development and road safety.  This policy decision needs to be driven by statistically based data. Since the Nixon administration's launching of the War on Drugs, governments have been prosecuting marijuana users and jailing millions of people. In fact, in 2010 52% of all drug arrests were marijuana related. Not only is this practice blatantly discriminatory towards minorities, but we know now that marijuana is not the dangerous drug that politicians have sought to make us believe it is. While marijuana is not completely harmless and can be misused (i.e., while driving), studies show that it is in fact not a ""gateway"" drug. In addition, marijuana could provide a boon to our economy and add another sector to provide jobs. If marijuana is legalized, lawmakers must make sure that it is properly regulated and we will work tirelessly to ensure it stays out of the hands of minors with the exception of medicinal purposes.","The University of Maryland School of Law environmental clinic ought to be given the unrestricted authority to assist in researching and litigating environmental matters around the state.  A dedicated environmental trust fund needs to be created with money from REGI funds and other funds generated by Maryland energy users to provide the funds necessary to adhere to environmental regulations.   We need a team of strong-willed legislators from Annapolis to spear head an lobbying effort on our federal legislative team to convince Congress and the Administration to reestablish funding for our national treasure.  We need to pass legislation that requires more and better recycling.  In addition, we must create more transit incentives and better bike and walk options.","The ACA was one of the most sweeping reform bills in the history of our nation. It was a step forward in advancing the U.S healthcare system to reach closer to the affordability and access of other first world countries. However, ObamaCare was not perfect, and as a delegate I will continue the fight that I supported for twelve years.  That is to say, we in Maryland have taken proper measures to ensure that the market remains stable and that people who cannot afford private healthcare are able to utilize Medicaid and Medicare programs and remain healthy.  The 2018 session was no exception, but our state must continue to be a leader in stabilizing the market. In Washington, the current administration is picking apart crucial policies such as the individual mandate that act to destabilize the market and hurts Americans. The individual mandate, though misunderstood, is critical because it diversifies the healthcare pool in a way that allows those with pre-existing conditions to receive affordable healthcare without raising premiums for everyone. At a time when the federal government is attacking Medicare and other healthcare programs, we need strong leadership in Annapolis to check these measures. I have a proven track record in this realm, and I am prepared to lead the fight in providing the broadest possible access to Marylanders.","A strong and safe Baltimore means a strong and safe region and a strong state.  The state needs to be a partner with the city, and as a proud product of Baltimore City,  if I am elected, I would like to help set up a task-force that brings city, county and state resources together (chaired by city officials) to both study and recommend legislation and regulations that will move the City in the right direction toward reduction and elimination of crime.    Furthermore, improvement of the education system and assistance with making both properties more valuable and neighborhoods more desirable will organically improve the City's prospects.  All of these policy areas should and can have positive state influence.","We need to constantly be re-evaluating how to create a positive business climate without doing irreparable hard to the environment or to income equality.  Incentives for large firms to come to Maryland is one aspect of trying to grow our business and job opportunities.  However, more important than that is to invest in stable communities of well-educated and desirable prospective employees so that business will locate here to find the people to man the jobs.   Our jurisdictions should not be obstacles or create unnecessary regulatory hurdles for business to locate in the state.  Simultaneously, we have to study the incentives and reasons that other states succeed in courts businesses and individuals and compete on those levels as well.","The State of Maryland has a long history of intense gerrymandering, leaving people misrepresented and giving unfair advantages to one party or the other. On the federal level, my 3rd Congressional District well-known as one of the most gerrymandered in the country. Last year George Mason University conducted a poll stating that 65% Marylanders want district lines redrawn. As former chair of the Election Law subcommittee for eight years and as the former chair of the National Conference of State Legislatures' Redistricting and Election Law Taskforce, I have advocated for and fought for a non-partisan process of redistricting.  In fact, my opinion is that political party control over what is supposed to be a non-partisan system is antithetical to my Masters training in public policy and administration.  I think that Maryland needs to be a leader in this issue and show that we support a fair and balanced system that represents the State's population to the highest degree of accuracy possible. Because if this, I would be in favor of an independent and well vetted non-partisan body making sure that Maryland districts are as representative as possible.","In recent years, the issue of police brutality and racial injustice has come to light in unfortunate situations. On one side, we must protect our police officers, who offer their lives for the sake of protecting our citizenry each and every day. On the other side, we must hold accountable those police who act unjustly or unlawfully, just like we do to anyone else who is delinquent in their job. The Maryland Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights is of the most extreme in the country. Officers need to be protected, but they are not free from the duties of their jobs. We need to come together in a transparent forum with citizens, politicians, and law enforcement and amend this policy so that officers can be held accountable for their actions and so that citizens feel confident that the system is not stacked against them.  Everyone deserves a fair shake. Additionally, we need to establish a better connection between communities and law enforcement so that they can work together to make our state safe. In the wake of tragedies like Freddie Gray, it's clear that we need a new and innovative approach to these injustices.","Some, like the President, will have you believe that mandatory minimums and harsher sentences (including the death penalty) will solve the opioid crisis.  They won't.  The federal government's War on Drugs has failed epically, and research consistently shows that aside from being punitive, these measures are simply ineffective. Instead, Maryland should focus funds and efforts on outreach and rehabilitation to drug users and user/dealers. In reference to best practices, take for example, Portugal, where a progressive approach to drug use has been adopted, those who are found using small scale drugs are brought to a panel made up of a psychologist, a social worker, and a legal advisor, who then devise an appropriate treatment plan. Not incidentally, teenage drug use dropped and people seeking treatment more than doubled. We need to study the best practices from around the world and confront these issues head on.  We also need to look at pill protection and disposal policies as a way to limit initial addictions.  Now, it's time for us Marylanders to be leaders and pioneers in using innovative and proven approaches to curb drug use commencement and addiction.","I think there are multiple efforts we can consider to combat income inequality.  First, we need to consider an increase in the minimum wage.  This should be done transparently, where we must take into account the hardships this could create for businesses.  In the end, I think that if we can have the dialogue, we can come up with a suitable compromise.  The current minimum wage of $9.25 is not a livable wage for many families and leaves large swaths of the population unable to provide for themselves and loved ones. Furthermore, expansion of WIC, food stamps and tax incentives could have a positive impact.  Finally, lobbying the federal delegation for additional assistance is imperative and I would be honored to do that for Maryland citizen.  Putting more money in the hands of the consumer means more spending at local businesses. Once we begin to consider income inequality as both an economical issue and a humanitarian one, the answers will surface to provide support for individuals stuck in the vicious cycle of poverty.   Other solutions include lowering minimum sentence on petty crimes indicative of poverty, making it easier to expunge minor criminal records after a 5 year clean record period, and providing services and voting rights to ex-felons who have paid their debt to society.  I worked on these issues for over a decade in Annapolis and I hope to have the opportunity to lead the way for more effective legislature in this area once again.","I am a big fan of the public information act and the fact that anyone has the opportunity to see legislation in action, but we can always be working hard to ensure transparency. The people we represent have a right to know and understand their delegates and the inner workings of government. As a former delegate, I was always approachable and invited everyone who wished to visit me for an honest and transparent discussion – even if we were on opposite sides of an issue.  If elected back to the House, I expect to be approachable so that the people of my district feel like they are being heard and understand exactly where I stand on the issues. The open nature of legislative sessions definitely plays into this, and I think it's a necessity for the people to be able access government documents.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

I am also a Captain in the Army Reserve, where I serve as the Brigade Intelligence Chief for the 354th Civil Affairs Brigade.  Additionally, I am a law student at the David A. Clarke School of Law at the University of the District of Columbia.","Yes. Among the reforms that the Commission outlines as necessary to maintain Maryland's competitiveness, there must be increased emphasis on pushing for universal education for four-year-olds. Impacting children at these early formative years is proven to have positive outcomes that lasts well into adulthood.  As far as funding is concerned, we need to ensure that money going into a so-called educational 'lockbox' as proposed by Governor Hogan does not mean that at the same time funding that would otherwise be appropriated to education in the general fund is removed.  Additionally, we will need to scrutinize Comptroller Franchot's claims that there is at present enough revenue streams to meet Maryland's investment in education.","I believe that it is misleading to argue whether transportation spending is balanced between roads and transit.  I am of the opinion that transportation spending, in its entirety, is insufficient in sustaining pre-existing infrastructure much less address expansion and growth.  Take for example MD-210.  Project planning for the development of overpass-type interchanges was completed in 2004.  It was not until 2016 before sufficient funding allowed the construction to be underway.  Even accounting for delays attributed to right-of-way and environmental impact, this timeframe is unacceptable to any Marylander that relies on it to get around.  Elsewhere, decisions on public transit such as the cancellation of Baltimore's proposed Red Line in favor of BaltimoreLink show some promise for Baltimoreans, although BaltimoreLink is still relatively new and inefficiencies persist in part due to under-utilization.",Yes.,"Remain committed to advocating the importance of restoring and maintaining the Chesapeake Bay to Federal legislators and federal agency-level partners at the Environmental Protection Agency.  Prioritize funding on restoral efforts to meet sudden budget shortfalls.  Seek new revenue to bolster funding, to include slight increases to the Bay Restoration Fund.","According to a 2016 report by the National Center for Health Statistics, roughly 5.6% of Marylanders lack health insurance.  It is pivotal to understand what the barriers are for these people and create solutions tailored to them. Opioid addiction, homelessness, chronic health issues need to be targeted in order to move the bar from 5.6% to 0%.","Coordinate with the mayor of Baltimore on near-term solutions, which may include law enforcement support.  More importantly, however, focus on long-term solutions, which includes engaging with community leaders in building civic-government coalitions, funding job training programs, and incentivizing businesses to build, develop, and hire locals within historically disadvantaged areas.","The Maryland Business Climate Survey for 2018 found that most businesses in Maryland expect growth.  At the same time, 55% of these businesses were having difficulty in finding skilled workers.  The state can work on developing the local workforce through vocational training programs and creating partnerships with businesses on creating apprenticeship programs.  Maryland should look toward specific growth areas such as cyber, which according to a CSO report in 2017 is estimated to have a 3.5 million shortage in qualified personnel in the realm of cyber security.  Virginia is pushing hard to grow its IT and cyber security work force; there is plenty of room to do the same with success, especially in the D.C. Maryland suburbs.",Yes.,"The goal of the LEOBR is noble in that it tries to protect law enforcement officers whenever they are investigated for misconduct.  However, there are some issues that do require scrutiny and possible modification.  Questioning of law enforcement officers, for example, cannot begin until at least ten days after an incident.  This does nothing except slows the expediency of an investigation.  Furthermore, punitive disciplinary action that arises for reasons other than a felony cannot be carried out until after undergoing a hearing before a board of peers.  This restricts the administrative authority of police chiefs and senior law enforcement leaders.  A comprehensive review by an independent non-partisan body is crucial in ensuring that Maryland's LEOBR balances protections for police and alleviates valid concerns from the public.",I would take on a multi-pronged approach: (1)	Work with schools in educating students of the danger of opioids and the lifetime of consequences that addicts face. (2)	Work with fellow legislators in bolstering reforms to non-violent drug crimes.  Shore up funding for treatment alternatives in lieu of incarceration for those convicted of such crimes. (3)	Work with civic and religious leaders as well as the medical industry in promoting outreach programs in weaning addicts off opioids and in providing counseling/rehabilitation services.  ,"There are so many ways to address income inequality, which in a wealthy state like Maryland is divided between those in 'skilled' and 'unskilled' jobs.  One method is to engage with business leaders and encourage the development of apprenticeship programs.  This can be done by providing tax incentives to businesses that pledge to train and hire a set number of local residents each year.","I think that it is a good start.  But to say that it is in itself enough would be short-sighted.  Marylanders deserve full transparency of their government and be entitled to review the actions of public servants short of issues that involve personally identifiable information, national security, or otherwise justifiable stated reason.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

In 1995 I started the Community Mediation Program in Baltimore.  This center has been a model on which other Maryland centers have been developed and a model which has received national attention.  In 1999, I led an organizing effort to get stable funding from the Maryland Judiciary for community mediation (still in place today) and to develop Community Mediation Maryland (CMM), which I have run for the last 13 years.  Through CMM, I have developed re-entry mediation, which is a nationally recognized model, shown by independent research to reduce recidivism.  Our centers bring mediation and restorative practices into schools, and I was a leader in the efforts to pass the Commission on the School to Prison Pipeline and Restorative Practices, on which I now sit.  We have developed unique models for criminal misdemeanor mediation, which resolve underlying issues, prevent violence, and keep people from entering the criminal justice system.  I have led efforts to create real voice for residents in engaging with police agencies.  This work has led me to all corners of the state and I have worked with the administrations of several governors.  I have passed legislation and developed agency policy that codifies several of these approaches into Maryland law and procedures.  These seeds of community empowerment and justice will continue to grow and bear fruit over many years to come.","I support most of the recommendations of this Commission and believe this creates an important opportunity to address the opportunity gap in education in Maryland. I support finding funding from some of the following sources, without raising taxes on low or middle income Marylanders: 1)	Closing corporate tax loopholes through combined reporting and instituting a ""throwback"" tax 2)	Implementing an on-line sales tax 3)	Reinstating the estate tax to pre-2014 levels 4)	Legalizing, regulating, and taxing an adult cannabis market 5)	Making casino revenue additive to supplement education funding rather than replacing general funds 6)	Increasing the percentage of Table Games profit that is directed to education ",Maryland's transportation spending is not well balanced and Maryland needs to invest more in public transit and prioritize funding to make roads more pedestrian and bike friendly. Maryland needs to increase tolls on roads and bridges back to pre-Hogan rates to sufficiently fund public transit and other transportation needs. Baltimore is not adequately served by public transit and more needs to be invested to support the needs of Baltimore residents.,"I have supported legalization of a regulated adult cannabis market for years, for its ability to decrease the number of people caught up in the system of mass incarceration, redirect funds that are currently wasted in prosecuting and punishing marijuana related issues, and bring in much needed tax dollars from taxing recreational use of marijuana. At this point, it is a no-brainer, as several states have demonstrated the potential success that I have always believed was possible. In taking this step, we should also seek to ensure employment opportunities for people who currently make their living selling marijuana in the illegal market.","It is critical for Maryland to continue to be a restoration leader amongst the Bay states and the District, even while the federal government fails in its leadership. Specifically, I believe the following programs should be continued and enhanced: a.	The Chesapeake Bay Program (CBP) is a key partner in working with and coordinating between the federal agencies, states, the District of Columbia, and the Chesapeake Bay Commission, and I'll work to ensure it has the resources it needs to succeed.  b.	I'll work to maintain and enhance funding for the best management practices that support continued implementation of the WIP, the Bay Restoration Fund, and the Chesapeake and Atlantic Coast Bays Trust Fund, to reduce both point and nonpoint pollution.  c.	Maryland should increase the area under oyster sanctuary, increase the protections within the sanctuary, and incentivize and support oyster aquaculture start-ups to take pressure off the wild oyster stock. d.	The requirement that farmers have a Nutrient Management Plan, including the phosphorus management tool, should be continued. For the process to be really effective, however, the Maryland law that shields farm-scale reporting of data needs to change.  e.	The airborne pollution coming off of a chicken farm, particularly in the form of ammonia, is locally significant and has not been effectively addressed to date.  That ammonia then falls onto the local lands and ultimately into waterways where it can be taken up by algae.  I will support legislation to regulate this pollution. ","I support single-payer health care in Maryland as the most equitable, efficient, and humane way to provide health coverage to all Marylanders. While a federal single-payer system would be ideal, the economic analysis of the Maryland data conclude that we can make it work in Maryland alone, if needed. I would also want to explore a regional single payer system, or a system including other states so that we can broaden the pool of those covered. There are several components to funding. First, the administrative costs that are saved by a single-payer system are significant and these savings become an important part of the funding package. The ability to negotiate lower drug prices will also result in significant savings. Federal funding to the State in the form of waivers, Medicaid, and Medicaid expansion dollars would go toward the system. Additional taxes on employers can be offset by the fact that they will not be paying for health insurance for employees. Employees may pay an increased payroll tax that would replace funds they currently pay toward premiums and co-pays. This should be more equitable, as lower income employees currently pay a larger portion of their salary for health care costs. We may also consider taxes on harmful substances such as tobacco or sugary foods. I am interested in reviewing a complete analysis of these sources to determine the right mix of each source.","The state should invest in housing, healthcare, education, public transit, and equitable economic development to address violent crime in Baltimore. The state should dismantle the system of mass incarceration, shifting resources from lengthy sentences and toward community treatment for mental health services, addiction recovery, job training, and community conflict resolution. Residents who have been traumatized by violence need services to heal from that trauma and transform their communities. State elected officials should also personally support grassroots efforts, such as the Baltimore Ceasefire, that reinforce community resilience.","Small businesses are the foundation of healthy local economies, a way to build family and community wealth, and to support community resiliency. Too often, economic development policy focuses exclusively on attracting multi-national corporations, which can come and go based on the best deals offered in a race to the bottom for the communities they move through. A healthy local economy has a role for large corporations and anchor institutions, but must also prioritize small businesses. I will promote policies that help develop local economies through the support and growth of small businesses, with a focus on creating wealth-building opportunities for people who have historically been excluded. Maryland should invest in training, shared-use infrastructure, access to credit, and access to markets for new and growing local businesses. Maryland business development strategies should seek to maximize local ownership and support the development of worker cooperatives. State procurement policies should prioritize locally owned businesses, those using sustainable practices, employing local workers, creating employment opportunities for people with limited opportunities, and paying living wages.","I support an independent non-partisan commission for state districts and a national commission for congressional districts, to address the gerrymandering plaguing our system. In the absence of a national commission, I support Maryland working in a compact with a majority Republican state, with both agreeing to have an independent commission redraw their congressional districts.","The LEOBR needs to be changed to better balance the needs of everyone in the community. For policing to be effective, law enforcement agencies must work collaboratively with the communities they are sworn to serve, in a mutually trusting relationship. Yet in too many Maryland communities, that trust is absent. I have been a leader and innovator in community-led policing efforts that give residents a voice in how policing happens in their communities. Community-led policing can be the key to creating a criminal justice system that reduces harm and increases justice, community safety and trust in the police. Maryland police agencies must make crime prevention and harm reduction a priority over arrest and incarceration. Law enforcement strategies should encourage partnerships and joint problem-solving between officers and the communities they are sworn to protect. All officers must receive training and tools they need to police safely and with as little force as possible. Maryland should develop and implement initiatives to bolster officer wellness and emotional well being, as well as the transparency and accountability measures that are necessary to achieve lasting police legitimacy.","Our policies on drugs must shift from criminalization to a public health approach. This requires a radical shift in Maryland's laws and our resource distribution. Several other countries and some local jurisdictions have demonstrated models for this shift. In Maryland, we have taken tiny steps in this direction, such as the development of Drug Courts, but we must shift our approach in a more comprehensive way. Most immediately, we need sufficient funding for detox in every community (many communities do not have any detox facilities) and sufficient in and outpatient treatment facilities to follow the detox. Treatment on demand must be available in every community.","Far too many Marylanders don't know where their next meal will come from, and are living paycheck to paycheck, while the income and wealth gaps continue to widen. I will advocate for comprehensive legislation to build a just economy, which is the foundation that ensures working people can support their families' futures. Economic justice includes fair pay, a $15 minimum wage, paid sick and family leave, worker protections, high quality healthcare, affordable housing, affordable childcare, and support for strong unions. State policy must support the worker training needed to advance in employment and enter new and promising industries. Maryland must also build more progressive tax policies.","These laws need to always err on the side of more transparency. In addition to the Act, the General Assembly can do more to support transparency and accessibility of the decision-making process, including streaming committee meetings online.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

In order to address its first charge, the Commission concluded that it must first respond to the second. Until specific policy recommendations are developed and agreed upon, it is not possible to assess their costs and update the Thornton funding formulas.  Once this process is complete, the Commission will be in a position to recommend the ""adequate"" funding needed for the purpose of enabling Maryland students to achieve the State's College and Career Ready standards. These recommendations will be made in the Commission's final report to be submitted during the 2018 interim. Although the Commission's work is not complete, there are some actions that the Commission believes could be taken in the 2018 legislative session to advance the Commission's preliminary policy recommendations.","I will support legislation that would provide the best results to residences  $1.97 billion investment to upgrade highways and bridges from one end of the State to the other, in order to ensure safe and reliable travel. These projects will help to address long-standing unmet highway needs and fix severe gridlock and congestion that dull Maryland's competitive edge. The State is also committed to a balanced transportation system, which includes transit investments in every corner of our state – from providing locally operated transit grants to moving a more cost-effective Purple Line forward.",I would support legislation to support recreational marijuana for medicinal usage only if it is available in Maryland.,"The Chesapeake Bay Program coordinates scientific research on the health of the Bay and provides grants to state and local governments to help reduce pollution. It's successful, bipartisan, and non-controversial—and it's a critical part of the Bay restoration efforts that are helping crab and oyster populations rebound, shrinking. Congress has passed a spending bill fully funding EPA's Chesapeake Bay Program through the end of Fiscal Year 2018. This is a critical piece of Chesapeake restoration efforts that coordinates scientific research on the health of the Bay and provides grants to state and local governments to help reduce pollution.","Health insurance carriers generally have the ability to define and adjust the number, the qualifications and the quality of providers in their networks. They also may limit the number of providers in their networks as a means of conserving costs or coordinating care. The establishment of Health Benefit Exchanges, also termed Health Marketplaces, by the Affordable Care Act of 2010 (ACA) has renewed the examination and policies set by state and federal law. The ACA requires that all ""Qualified Health Plans"" include an ""adequate network of primary care providers, specialists, and other ancillary health care providers.","The Federal Program, called the National Public Safety Partnership, will work with cities including Buffalo, Cincinnati and Houston, officials said. It is similar to an initiative run by the Obama administration that provided local law enforcement with guidance and training from Federal Officials.","I would support legislation that can and would provide aid to families and provide supervised visitation, parenting education, and functional support skills required for parents to reunify with their children placed in foster care. Home Base is seeking candidates familiar with working directly with parents with mental illness, substance use, and other impairments which cause deficits in their parenting skills.","Each state decides. In most states, the line drawers are politicians along with hired consultants. Often, state legislators draw the map, which the governor can veto. Some states have special commissions that advise legislators on drawing the map, or that serve as backup mapmakers if the legislature deadlocks. A few states have independent commissions so politicians and public officials cannot directly draw their own districts.  Gerrymandering is the practice of dividing election districts to give special advantages to one group and usually to give one political party an electoral majority in a large number of districts while concentrating the opposition's voting strength in the fewest districts possible.","Maryland and the nation are grappling with how to restore trust that law enforcement officers will treat all the people they serve fairly and equally, and that the officers can be and will be held accountable when they do not. One critical component of reform locally has to be reform of Maryland's Law. I support legislation that honors the universal declaration of human rights.  Everyone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.

If the private market fails to provide enough jobs to achieve full employment, the government must become the employer of last resort. 2.	When growth is below capacity and the job market is slack, apply fiscal and monetary policies aggressively to achieve full employment. Right now, this means not raising interest rates Pre-emptively at the Fed and investing in Public Infrastructure. 3.	Take actions against countries that manage their currencies to subsidize their exports to us and tax our exports to them.  Revoke trade privileges and levying duties on subsidized goods. 4.	Support Sectoral training, apprenticeships, and earn-while-you-learn programs. 5.	Implement universal Pre-K, with subsidies that phase out as incomes rise. 6.	Raise the minimum wage to $12/hour by 2020 and raise overtime salary threshold from $455/week to $970/week and index it to inflation. 7.	Provide better oversight of financial markets: mandate adequate capital buffers, enforce a strong Volcker Rule against proprietary trading in FDIC-insured banks, strengthen the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and encourage vigilant oversight of systemic risk in the banking system by the Federal Reserve. 8.	Level the playing field for union elections to bolster collective bargaining while avoiding, at the state-level, anti-union, so-called ""right-to-work"" laws. 9.	Maintain and strengthen safety net programs like the EITC and CTC, SNAP, and Medicaid. 10.

To paraphrase the preliminary report of the Commission, all Marylanders benefit if we have an education system that prepares all students for rewarding careers, because as education levels rise, the quality of life in Maryland will too.  The recommendations in Kirwan are particularly important to our schools in Baltimore.  The Commission rightly identifies concentrations of poverty as an immediate concern as we look at the next funding formula for our schools.  Baltimore's concentration of poverty - with 34% of students under 18 living in poverty - requires that schools be equitably funded to address the additional challenges faced by those students .    We owe it to all of Maryland's children to provide them the best education we can, and funding that education will require tough choices.  I supported creating a ""lock-box"" for casino revenue that will, if approved by the voters, require those casino revenues to supplement, and not replace, existing funding.  The General Assembly also put $200 million in next year's budget as a down payment towards Kirwan.  However, we will need additional funding to carry out the recommendations of the Commission.  I support a review of our existing tax structure, particularly the sales tax structure, to create a stable stream of funding for this important work.","Maryland's transportation spending is not balanced between roads and transit, and the Baltimore region is clearly not adequately served by transit.  The shut-down of the Baltimore Metro ""system"" this winter is symbolic of the piece-meal maintenance and non-existent development of a substantial, effective and efficient transportation system in this area that leaves thousands unable to reach available jobs.    The good news is that we have enough funds to make substantive improvements to mass transit across the State.  The passage of the gas tax in 2013 will enable us to create that substantive vision.  What is required is the will from the Governor's office to bring that about.   I was proud to support the legislation in this year's session that not only made a long-term commitment to the Washington Metro, but also mandated increases to the MTA's operating budget by $178 million. The legislation required the creation of a long-range development plan, and a comprehensive maintenance and capital improvement plan.  This is one small step forward - but the ball is now in the Governor's court to move these important plans forward.",I support giving the voters the ability to legalize possession of small amounts of marijuana for personal use by a referendum within the next legislative term.,"The federal government's ambivalence (at best) regarding the restoration of the Chesapeake is deeply troubling and disappointing.  There are signs the health of the bay is improving, in no small part because of the success lowering the amount of phosphorus and nitrogen entering the Bay due to existing environmental regulation.  When added to the Trump Administration's retreat from protection of our air, water and land across the country, it is clear Maryland must continue to enforce our own existing laws to protect our greatest natural resource.  We need a comprehensive policy to limit deforestation and plant more trees to stop harmful runoff from entering our waterways.  We should also continue to encourage the sustainable farming of oysters to help naturally clean the Chesapeake.","Maryland has been a leader in providing affordable, accessible, and quality health care for some time.  The Affordable Care Act helped to increase the number of insured Marylanders - and our uninsured rate has dropped to 6% in 2018, one of the lowest rates in the nation.  All this has been done despite the best efforts of the Trump Administration and Republican Congress to undermine and sabotage the Affordable Care Act.  The Trump Administration and the Republicans have presided over a 50% increase in individual premiums - an increase caused by their efforts to destabilize the health insurance marketplace and their elimination of the individual mandate.   During the last session of the General Assembly, I was proud to support legislation that will lower premiums for individuals in the health care market by creating a state-run reinsurance program.  Reinsurance allows insurance companies to subsidize health care costs for high-risk individuals, thus lowering the costs to the rest of the insurance market.    Unfortunately, this fix is temporary.  The State must carefully monitor the structures we have built as part of the Affordable Care Act to provide accessible, affordable, and quality health care. We must also protect Maryland's Medicaid waiver to continue to ensure hospitals focus on the patient centered model, and not on a fee-for-service model.","The State has an important role to play in confronting and lowering the frequency of violent crime in Baltimore.  State troopers are helping to serve warrants, freeing City Police officers to patrol.  They are also helping to provide protection to probation agents for violent offenders.  The State should do more, however, in a number of different areas.  My colleagues and I in the 46th District, including Senator Ferguson and Delegates Lierman and Lewis, published a set of proposals this summer to reduce violence and create safe communities. (see:  http://www.billforbaltimore.com/baltimore_prospers).  Further, the Governor should have a single point of contact in the administration responsible for coordinating State resources that are available to target violent crime in Baltimore.  There are further opportunities for the State to bring together law enforcement from both the City and surrounding jurisdictions to target violent criminals and people who possess illegal guns.    The State must also be part of the solution to restore trust in the Baltimore Police Department.  I strongly supported and look forward to the independent commission's investigation of the corruption in the Gun Trace Task Force.    Legislatively, I supported the Justice Reinvestment Act that has started to invest in treatment and prevention for non-violent offenders while lowering maximum sentences.  I also co-sponsored additional State funding for violence intervention programs such as Safe Streets, a program that has made significant progress in some of our most violent neighborhoods.  I have also supported tougher penalties for repeat violent offenders and people carrying illegal guns.","The State can foster more family-supporting jobs by supporting the recommendations of the Kirwan Commission.  All Marylanders benefit if we have an education system that prepares all students for rewarding careers.  However, improving our education system is not the only way that we can improve our business climate.  We should also invest more in adult education and programs to encourage apprenticeships.  I was a lead sponsor of the Employment Advancement Right Now, or EARN, program.  EARN makes connections between existing training programs and skill-sets needed by different sectors of Maryland's economy to produce long-term solutions to skills gap in our workforce.  We should expand this innovative program and get employees the skills they need to get better paying jobs.    I also sponsored the legislation that creates Adult High Schools.  Adult High Schools give the 700,000 Marylanders over 18 without a diploma another route to earn a high school diploma using curricula reviewed by the Maryland Department of Education and DLLR.  Adult High Schools and existing GED programs deserve more financial support as well.   We must do more to fill openings of skilled workers right as those new workers graduate high school.  This year, I sponsored legislation that allows school systems to offer high school credit for students who participate in apprenticeship programs.  These apprenticeships, at programs registered with DLLR, would have the potential to enable Maryland students to choose from either a college education after graduation, or a job for which they've already received specific training.",Yes.,The lack of trust between law enforcement and the people of our city is a large part of the reason Baltimore faces challenges with violent crime.  The convictions of members of the Gun Trace Task Force underlines the need to take a hard look at the structures that allowed the corruption to occur unchecked and unreported.  That's why I supported the Commission to Restore Trust in Policing in the most recent session of the General Assembly.    I believe there should be changes to the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights.  We should include at least one trained civilian in the trial board process and we should examine how the LEOBR contributes to difficulties in disciplining sworn officers.,"In my full-time job as an Assistant State's Attorney in Anne Arundel County,  I handle cases related to domestic violence, illegal gun possession, and felony property crimes.  Most of the felony property crimes I have prosecuted are connected to the defendant's addiction to a controlled dangerous substance - almost always opiates.  On a few occasions over my ten years as a prosecutor, defendants have not made it to trial because they have overdosed and died.    Opioid addiction and overdoses can not be solely addressed in the courtroom.  It requires a comprehensive approach connecting people to treatment, and the opportunities to change the persons, places and things connected to their addiction.       I supported the HOPE Act in 2017 which used evidence-based treatment and coordination among different agencies.  I've witnessed the growth in available Drug Court openings just this year that were created by that important legislation. Increased funding for community-based health providers will also help to provide needed treatment close to home - particularly important in a group of people who struggle with poor transportation options.    One example of a smaller, but significant, change in policy related to overdoses that I supported was in this year's Crime Bill.  A provision in that legislation adjusted the definition of drug paraphernalia to allow for the possession of ""tester strips,"" so users can test drugs for potential contamination with fentanyl.","Our state and nation are facing growing challenges related to income inequality and Maryland took steps to address this issue in the most recent legislative session.  We increased access to the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) to 18-24 year old Marylanders who don't have children. Expanding the EITC makes a real difference to working Marylanders, and helps create a pathway to further wealth.   We also took a step forward by passing the Maryland Healthy Working Families Act. I was proud to be the House sponsor for the Earned Sick Leave bill for the last four years.  Policies like Earned Sick Leave help employees keep their jobs - and keep the stability that improves the quality of life for themselves and their families.  In most cases, the longer that people stay in a job, the more likely it is for them to gain the skills to move to better paying jobs.    There are a number of possibilities to further counteract income inequality in the next term of the General Assembly.  We should raise the minimum wage and index it to the cost-of-living. We should strengthen ties to apprenticeship programs, building upon the legislation I authored this year that enables school systems to grant high school credit to students in an apprenticeship.  We must also better connect registered apprenticeship programs to sectors of our economy where there are job openings.  Most importantly, we must fund the recommendations in the Kirwan Commission's report.","State Government must operate in a transparent way.  Over the last several years, we have made strides in making government more open.  The new office of the Ombudsman within the office of the Attorney General has provided opportunities for Marylanders to have disputes related to public information requests heard, and has helped encourage government agencies to respond efficiently to requests for public information.    As the co-chairman of the Joint Committee on Legislative Information Technology and Open Government, I have had the opportunity to hear from the Ombudsman at our December meeting.  The Ombudsman proposed potential opportunities going forward, including a program that would audit responses to requests for public information by government agencies.  These audits would give agencies the opportunity to make improvements to their Public Information Act (PIA) response processes, and would allow legislators the opportunity to identify problems in compliance with the PIA in need of further legislation.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

The over proscribing of these drugs has lead to a huge increase in addiction. With the new laws on the book it will take time but I feel that less and less Marylanders will be prescribed these drugs leading to less people becoming addicted. It's going to take time and treatment but I feel that the tide will be turning shortly.,Nothing.

Rural areas may need additional funds than are presently available.  I eagerly await the findings of the Kirwin Commission.  There should be focus on pre-school where fewer than half of students are ""ready"" for kindergarten.  Parents could improve their child's outcome by reading to their child, encouraging their natural curiosity, monitoring social interaction, and challenging them with simple numerical tasks.","Moving the majority of transportation funds from roads to mass transit as was done in the mid 2000s severely crippled local governments which experienced cuts of up to 90%.  Rural areas, such as the Eastern Shore, depended on these funds to maintain roads and they received no benefit as mass transportation is non-existent.  So the answer is no.  Spending is not balanced.  I am not sure about Baltimore's mass transit issue but would support Gov. Hogan.",I do not.,I am confident that the federal government will return to its prior level of support.  This a temporary setback.,Maryland is in pretty good shape.,Baltimore needs to address the issues that produce its criminals.  It is the primary responsibility of the citizens of Baltimore and the officials they elect.  The state can provide some temporary funds to support a plan generated by the Baltimore City Council.,"We are moving in the right direction by following the lead of the governor.  Already, they are making it easier to start businesses with their new integrated website.  The best thing Marylanders can do is to re-elect Gov. Hogan.","Absolutely!  I am running to defeat a democrat in a district gerrymandered for the democrats.  Again, this is an initiative of Gov. Hogan and we need to implement it.",I am going defer on this as I would need to research.,I agree with the efforts now being put in place.,"In a society based on capitalism, there is always going to be inequality.  Accept that premise.  If you want to move up, there are many opportunities here in America that are not available in most of the rest of the world.  Be thankful you live here and are not blocked from advancement.  We are certainly out of balance by traditional measures and we need to move the lower end up a bit and the upper end down a bit.  However, we don't need to be a socialist country like many in Europe.  We can return to a more even distribution of wealth as was the case in the 1950s.","It works despite the fact that the agency charged with its implementation has no real enforcement power.

I am the Host of Public Interest Podcast and the President of Rotunda, LLC.","I support the Kirwan Commission. I agree with The Commission's recommendations and stated goals. The State's trajectory (e.g. that Maryland is listed as #1 in Student Achievement Growth) has been generally positive in moving Maryland closer to those objectives listed by The Commission. It is true that new challenges are arising throughout the State. Montgomery County has a majority-minority population, a rapidly expanding student population that is growing at a rate of 2,500 students per year, and an Achievement Gap that persists between Caucasian/Asian and African-American/Latino populations. The result of these and other challenges is that the MCPS budget has experienced increasingly difficult budgetary strains. More school construction funds are required to serve our students; greater funding is required for Free And Reduced Meals; there is a greater need in MCPS for pre-K instruction, special needs resource teachers, and English as a Second Language courses. As a member of the Montgomery County Delegation in the Maryland House of Delegates, I will work to ensure that adequate state funding continues to be allocated for public education across the state. As our State begins to emerge from the Great Recession, our legislature needs to actively manage our financial and human resources. I therefore believe that we need to maintain funding at Thornton levels so that we continue to support our pupils, Maryland's future work force, while continuing to reserve constrained resources for other priority areas.",We need to invest more in mass transit while maintaining the roads we already have. Baltimore should continue to expand bike sharing and bike lanes in the City.,"I support the use of medical marijuana and its decriminalization. I am still under the impression that marijuana remains illegal according to federal law and though the federal government is not enforcing this law in states such as California and Colorado, I believe that any attempts to legalize the recreational use of marijuana in Maryland would still be preempted under federal law.",Maryland should prohibit the export of liquefied natural gas from Cove Point and should halt all current efforts to construct a LNG pipeline under the Potomac River. If such a line were to burst it would contaminate a significant portion of the Chesapeake Bay and would result in egregious damage to the Bay ecosystem. Additionally Maryland should continue to increase its Renewable Portfolio Standard to wean our power supply off of carbon-based fuel and we should invest more heavily in the development of powerful battery technology to store and use power from renewable energy sources.,"I have introduced the Healthcare Equity, Access, Reliability, and Transparency Act (H.E.A.R.T. Act) because Taking care of the vulnerable is not only morally correct; it's fiscally responsible. We need to stop using Emergency Rooms to provide primary care to the uninsured, stop using prisons to care for the mentally ill, and start using a Public Option through universal Medicaid eligibility to cover every Marylander with whole body coverage, which will improve health outcomes and will have a positive impact on health insurance premiums for everyone else. We need to create a public option through Medicaid expansion. We need universal means tested eligibility for such a plan that would reduce premiums below market rates and introduce economies of scale seen in public plans. The creation of this plan should pool the current Medicaid population with all 500,000 public employees in Maryland by requiring state employees and incentivizing municipal and county employees to join the basic plan with whole body coverage. This plan has been endorsed by former Maryland Health Secretary Van Mitchell and two former Governors of Maryland.",Maryland should expand Mental Health Courts and Drug Courts across the state. Marylanders in a mental health crisis who present no risk to others deserve the chance to get their lives back on track through these special courts. Maryland also needs to begin stemming the tide of illegally procured firearms that flow into the city. Gun owners should be held criminally liable for crimes perpetrated with a gun registered to them regardless of whether they were involved with the crime. If gun owners sell their gun on the black market and that gun ends up being found at the scene of a homicide then that gun owner should be held criminally liable for straw purchasing a gun.,"Maryland's business climate is somewhat attractive because of the thriving communities, high quality of life, and superior public education infrastructure that we provide to business owners and their employees. I will fight for Montgomery County to bring back our fair share from Annapolis. Each year we send our tax dollars to the state and each year we get back only 20 cents on our tax dollar. It's important to use our resources to help raise all boats in Maryland but we can and should do better when it comes to procuring state funds for school construction, mass transit, and utility infrastructure due to the greater burden posed by our high population density. 2. Public Childcare 1. Childcare can post a significant financial burden to new families that often results in one parent leaving the workforce. Providing public childcare for children ages 0-5 will allow both parents to continue to contribute to the economy. 3. Opposing Corporate Welfare a. Revoke tens of millions of dollars in tax-credits for corporations with thousands of employees.",Yes. I oppose gerrymandering in all of its forms. Ensuring that districts are drawn fairly in a non-partisan manner will translate into improved representation. Redistricting reform will do much to restore voters' confidence in our electoral democracy.,Yes,"Many legislative solutions to the opioid crisis focus are reactive after someone decides to use opioids. Clean needle exchanges, the prescription drug monitoring program, and methadone clinics are fine but we need to address the underlying problem leading people to use these drugs. In addition to reducing the over prescription of pain medications by medical professionals we need to find ways to build communities that do not result in social alienation and loneliness. We need improved mental healthcare to prevent addictive behaviors.",We should have free access to community college across the state and we to invest more heavily in vocational training to produce a workforce with hard skills that they can use to earn income in a new economy.,"Declining press coverage in Maryland has led to diminished accountability of lawmakers. We should investigate the creation of a BBC-like network that is funded by a dedicated sales tax on computers, phones, and televisions (devices used to access news) that would create an independently funded investigative news organization.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

The General Assembly took the first step this year by setting aside $200 million to put towards these initiatives. Looking forward to the final report later this year so we can find ways to properly support these essential initiatives.",Redistributing the Highway User Funds back to pre-recession levels to the local communities is essential for our entire state to move forward with our transportation initiatives. The state has committed over $450 million to ease congestion on the Baltimore Beltway. The state also recently committed and assisted with the emergency repairs of the Baltimore subway system and has made a significant financial commitment of the DC Metro system.,"This decision ultimately could be left up to the people of Maryland, by way of referendum. This is not just an issue isolated to Maryland but also our surrounding states as each year other states have enacted legalization initiatives. However, Maryland needs to stabilize the medical marijuana initiative that has been plagued by controversy from the beginning. That being said, all of this may remain moot unless there are changes in regards to the classification of Marijuana on the federal level.",Thankfully the EPA recently restored funding to the Chesapeake Bay however Maryland will continue to protect the Bay even if the Federal government wavers in their commitment.,Maryland recently passed legislation to stabilize health care in Maryland for the short term however this issue must be addressed federally going forward so that truly affordable health care is available all Marylanders throughout the state.,"Maryland will continue to support Baltimore as well as all communities throughout the state in addressing violent crime. Focusing on Repeat Violent Offenders is a good first step to addressing this epidemic. However, at the same time, a focus on the socio economic issues that create and manifest these violent outbreaks must be examined to determine how we can help curb the violence before it begins.","Maryland's business climate is much improved. According to the Sun, Kauffman Index Latest Growth Entrepreneurship Report, Maryland ranks fourth nationally in growth of entrepreneurship. Moving forward, Maryland must address and begin to lower their Corporate Tax Rate in order to be more competitive with other nearby states.","Yes, gerrymandering has been issue within our state for far too long. Clearly the maps were previously redrawn in an unfair manner. Going forward, it is essential that a non-partisan body is able to look and redraw these maps to ensure far elections and proper representation throughout the state of Maryland.","Yes, the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights does balance protection for those in law enforcement and the public. Any changes would need to be negotiated with all parties involved; the state legislature should not be used as a vehicle to circumvent or bypass that process.","The opioid and overdoes crisis affects communities not only throughout Maryland but across our entire nation. We need to focus on putting away the high volume dealers, provide resources for treatment to the addicted, and work towards job creation and societal integration with the rehabilitated.",The best thing that Maryland can do to address income inequality is to put that energy and focus towards education. An educated community translates into a skilled workforce which attracts sustainable businesses and that is what ultimately overcomes income inequality.,"There has been legislation presented in the past that would require the General Assembly to make available to the public live and archived video streaming of each meeting of the Senate of Maryland, the House of Delegates of Maryland, and a standing committee of the General Assembly, including any hearings or voting sessions. This needs to continually pushed until enacted to give more Marylanders the ability to view these proceedings.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

I was the area director for the Professional Referral Exchange.","I fully support the findings and funding of them. As promised when casinos were first discussed, a significant portion of monies were to be used strictly for schools, and not in lieu of budgeted funds. Our students are our greatest asset. We must make sure they have all the necessary tools to learn. This commission laid out ""9 Building Blocks for a World-Class Education System"". As the world is changing, we must change as well to give our children a leg up and be competitive. We in Maryland should have top rated schools, not in only the country, but globally as well. An educated populace will be the only way to keep our democracy alive.","While the Baltimore Link is a positive addition to the transportation aimed at the Baltimore area, a look into how surrounding counties will be affected and how to tie them into ancillary bus routes and the MARC system is necessary as well. The addition of lanes in heavily traveled areas during peak times is a bandaid, albeit one that will help at this time, but we need to think future-minded and how MDOT will be able to come up with alternatives via mass transit. There also needs to be more cooperation between county bus lines or integration of lines.","I am in favor of controlled distribution of recreational marijuana in authorized stores. Many individuals are going to other states for recreational marijuana and we are losing out on tax income. With legalized marijuana, there will be less incarceration for minimal amounts and more control of the substance itself.","The Chesapeake Bay is a very important part of our state and must be protected. Together with New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware and Virginia, we all need to take steps and increase funding for its protection for now and the future. State and federal funding should be used to clear the upper side of the Conowingo Dam as much debris comes from the Susquehanna which begins in New York State, hence the partnership with other states. More dredging needs to occur with the Corp of Engineers to clear more waterways.We need to help those who are farming oysters to help the bay with the natural cleansing of the water. The bay is improving, we need to continue to do this as it is necessary to our future.","I believe everyone should be able to have affordable health care. Preventative health care many times prevents disease and catastrophic illness due to early detection. The ACA was a good start and Maryland has been looked to as a leader, we must try to find other ways to keep and have affordable health care for all. An example would be HealthCare Access Maryland, where navigators help individuals and families find affordable healthcare. There are many other ways to address this concern, all of which have pros and cons and will need to be evaluated.","We need to provide avenues for respectable wages, jobs, and beautification of neighborhoods. Let us look to those cities where the crime rate has been turned around and the neighborhoods are beginning to thrive. We need to provide help to create access to healthier living ie: community gardens, community centers to help parents and children to develop their strengths.","We need to be more competitive with surrounding states. Look for tax breaks for companies that are or will fix infrastructure as part of their plan of development. Make it more assessable for filming of movies/TV shows who paint Maryland in a positive light. Continue more training and help for entrepreneurs or entrepreneur hopefuls, as well as in areas where our state shines, such as technology.","Yes, however, it needs to a non-partisan, independent body.","The only changes I believe should occur are: when an investigation is in process, an investigator from another agency should definitely be called in to work with the in-house investigator.

Regulations, infrastructure, transportation, taxes and public education all need to be evaluated to encourage businesses to locate and grow in Maryland.",I agree with 73% of Marylanders that Maryland needs a nonpartisan redistricting process that ensures free and fair elections. As a Delegate I will vote for Gov. Hogan's proposal for a nonpartisan commission to draw up Congressional and Legislative districts after the 2020 census. When we work together Maryland citizens win.,"Law enforcement is a dangerous job. My wife's cousin was shot in the line of duty. Law enforcement, like public officials should be free to perform their jobs without the fear of civil lawsuits. However, no person should be immune, if they violate someone's civil rights. We must ensure that all law enforcement officers receive the necessary education and training to be able to properly respond to situations they encounter on the street.","Maryland declared a state of emergency in response to the heroin, opioid, and fentanyl crisis soon after Gov. Hogan took office. I support the Opioid Operational Command Center to coordinate state and local agencies, impose a Prescription Drug Monitoring Program, limit the amount a health care provider can prescribe, and strengthen laws to impose strict penalties on distributors of fentanyl. We must work with medical practitioners, law enforcement and pharmacists to educate the public on the potential for addiction and abuse. We also need to work to end the stigma of addiction so more people will seek help.",If what we care about is inequality of opportunity then we need to stop hampering the ability of Marylanders to get ahead.

I support the findings of the Commission. I believe these reforms can be funded through the operating budget and the dedicated funding from casinos. This session, the General Assembly passed legislation that begins to implement the recommendations of the Kirwan Commission, starting in the fall of 2018. House Bill 1415 modernizes Maryland's educational system by improving teacher recruitment, getting more resources to students in low-income schools, and expanding career technical education programs. This legislation encourages the top 25% of high school graduates from each county to pursue a career in education and increases awareness of financial aid programs for teaching candidates. It also implements an Early Literacy Program in low-income areas to help students build a strong reading foundation and expand pre-k to give children the head start they need. Further, the bill creates a competitive grant program for local boards of education to partner with community colleges and businesses to put students on a track for careers in technical education. It's important we encourage more young men and women to get involved in the hands-on technical careers of tomorrow.","We need to balance all sorts of competing budget needs -- in education, transportation, public safety and other areas. Generally, I believe we should spend more on transit than we are currently spending. The cancellation of the Red Line was a travesty. As I do not live in Baltimore, I am not familiar with Baltimore Link. I live in Montgomery County and rely heavily on the Metro. Clearly, Baltimore is not adequately served by transit in comparison with the DC Metropolitan region.","Not at this time. But, I do support further use of civil offenses for possession and use of marijuana. I believe it is important to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of legalization in other states before we move in that direction. We are beginning to receive studies on the effects on traffic accidents and other public safety issues which need to be reviewed before Maryland moves toward legalization.",We need to continue to work with our neighboring states to craft compacts for the protection and restoration of the Chesapeake Bay - until those running the federal government regain their senses and make protecting our environment and the bay priorities again.,"The Maryland legislature took important steps in the 2018 legislative session. Specifically, a legislative workgroup on the Affordable Care Act worked on lowering premiums in the individual market by seeking a federal waiver for flexibility to use federal funds to help create a state-run reinsurance program. Reinsurance will allow insurance companies to subsidize the cost of care for high-risk individual market enrollees and curb the premium increase from having substantial effects on the rest of the insurance market. Last year, under the Hogan Administration, insurance premiums increased by 50%. This year, the legislature stepped in to prevent another 50% increase. This legislation was passed by the General Assembly and passed unanimously out of the House of Delegates. The legislature also passed legislation authorizing the State to collect the 2.75% ($380 million) in suspended federal fees from insurance companies to pay for a state reinsurance pool. The bill also requires a study to explore further long-term solutions for the insurance industry and stabilization of individual market rates.","During the 2018 legislative session, we passed several legislative initiatives to help Baltimore address violent crime. The most important legislation resulted in the creation of the Maryland Violence Intervention and Prevention Grant Fund (HB432) and provided funding for the Safe Streets program (HB113). We cannot incarcerate our way out of violent crime. ""Tough on crime"" failed in the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s. We need to be ""Smart on Crime,"" which means we need to ensure access to job opportunities, training, housing, and education. However, the legislature also passed bills to provide law enforcement and prosecutors with tools to crack down on crime. SB1137 allows prosecutors to obtain wire taps in illegal gun sale crimes; increases the penalities for witness intimidation; and adds fentenyl to the volume dealer statute.","Maryland's busines climate is healthy and strong. But, there is always room for improvement. Bringing more businesses to Maryland and supporting our strong medical systems will foster the creation of sustaining, family-supporting jobs. Maryland retains its AAA bond rating. It is one of only eleven states in the country to receive the highest possible rating from all three rating agencies – S & P Global Ratings (formerly Standard and Poor's), Moody's Investors and Fitch Ratings. The rating agencies cite Maryland's strong and diverse economy, well-educated work force, above average wealth and income levels, sound financial management, and initiative and flexibility in response to economic cycles. The high rating enables taxpayers to benefit from lower interests rates for our State's capital investments - which results in more jobs.",Yes.,"The Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights (LEOBR) was crafted almost 30 years ago. I do believe that it balances protections for the police and the public. However, trust between the police and the public over the past several years has eroded in many areas. The legislature has taken up LEOBR reform measures over the past several years - particularly in 2016. It is a complicated area of law. Reform will require both sides at the table -- and, in many cases, would be more effective at the local level so that specific police practices and policies are reformed and community trust reestablished.","This year the legislature passed bills to establish a competitive grant program that awards funding to local behavioral health organizations to expand capabilities of crisis response programs and services. Services and programs include: mobile crisis teams, 24/7 walk-in services, crisis residential beds, and other crisis response programs. Total funding for annual grants begins in 2020 at $3 million, $4 million in 2021, and $5 million in 2022. Additionally, this legislation requires pharmaceutical drug companies to file reports of suspicious orders to the Attorney General's office. Drug distributors are already required to file these reports with the federal government, this law simply requires the distributors to file the same report to the state to assist the state in combating the overdose crisis. Reasons to file a suspicious order report include: shipments of abnormal size, frequency or deviation from the normal shipment pattern.","The state should continue supporting businesses to encourage job growth. In 2016 we successfully passed equal pay legislation. The bills prohibited employers from paying different wages based on a person's sex. Maryland's Equal Pay for Equal Work law prohibits compensation discrimination based upon a person's gender identity. Further, the law generally prohibits employers from paying a wage to employees of one sex or gender identity at a rate less than employees of another sex or gender identity ""if both employees work in the same establishment and perform work of comparable character or work on the same operation, in the same business or of the same type."" Employees are deemed to work ""in the same establishment,"" and thus subject to comparison, if they work in the same county, even if they work in different offices or locations. In addition, in response to activists seeking employment protections beyond just wages, the Act prohibits employers from ""providing less favorable employment opportunities"" on the basis of sex or gender identity. Examples of ""less favorable employment opportunities"" include: (1) placing employees into ""less favorable career tracks"" or positions; (2) failing to provide all employees with information regarding promotions or advancement; and (3) limiting employment opportunities that would otherwise be available to the employee but for the employee's sex or gender identity. We need to continue to monitor implementation of this important law.",Yes - I believe our Public Information Act (PIA) and open meetings laws adequately ensure Marylander's ability to exercise oversight of the government. We can improve Marylander's access to the government by continuing to improve our use of technology through live video streaming of general assembly sessions - as we now do for House and Senate committee hearings.,"Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

Maryland State Delegate Ways and Means Committee – Education, Elections, Revenues, Finance Resources Subcommittees, Joint Committee on Children Youth and Families, House Chair - Howard County Delegation","I support the Kirwan Commission fully. I have been attending their meetings and they have been moving carefully toward very positive funding and policy reform. The current findings, as well as the direction the committee is taking for the future of education, are excellent ones. This year I worked in Education Subcommittee to help enact legislation to support early recommendations. These include initiatives to attract and keep teachers, with attention to attracting a diverse teacher workforce, and also programs to increase early literacy. Going forward, I see the attention to increased funding for English language learners, students with disabilities, and students in families at or near poverty levels as very positive and necessary. Additionally, the commission is moving toward a more universal offering of Pre-K to 3 and 4 year olds. In 2017, I sponsored a bill forming a work group, on which I served, to gather information on the logistics of full Pre-K offering for Kirwan. Kirwan will likely suggest significant increases in educator salaries, a great idea to attract and keep the best. The funding for all this can be found in the education trust fund, which, with the help of the voters in 2018, will be constitutionally locked as additional funding for new educational initiatives and construction.","Maryland's current focus on transportation spending is badly skewed toward road projects. The transportation trust fund, which was so controversially funded by a gas tax, has been used almost exclusively for roads in the last 3 years. The focus on the future is on roads as well: from widening the Baltimore Beltway (new lanes tend to fill in 2-3 years), to creating toll lanes on I-270, and a $9 billion dollar plan to add second deck toll highways. Too little attention is paid to creating and maintaining affordable and accessible public transportation around the state. The cancellation of the Red Line was the opening salvo in this shift away from public transportation. This Red Line alone would have helped the workforce at Social Security, reinvigorated neighborhoods in Baltimore, and even provided a future possibility of public transportation to Tradepoint Atlantic. BaltimoreLink, while having a nifty logo, has provided little in the way of innovation and change. As a bus system, it is still subject to our current traffic problems and very few significant changes were actually made. The hint of negligence in the recent need to totally shut down the Owings Mills to Hopkins line makes it clear that we have a need for a paradigm shift in transportation policy and a redeployment of the transportation trust fund money.","Yes. Like so many other states, I feel the time has come to acknowledge the proliferation of cannabis here, to regulate it, and recognize it as a valuable revenue source. If we legalize adult use, we will be able regulate its presentation and sale with age limits and dosages. We will have better control of who purchases and uses it. As important, we will be able to list dosages so individuals will can self-regulate. In the same way that beer and alcohol list percentages and proofs, those who partake will be able to manage their use with information. Additionally, the revenue from taxation of sale and manufacture will provide a source of income that can be used for public education and treatment for those who find it difficult to control their use of harmful drugs. Greater enforcement of public use, particularly use while driving will be possible. Centers for treatment can be funded and advertised. Overall, legalization will give us greater control over cannabis use and ameliorate the problems associated with it.","The Chesapeake Bay is not only a beautiful natural resource, its health is also closely linked Maryland's health. First, it is a recreational gem and provides a myriad of outdoor activities for those in our state contributing to their quality of life. As important, it is a vital economic driver for us. Many industries, from seafood supply to tourism rely on a clean Chesapeake. The question is how to be good stewards of the bay. We need to create and protect oyster beds, maintain the crab population, and keep our fishing resources intact. We must move toward better phosphorus management and cleaner waste management with incentives. Even our air quality effects bay health. We must take further steps to regulate smokestack and vehicle pollution, here and in neighboring states. This takes money and we will do our part, but we must continue to get the federal government, particularly the EPA, to cooperate. The leanings of the federal government away from assisting us with this are disturbing, to say the least. We had this fight and won, in a limited way, at the outset of the current administration. We also need the cooperation of our neighboring states, something that can be accomplished with our efforts as well as that of the federal government.","We have taken several steps already and there is more to be done. Maryland's unique waiver creates a system of charges for hospital services that keeps costs even, regardless of place of access, which is a big equity factor. We have also taken several steps to control prescription drug costs. We passed legislation allowing a pharmacy or pharmacist to provide a beneficiary with information regarding the retail price of a prescription drug or the amount of the cost share for a prescription drug. This awareness will help control costs. Going forward we need to reintroduce legislation to create a prescription drug cost commission to determine how to make prescription drugs more affordable for state residents. We must also move on to the bigger challenges. The removal of the individual mandate from federal tax law will mean higher costs for health insurance. We will need to introduce a manageable mandate at the state level and control health care costs. Then, going forward, it is time for us to take a serious look at single payer health in Maryland. No one should be without adequate health care - it is a human right.","The state needs to offer whatever support we can to the city, without impinging on local control. These initiatives are best left to the Baltimore City delegation in Annapolis, as well as the city council and the mayor. I will honor and support what they, as the knowledgeable representatives of their jurisdiction, feel will be the most effective.","Maryland has a strong business climate and that is due to its workforce. We have one of the strongest educational systems in the US, from k-12 education right up to college and workforce development. We attract businesses based on the workforce this creates. We go further by offering tax incentives to 21st businesses like cybersecurity and biotech, while keeping our strong and present businesses, like Marriott, Northrop Grumman and Tradepoint Atlantic, with incentives for job growth. We also support small businesses with a myriad of job and apprenticeship creating incentives. For job creation, merely stating how many new jobs are created in a given time period is too clumsy a statistic. If it takes two of these jobs to support a family then, in my mind, these two jobs only count as one. The jobs we create must be those that provide a living wage and reasonable work conditions. We passed, despite the governor's veto, a mandatory sick leave bill. This will, I believe, ultimately strengthen the continuity of our workforce and be an ultimate benefit to the businesses they work for. We will take a serious look in the future at an increased minimum wage. We will need to initially provide small businesses with some relief to help them provide these well-deserved and badly needed measures at work. I sponsored a bill this year to begin the establishment of a living wage for education support personnel on the basis of the need for continuity and fair treatment.","I believe we need more compact and fairly drawn districts. One of the great dangers of unfairly drawn districts is that voters feel powerless and disenfranchised. Voting may be suppressed. The most significant thing we can do to advance the democratic process is encourage voters to the polls. Drawing more representative districts will do that. The process needs to be as non-political as possible, a difficult task, but one that can be accomplished with a fair appointment process to a commission that would draw the district lines.","The LEOBR, enacted in Maryland well after the 1975 court ruling, is controversial on both sides. Some argue it helps to protect officers from disciplinary actions, making them feel less accountable. Others argue that it actually suspends some due process protections that should exist for officers. In any case, the arguments are clearly responses to some bad actors. There are perceptions in the community and in the police force that a single policy will not change. What is needed is significantly better communication and understanding of the need for law enforcement and its limitations. Community meetings and outreach to community events and schools by law enforcement will help the population to see officers in a positive light and will ensure that law enforcement understand the communities they are sworn to protect.","The most important place to stem the spread of addiction and overdose is at the source. We need to control opioid prescriptions and we are doing that by simply raising physician awareness, but there is certainly more to be done. The prescription drug management plan (PDMP) that allows doctors to monitor overall drug use by a single patient is an important tool and we need to encourage doctors to use it. We also passed legislation in 2017 that requires a health care provider, on treatment for pain and based on the clinical judgment of the provider, to prescribe the lowest effective dose of an opioid. The quantity must be no greater than needed for the expected duration of pain. We also passed legislation that requires pharmaceutical drug companies to file reports of suspicious orders to the Attorney General's office and have funded a local grant program for behavioral health organizations to expand capabilities of crisis response programs and services. These sorts of checks on prescriptions are essential and need to be furthered. Doctors' offices that are essentially ""pill mills"" need to be regulated or shut down. Public education on the dangers of opioid access in the home, as well as programs for disposal and safe storage, need wide support.","Income inequality is a huge issue of national breadth, but I will speak to what we have done in the past several years to stem some of the causes of this inequality in Maryland in gender, race, and middle to lower class communities. We have taken several measures to move toward fairer hiring and salary practices. In particular, the legislation to limit employers from gathering information on past employment compensation is a good step. This helps stop the continuance of lower pay for the same jobs of certain races, ethnicities, and genders. Going forward, we can incentivize creating workforces that are representative of the population in our communities. Additionally, I have supported workforce training measures to help create new jobs for communities that have lost major industries so that no one in Maryland falls behind.","Generally speaking, our public information laws are very thorough. It is when they are violated that we sometimes have trouble with enforcement. Take, for example, the trouble the public had with getting document information from the Howard County School System. The county delegation tried several avenues to get intervention on the state level, with some success, but not enough to fix the problem. The problems were clear, but it took the election of a new board in 2016 to create better compliance. There need to be clear paths to fixing and stopping violations immediately.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

Strong public schools are essential to our democracy, to our economy, and to providing opportunity for upward mobility. As we work to bring Maryland's public schools back to best in the nation and to being competitive worldwide, we must ensure that all schools and all students get the resources they need. Education resources must be allocated according to student needs, recognizing that schools with greater concentrations of students living in poverty need additional services to support those students. As important as it is to provide schools with the resources necessary to support educating students living in poverty, it is equally important to recognize that, to achieve the most positive educational outcomes, we need to broaden our focus beyond the school system to getting those students and their families out of poverty. We will not close the opportunity gap in our classrooms until we start to close the opportunity gaps in our society. In this context, living wage, health care costs, transportation, and affordable housing are all education issues. The recommendations are ambitious and will be expensive to implement, but they are critical to Maryland's future. I reject the argument that we cannot afford to fully fund education. We cannot afford to underfund education any longer. One important step is for the voters to approve the Fix the Fund Act on the ballot in November, and another is to stop diverting public dollars to private schools.","While managing automobile traffic is a critical component, we must shift more of our transportation planning focus to comprehensive solutions that decrease our dependence on single-occupancy vehicles. This applies to how we plan for both transit and roads. The cancellation of the Red Line was a significant loss for the Baltimore region, and I do not believe BaltimoreLink adequately fills the gap. I am committed to working on better transit solutions for Baltimore and connecting the greater Baltimore region. As we look at regional transit connections, we need to provide convenient, reliable alternatives to automobile commuting including shorter wait times, extended hours of service, better integration of bus and rail systems, and options for bus rapid transit. We must shift our planning for roads beyond automobiles as well. Maryland should adopt and implement complete streets policies to ensure safe and convenient routes for pedestrians and cyclists. Significant transportation improvements could be made with reprioritization of existing resources.","Yes, I support legalizing recreational marijuana. Keeping marijuana in the criminal justice system is a bad use of public resources. Legalizing, regulating, and taxing marijuana for recreational use is a more appropriate approach. As we work to establish a regulated market for recreational marijuana, equity and inclusion must be forefront in our efforts. For decades, the criminalization of marijuana has had disproportionate impacts on communities of color. We must work to eliminate barriers to participation so that those communities most harmed by the past criminalization of marijuana have an opportunity to participate and prosper in the new regulated market.","Restoring the Chesapeake Bay is critical. In the absence of federal leadership, we must recommit our state efforts. Despite significant progress, we are still not on track to meet our 2025 pollution reduction goals. Each of the primary sources of nutrient pollution (agriculture, septic systems, wastewater treatment plants, and stormwater) presents unique challenges. Stormwater is the fastest growing cause of pollution in the Bay, and the tools for successfully battling stormwater pollution already exist in the proper enforcement of the most recent round of MS4 permits, which included specific measurable targets for amounts of treated impervious surface. MDE must ensure permit compliance. For agriculture, which is the largest source of nutrient pollution, soil conservation and water quality plans must be properly implemented. However, these plans set minimum requirements, and we should be working with our farmers to go above and beyond those requirements with proactive sustainability initiatives. As agricultural land preservation efforts reach their limits, I would propose expanding the allowable uses of the agricultural preservation portion of transfer tax revenue to support implementation of such initiatives. For septic systems, we must require use of best available technology (BAT) and proper ongoing maintenance. Finally, one important step we must take to protect the Bay is strengthening the Forest Conservation Act. I was disappointed to see the proposed legislation this session diluted to a technical study and programmatic review. Deforestation is devastating not only in its impact on Bay pollution, but also on air pollution, biodiversity, and climate change mitigation.","Health care costs are growing at unsustainable rates, far outpacing income growth and thereby decreasing affordability for an increasing number of Marylanders. Access to health care is a universal right, and affordability should not be a barrier. We must have a health care system that closes gaps in coverage, reduces the costs imposed on patients, delivers true person-centered care, and eliminates health disparities. I support a single-payer system as a way to achieve these goals. A single-payer system would offer savings in a number of areas: reduced administrative costs compared to private insurance companies; reduced administrative costs for health care providers based on streamlining of claims and billing procedures; and correcting market leverage to reduce the cost of health care services and pharmaceuticals. Additionally, improved access to preventative and primary health care will help decrease the current over-utilization of high-cost health care such as hospitalizations and emergency room visits. These savings will ultimately translate into reducing the burden that health care expenses currently place on Maryland businesses as well as savings and improved health care access for individuals and families. Implementing single payer health care in Maryland will be no small feat. It will require an unprecedented level of coordination, collaboration, and critical thinking around health care financing and health care delivery system reform. I believe Maryland is up for the challenge. We can and should be a leader in this area.","First and foremost, we should ask Baltimore how we can help. We need to listen to Baltimore and Baltimore's leaders and representatives so we can provide meaningful support, not simply impose our own initiatives. I look forward to working with my colleagues from Baltimore.","Maryland has a strong business climate, and there are a number of steps the state can take to foster the creation of more family-supporting jobs. The first is to commit to family-supporting jobs. Maryland offers a wide range of tax credits and breaks, financial assistance, and economic incentives to attract businesses to locate in Maryland. In doing so, we should be selective and only give credit for truly family-supporting jobs. I do not believe the current standard of 120% of minimum wage is high enough. In addition, Maryland should insist on family-supporting jobs in awarding state contracts. When the state provides a public subsidy of any type or invests public dollars through its purchasing power, I believe the state has a responsibility to leverage that public investment for the maximum public benefit, and insisting on quality family-supporting jobs is one important way to do so. Another important aspect of fostering the creation of more family-supporting jobs is to invest in education – preK-12, community colleges, and our university system – as well as work force development programs. One specific focus in this area should be requiring state contractors to have certified apprenticeship programs.","Yes. It is the job of the voters to elect their representatives, not the job of the elected representatives to select their voters. I would support this reform as well as other small-d democratic efforts including public campaign financing and initiatives to increase access to and ease of voting such as same-day voter registration and voting by mail.","The Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights (LEOBR) was initiated to protect police officers from unfair management practices and disciplinary actions in retaliation for union activity. I strongly support such protections for law enforcement and for employees in any sector. The same protections, however, also apply for investigations and disciplinary action in cases of police misconduct, and in some cases, LEOBR has become a topic of significant concern regarding public trust and accountability. The public needs to have confidence in the accountability of its police force, and police officers must have due process. It may be time to review certain aspects of LEOBR, but police officers must be at the table as full participants in that review.","Addressing the opioid addiction and overdose crisis requires strong commitments to both treatment and prevention. We need to allocate the necessary resources to offer adequate addiction treatment services including inpatient detox and rehabilitation and continuing outpatient rehabilitation, counseling, and support. When people struggling with addiction are ready to seek help, we cannot afford to put them on a waiting list. We urgently need greater access to inpatient treatment beds. On the prevention side, education is critical – education of the general public, of parents, and particularly of physicians and patients regarding pain management. Medical marijuana and non-pharmaceutical treatments such as acupuncture could be critical components of a comprehensive solution but are often unaffordable because they are not covered by insurance. We must ensure that better pain management alternatives to opioids are accessible to all patients.","Unfortunately, the General Assembly missed an opportunity to make significant progress toward this goal by failing to pass the Fight for Fifteen legislation to increase the minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2023. The United States has the greatest income inequality of any major developed nation, and of the states, Maryland is in the middle of the pack. The recent federal tax changes will only exacerbate these conditions. With the revised federal tax plan in effect, this is a prime time to evaluate Maryland's tax policy and examine the total tax burden on families at different income levels.","I believe the Public Information Act (PIA) and the open meetings laws give Marylanders the ability to exercise oversight of the government; however, I believe improvements could be made to make it easier to exercise oversight of the government. One factor which can limit access is the cost of the fees associated with PIA requests. Given current technology, I believe more could be done to make data and documents available online and facilitate individuals' ability to search for information independently so that PIA requests would not be necessary in as many instances. I would also be interested to hear from the media and from advocacy organizations what obstacles they have experienced. Of course, there is an important distinction between adequate compliance with the laws and the adequacy of the actual laws. I would be seeking feedback both on enforcement concerns and on any changes in the substance of the laws that would enhance transparency.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

Any great society invested and encouraged education for its citizenry. Some of the most advanced and best suited for future successes are nations are those investing in their education systems today. We support the findings of the Kerwin Commission. Many of these policies they recommend could not easily be implemented within the current budget. As we need to find extra resources for these programs, we will need to make cuts to old programs throughout the state that are not working. We also believe that if gambling revenue taxes were actually supplemented to education funding, we could use these proceeds to implement those goals. We also recognize that the money spent on these programs could create an initial cost but will likely result in a reduction of expenditures in social assistance programs in the future. The programs could very well save the government money over time.","I think Maryland tries to weigh the general balance of transit and infrastructure for transit. I think the attempts are difficult but tend to lean towards transit. However, one cannot deny the symbiotic relationship between transit's success and reduction of vehicles requiring roads. Metro has been a tremendous help to our traffic concerns in the greater area. However, systems need to be improved upon and maintained. I think we are not doing the best of job of maintenance of Metro, which discourages people to use the system. That lack of faith in the system can result in more use of vehicles, creating more traffic. I personally believe that Prince George's County needs to get the ""red line treatment."" As someone who lived in a rural area southeast of Prince Georges, it was tough to get to transit stations and thus driving became the most efficient way to get into DC. However, our campaign is proposing increasing metro services to Upper Marlboro and Bowie. These locations will likely reduce car traffic by almost 100,000-200,000 cars, which also improves the life of our connecting roads. Baltimore, to become a model city, has work to do in the transportation department. However, there are many concerns about the cities fleeing population. Perhaps investment in the city to its vital infrastructure will entice citizens and business to relocate back to the area.","Yes, I believe it can be a source of incredible revenue for our state. Not that I am an advocate of everyone and their mother using the drug. I do not support many people from drinking alcohol but that is legal and the revenue created is valuable to the state. Colorado added hundreds of millions of dollars to their annual budget from marijuana sales. Much of that revenue in Colorado went to education. The result, they are building homes at record rates to keep up with demand, they have seen huge increases to tourism revenue, fatalities from opioids has dropped significantly, as has violent crime. This industry is a billion dollar industry. We should remove the criminal enterprises from controlling such a large industry and regulate and tax instead. The Volstead Act proved that illegality of behavior that is commonplace will only result in organized violence, gangs, and lawlessness. I believe it is safer to regulate the businesses and create a capitalistic system that can fund the resulting problems that arise from those markets.","We have a duty and a responsibility to protect not only our bay, but also our environment at large. We have numerous problems to address in respects to our environment, the largest is addressing climate change. The science is clear. It is time to work on creating an energy grid that is carbon neutral and renewable. It is time we put people over the quarterly profits of a business that won't exist if the planet is not habitable. It is time companies that have contributed to, disregarded, and created false narratives over the years about climate change be brought to justice and pay penalties. There are many policies that we will put into place for our environment. The first will be setting an energy portfolio of 100% renewable energy by 2040 for our state. We will offer incentives to green technology companies to relocate to our shores an invest in our green economy. We will invest in various projects to clean our rivers and bay that include oyster projects, banning single use plastics, solar powered trash wheels, water run off projects, and state-wide recycling initiatives. We will continue the progress started in the legislature to invest in green power and technology. We will also make sure that we hold fossil fuel companies responsible and accountable by implementing requirements on current facilities for added safety and environmental purposes.","Healthcare has become incredibly expensive and small business is affected the most. My wife and I own our own business. Because we are married, the law only treats us as one person for purposes of obtaining group insurance. While we are only ""one person"" for obtaining group insurance we still pay deductibles as individuals for ourselves and our daughter. I am sure that many small businesses have this problem. If you are not in small business, you may be having problems with the premiums for health insurance. I am of the belief that as long as health insurance is solely tied to profit and not patient care, healthcare will continue to be subpar in America. We pay more per capita than anywhere in the world and receive healthcare services that are not even ranked in the top 10 of nations. Healthcare is a problem that hits home regardless of race, economic status, religion, or creed. Healthcare needs to be affordable for all. Healthcare should be available for all. I support legislation that would create incentives and subsidies for citizens to purchase healthcare and help alleviate the costs. It would be a large undertaking to implement our own healthcare system within the state and we would likely be lacking in the diversity of the patient pool to make it effective. However, I would be open to discussing those options with financial experts to see if it were something viable for the State.","The state is bound by the constitution's police powers to take care of the health and safety of its residents. The state must play a role. Per capita, Baltimore is setting records for 343 homicides in 2017. The USA Today named Baltimore the Most Dangerous City in America. Crime is not a problem that is fixed in a single policy. It is an approach that requires a multi-faceted approach. However, there are examples of us to learn from not too far away. Washington D.C. used to be the murder capital of the country not too long ago. I remember those times well. D.C. started by doing a few different things. They encouraged travel with a world class transportation system, Metro. D.C. started numerous projects for redevelopment in Southeast Washington, among other projects. Baltimore could very easily invest in certain neighborhoods and grow the town outward from the inner harbor. We also need to address those at-risk communities at early ages. We need to have role models for young men to emulate. We need investment in young people in schools. Instead, youth jails are being built. We need to create opportunities for our young people for work and in academia. Finally, we need to work with specialized crime teams to stop large scale crime. The state has a role to play, but it does not start and stop with just violent crime. It will require investment in our citizens. We will invest in our State.","Maryland is incredibly fortunate to its proximity to our Federal government. Many have a decent standard of living that warrants and supports the need for numerous local businesses. There are many business friendly policies that can be put into effect. One such policy is student loan deference for young people starting businesses. We also want to create funds that can invest in young businesspersons in their businesses. We give many large businesses millions of dollars in tax credits. In reality, we would be better of helping small mom and pop businesses throughout the state. We would also create tax incentives for small businesses that encourage businesses to hire local employees that live with certain distances of work. Ultimately, large businesses need to pay their fair share of taxes so that small businesses and individuals can pay less in tax. There was a time in America when businesses paid over 30% of our Federal budget. Today that number, prior to the recent tax cuts, was about 10%. After, it will probably be something like 5-7%. If big business is not paying their fair share, citizens will be forced to pick up the difference. A more equitable tax structure will help citizens innovate and created businesses that benefit more workers. I am a tax and business attorney. Starting businesses is easy, maintaining and running them is the hard part. We need to create policies to make the operation of businesses easier and less arduous.","Yes, I support non-partisan and independent bodies to draw our legislative and congressional districts. Redistricting will occur within my term when I am elected in November. Gerrymandering is one of the major topics that I believe Democrats need to address as a party. Simply put, Democrats have fixed the game in Maryland. Republican congressional candidates received about 38% of the state vote in the last election. They have 1 out of 8 seats, 12.5% of seats, in Congress. Reasonably, they should have 2 or 3. As a democrat, Democrats need to lead the country and demonstrate that when we are in charge, we will play by the rules. Once we do so, we can push to gain numerous seats across the country that have been drawn similarly by Republican controlled legislatures. In office, I will encourage and advocate for congressional and legislative districts that are drawn that result in compact districts that allow for perfect representation even if it results in losing my seat. It is the right thing to do.","At the very outset of reviewing the Officer's Bill of Rights it mentions the Public 9 times. 8 of them are within the title pages on each of the pages. The only time the word public is mentioned is in Section 3-112 regarding emergency suspensions. It allows for suspensions with pay when it is in the interest of the public and law enforcement. Police is mentioned 26 times and Officer is mentioned 131 times. Simply put, I do not believe that the current draft of this Bill of Rights adequately balances protections for the public. The public should have more input on disciplinary actions that occur that result in the physical harming, injury, or death of a citizen while in police custody or in the process of being arrested. Citizens should have an ability to review the behavior and action of their police departments and render opinions that could used as evidence in a court of law. Ultimately, our police are here to protect and serve our communities. Many of them perform this duty. I believe that more civic engagement is required to have better communications between the force and the communities they serve.","Opioid addiction claimed over 50,000 lives throughout our country in the past year. That is just roughly 8,000 fewer deaths in the Vietnam war. This is something that has become an epidemic. There are many ways to address the problem of opioid addiction. The first is to treat this as a public health crises and not a criminal matter. Drug courts have been incredibly successful in foregoing charges while requiring treatment. Ultimately, treatment is the key to getting individuals off of these drugs. There are medical and mental health professionals who are more versed than I to make the recommendations on proper treatment. We also need to look at the pharmaceutical industry and ask why opioids are being so frequently used. Most are prescribed after a surgery or a vehicular accident. Once addicted people purchase these drugs on the street. The addiction becomes very expensive and then turn to heroine which is about the same drug but 1/4 the price. The rest is history. Breaking the cycle is difficult. We must be cautious about prescriptions. I would advocate for tracking prescriptions for individuals and doctors. We must also review the drug rep process that essentially ""bribes"" our doctors to write extra prescriptions when they are not needed. The process is not easy to break. It requires someone with a view of the entire system and to create checks and balances at each stop to eliminate the effects of drug addiction. We are dedicated to policy to do just that.","Income inequality is becoming a growing problem in our state and in our nation. Since the great recession the gap between rich and power has grown exponentially. Wages between these groups is stark. There are many in the nations elite including Peter Georgescu, immigrant self-made millionaire, who is concerned about what an economy looks like without 80% being able to afford their basic resources without going into debt. There needs to be a shared value of labor and the public companies. All to often large businesses are indebted to their board of directors and shareholders and not creating standards for the very labor force producing the revenue. One of the main ways that we can address this is increasing options for labor unions in the state. Labor unions have provided their workforce a fair portion of the productivity of their labor. It is time most Maryland workers have that option as well. Others methods could be to increase the minimum wage to a livable wage. In most literature that number seems to be about $15/hour. Raising the minimum wage is only part of the equation. We could also set requirements that companies share annual year growth, stock, with their employees. The 20th Century was about growth of Democracy and Capitalism. The 21st Century will be about either improving the capitalistic system or watching its demise. I hope that we in Maryland will create an environment that allows capitalism to perform and citizens to reap the rewards.","Currently, there is no central agency for making public information act requests. It requires people to reach out to the proper governmental body to determine where their request occurs. Most people, myself included at times, struggle to find the proper agency or office to address. Most people ultimately weigh the time and just forget their complaints or it takes a long time. In my view, government accountability and transparency should be made easy and accessible. We believe that a central agency for handling requests and providing information to the public should be created. There is no such agency for Public information Act requests. If you have any requests, they will point you in the proper direction. We could allocate current staff from other agencies to the position and would not affect the budget. However, it would create an easier troubleshooting process for citizen requests. We would also advocate that they have a web presence to take requests via the website, email, and by phone. Maryland citizens should not have to have a second job, have a law degree, and spend an extraordinary amount of time to keep government accountable and transparent.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

,YES,state-house,41,Angela C. Gibson,Gibson,3/21/1949,Baltimore,Democratic,Baltimore City,,,,,"Morgan State University, B.S.",Former Government Relations Officer for 29+ years with Office of Mayor (Baltimore City) working with Baltimore City Council,"I support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education. As a Delegate in the General Assembly, I have a once-in-a-generation opportunity and reasonability to establish a world-class education system for all Maryland students. The number one problem our schools face is the chronic deficiency in funding. According to state analysts, Maryland public schools are underfunded by billions of dollars. In order to bridge this gap in funding, I supported legislation mandating casino revenue be placed into a 'lockbox' to go towards spending above and beyond the state's K-12 educational funding formulas. In addition, the last time the school funding formula was updated was 2002 and I support updating the school funding formulas, with a focus on schools with high concentrations of students living in poverty, for example, most public schools located in Baltimore City, and for special education students.","I recently supported and voted for legislation requiring the Governor of Maryland to allocate an extra $178 million over three years to Maryland Transit Administration (MTA), the state agency that operates the subway in Baltimore. In addition, this bill instructs the MTA to report its needs to the legislature over the next four years and develop a much-needed long-term plan for services in its ""core service area"" in the Baltimore region over the next 25 years. In my opinion, this should included revival of the canceled Red Line project. Both the State of Maryland and Baltimore City needs to stop subsidizing personal vehicles and parking garages over smart growth, public transportation and alterative transportation alternatives such as bicycles, walking and ridesharing. Baltimore City must embrace a viable transportation network, which levels the playing field between personal vehicle transportation and walking, biking, and public transportation. Unfortunately, due to economic and racial discrimination and prejudice, many our City's residents have been left behind when it comes to economic opportunities and the transportation required to economically prosper in our City. Only when we embrace smart growth and transportation options that all residents can easily have access to, will we have a City where economic and personal health is not exclusively tied to what neighborhood you were born in or currently reside",I support the legalization of recreational marijuana. If it is controlled by the government perhaps it would minimize the quality of life crimes that occur .,"The Chesapeake Bay is a vital natural, economic, recreational resource for all Marylanders, including the residents of the 41st District. I support funding, on the federal, state and local level that is directed towards improving the health of the Chesapeake Bay and reducing various sources of pollution. As Delegate, I am proud of my support of various measures passed by the General Assembly to fight President Trump and Congress' assault on the Chesapeake Bay and the environment. For example, I voted for legislation that prevents Maryland from being withdrawn from a regional partnership to fight climate change known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative without legislative approval. I support the recently passed Maryland Healthy Soils Program and former Governor Martin O'Malley's regulations requiring all new septic systems to use the ""best available technology"" (BAT) to reduce nitrogen pollution from septic tanks that harms the Chesapeake Bay by creating ""dead zones"" in the Bay. I oppose the expansion of large and industrial size poultry farms on the Eastern Shore. These farms are not family farms, but large corporate conglomerates and should be regulated appropriately. In addition, I support a moratorium on chicken farm construction on the Eastern Shore until the environmental effects of these farms on local communities, the Chesapeake Bay and waterways can be adequately researched and studied.","Despite the Trump Administration and the Republican's repeated sabotage of Obamacare, Marylanders have been signing up for coverage in record numbers. Maryland's uninsured rate has dropped to 6% this year, after being as high as 14% prior to 2010. I am proud to state I fully back our leadership's plans to protect all Marylanders' right to quality and affordable health care. I support the Affordable Care Act Workgroup, which is working to lower premiums in the individual market by seeking a federal waiver for flexibility to use federal funds to help create a state-run reinsurance program. Reinsurance will allow insurance companies to subsidize the cost of care for high-risk individual market enrollees and curb the premium increase from having substantial effects on the rest of the insurance market. This year, I voted to prevent another 50% increase in insurance premiums. In addition, I voted for the Health Care Access Program, which authorized Maryland to collect the $380 million dollars in suspended federal fees from insurance companies to pay for a state reinsurance pool. It also requires a study to explore further long-term solutions for the insurance industry and stabilize individual market rates.","Crime in Baltimore is simply at an unacceptable level. Baltimore as a diverse and inclusive community cannot truly grow and prosper at the current crime level. When Baltimore is not a growing and prosperous city, it harms the entire State of Maryland and the two parties. The City of Baltimore and State of Maryland must partner and work together to identify precise solutions to various problems that ail the city. However, this uptick in crime did not happen in a vacuum and we cannot simply arrest our way out of this problem. As Delegate, I have worked to ensure state resources are used in an equitable fashion to reduce crime in Baltimore, especially in regards to police misconduct and reducing gun violence. I supported legislation that creates provides police powers for State's Attorneys in order to investigate police misconduct, and expungment for non-violent felonies so non-violent felons can better integrate themselves into society after serving their sentence,. I supported a strategic crime package that includes expanding wiretapping authority for prosecutors on gun investigations. It also increases penalties for witness intimidation and includes a provision to help prosecute volume dealers of fentanyl, a lethal opioid. Mistrust in police is at a toxic level in Baltimore City and that is why I supported the creation of special state commission with subpoena power to conduct a 20-month investigation into Baltimore police corruption. The Restore Trust in Policing Commission is in response to corruption in the police department's Gun Trace Task Force.","I consider the business climate in Maryland as good and conducive to business growth. However, much of this business growth in Maryland has been uneven with the fruits of economic growth not reaching many Marylanders, particularly those Maryland citizens of color. To foster the creation of more family-supporting jobs, i.e. jobs with a livable wage jobs with benefits. I support a $15.00 minimum wage in our high cost metropolitan areas (Washington D.C. suburbs and Baltimore) and projects that create skilled training opportunities and apprenticeships that would drastically increase chances of citizens for skilled living wage jobs that pay $15.00 dollars an hour and provide benefits. Those who are chronically unemployed, on government assistance and the formerly incarcerated would receive a special focus from my office when it comes to job training and re-training. We must have corporation and collaboration with our corporate, medical, educational, and technological communities. We need to help Marylanders obtain the skill set for and land jobs in these well-paying sectors. I would work with our previously mentioned private partners, and public partners including local community colleges and various local, state, and federal government agencies to push this goal forward. In addition, when a companies such as Amazon and Under Armour is asking for substantial tax dollars to complete their headquarter projects, they should be willing to invest in the community, and hire local skilled labor with the opportunity for those citizens who are not skilled become skilled workers.","I support and will vote for a new process for drawing district lines, such as non-partisan or independent commission, i.e. California Citizens Redistricting Commission, that will take the politics of redistricting.","As currently constructed, the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights does not adequately balance protections for police and the public? If elected, I will work with our State Delegation to reform the Police Officer Bill of Rights to provide more transparency to misconduct hearing process. Shedding light on both the accusations and dispositions thereof will provide necessary information to our citizens as to people who are sworn to protect them. Baltimore City taxpayers have a right to know who are the good apples and the bad ones. This way we can hold our Police Department accountable for ensuring that the police officers with a history of misconduct are weeded out of the system. In addition, I will work towards increasing community inclusion and collective voice on oversight boards to establish community advisor boards.","The combat opioid addiction and overdose crisis is a health care and mental health crisis, not a criminal one, and I support using government resources to combat the crisis from that point of view. To combat the opioid epidemic, I supported the Behavioral Health Crisis Response Grant Program, which establishes a competitive grant program that awards funding to local behavioral health organizations to expand capabilities of crisis response programs and services. In addition I supported Controlled Dangerous Substances – Distributors Reporting Suspicious Orders Act that requires pharmaceutical drug companies to file reports of suspicious orders to the Attorney General's office. Drug distributors are already required to file these reports with the federal government, and this law simply requires the distributors to file the same report to the state.","As a catalyst through the past protection and promotion of racist political and economic policies, the State of Maryland has a duty to address and correct income inequality. This can be achieved by supporting Maryland Historically Black Colleges and Universities, drastically increasing funding in public transportation, education and job training for a 21st Century Workforce. The $15 /hour minimum wage needs to become a statewide initiative.","Maryland's Public Information Act and opening meetings laws does not adequately ensure Marylanders' ability to exercise oversight of the government. When the government conducts business in secret, the lack of transparency inevitably and inherently breeds distrust of our public officials. There is evidence that all levels of Government in Maryland frequently violate the open meetings laws. Numerous bills are filled in Annapolis regards to strengthening Marylanders' right know when it comes to how their government conducts business, and I am in favor of an extensive review of Maryland's Public Information Act and opening meetings laws to study if meets the needs of providing the public information in the 21st Century and an examination the best open government practices throughout the country.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

The bill passed and the funding will begin in the fall of 2018. It is important to understand that the work of the Kirwan Commission is not yet complete; they requested and were approved for additional time to make final recommendations to the legislature on how to improve Maryland's public education funding system. HB1415 also advances some of the early recommendations of the Commission including a comprehensive teacher recruitment and outreach program, early childhood education programs, and extended day academic programs. I also strongly support the recommendations of the Knott Commission, which focuses on school facilities. Education is the ticket out of poverty and the State of MD must ensure a good, free public education to all children according to the State Constitution. Our children must be equipped with the tools needed to make sure they can compete in the world, whether it is by way of higher education degrees and certifications, or in the world of career technical education and vocational skilled trades. Funding education must always be a priority for the State budget. Additionally, we must also use every opportunity available to supplement the State budget as the legislature did this past Session with HB1697, the Education Lockbox bill. This bill will provide for a ballot question in this year's elections for a constitutional amendment to ensure that revenue from casino gaming will be specifically earmarked for education.","Our State transportation spending continues to be a political football. Many of us disagree with the Governor that it is not a wise expenditure of taxpayer dollars to simply widen 295 and it took far too many years to decide to rebuild the Nice Bridge, now to be named in honor of Senator Middleton. This is the reason why the legislature passed a bill in the 2017 Session that required a specific scoring system for all transportation projects. It is always critical that the taxpayers are allowed to have much needed input into discussions that focus on transportation projects in local jurisdictions; this was not the case with the Governor's decision to cancel the Red Line project and instead replace it with a poorly thought out BaltimoreLink system that created havoc with Baltimore's public transportation. The Mobility System is in serious need of improvement for our disabled community. Again, a much needed first step for any decisions regarding transportation needs and improvements, is to have a well thought program of providing a system of public discussions and debates so as to determine what the public needs are.","I do not support the legalization of recreational marijuana at this time for the State of Maryland. Since being elected in 2006, I have been focused on ensuring that citizens in our state have access to a well constructed program of medical marijuana. In 2014, I was successful in getting legislation passed that established the medical marijuana program that we now have in our state. That legislation required the Medical Marijuana Commission to actively seek racial, ethnic, and geographic diversity when making decisions on the awarding of licenses. Unfortunately, the Commission, which is named after my Mother, the Natalie M. LaPrade Medical Cannabis Commission, failed miserably to live up to the requirements of the legislation. 15 licenses were awarded for Growers, and 15 licenses were awarded for Processors and only one company was owned by African Americans. Not only was there no diversity, the geographic diversity was also non-existent. As a result, one of the priorities of the Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland under my leadership, was to have additional legislation enacted that would ensure the racial, ethnic, and geographic diversity needed for the State of Maryland. This Session we were successful in getting House Bill 2 passed as emergency legislation and it is now awaiting the signature of the Governor to be effective immediately. I am very proud of the work we did in a truly bipartisan way to make sure that the Medical Cannabis program in the State of Maryland is an example for the country to follow.","I am very proud of the efforts the State of Maryland has made over the years to continue to protect the Chesapeake Bay. We recognized how very important the oyster habitation is to the cleanliness of the Bay and we enacted laws needed to protect and strengthen that system. We also enacted what came to be known as the ""Rain Tax"" so that the proper protections would be developed when considering impervious surfaces. We have also ensured that all jurisdictions have appropriate plans in place to make sure that any development projects have protections in place for any runoff possibilities of toxic materials into the Bay. It is imperative that we continue to try to promote and encourage a regional system of plans to protect the Bay with our neighboring states of Delaware, Pennsylvania, Virginia, D.C., New Jersey, and New York. Efforts of such planning have been attempted over the years, but those efforts are not as successful as we would hope because those states, in large part, have not focused, as Maryland has, on protecting the Bay. We must continue to encourage our Congressional Delegation to make every effort to make protecting the Bay the priority that it should be.","I am very proud of the work that the Maryland State Legislature has done over the years to make sure that our citizens have affordable health care. We passed legislation to make sure that our citizens who were uninsured, were able to sign up for health insurance as a result of the much needed reform of Obamacare. We have also passed legislation to make sure that our children have access to health care regardless of the economic status of their parents/guardians through our CHIP Program. Several years ago, when it became an issue that far too many children did not have access to dental prevention and attention, we passed legislation to make sure that the majority of our children would not suffer the devastating effects of the inability to have the proper access to good dental programs. We also passed legislation in the 2017 Session to expand the authority of our Attorney General to allow him/her to bring lawsuits, if needed, against pharmaceutical companies for price gouging of prescription drugs. This was a first in the country. In the 2018 Session, we passed House Bill 1782 Health Insurance - Individual Market Stabilization (Maryland Health Care Access Act of 2018) and House Bill 1795 Maryland Health Benefit Exchange - Establishment of a Reinsurance Program . Both bills were signed into law by the Governor. These bills continue to protect Maryland citizens against the devastating decisions of the Federal Government in their continued attempts to derail the Obamacare program.","I am very proud of the collaborative efforts made in the 2018 Session to not only take steps to increase penalties and hold accountable violent repeat offenders who possess guns in the commission of violent crimes, but we also were able to include in the budget $41.6 million of funding for programs that have successful records in preventing acts of violence, such as Safe Streets and Outward Bound. Since the Police Department is a State Agency, we have a responsibility to ensure that our law enforcement officers operate in such a manner that the public would have the level of trust needed to assist where and when needed with crime prevention. This comes through proper multi-cultural training and having an appropriate Civilian Review Board, that includes representatives of the public. We must continue to appropriately fund witness intimidation programs so that the public will not be fearful of being informants of those who ravage our streets with crime. More importantly, the State must adequately fund education and recreation so that our children have the skills and talents needed to keep them in positive productive programs that monopolize their time. Jobs, jobs, and more jobs are needed for our young people during the summer, and for our adult population. If people don't have employment opportunities, then they are more likely to turn to criminal acts in order to provide for their homes. There are long-term needs and short-term needs that we must continue to develop in order to reduce crime.","Maryland's business climate is good but can be better. Ensuring that we have an appropriate minimum wage, state-wide, is an essential element of a good business climate. Now that the Legislature has ensured that most workers will have paid sick leave, and if we can pass a bill that will raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour, that will go a long way to taking proper care of our workers. Businesses are more successful when the workers have decent salaries and working conditions. The workers make it a priority to give their very best to the job if the job shows that it cares about the workers. Workers can then take care of their families, and purchase goods and services locally; most importantly they can buy homes which supports the tax base for the localities. As a state, we must continue to explore how we can best compete for lucrative businesses that will bring more jobs to our state. For example, Amazon, Offshore Wind and Medical Cannabis, are extremely lucrative businesses that have the potential to employ thousands of Maryland citizens, but we must ensure that all of our citizens can compete for the jobs. It is also extremely important that we improve the preparation and training of our returning citizens so that employment is almost a guarantee; this will make it more likely for these citizens to have the necessary means to provide for themselves and their families and not return to crime.","Absolutely! I strongly believe that a non-partisan commission should be established that would include members of the legislature from both the Democratic and Republican parties, representatives of the faith community, community activists/leaders, representatives of the NAACP, the ACLU, labor unions, and others that may be appropriate. The mission should be to propose legislative and congressional district maps that make more sense that what we currently have for our districts. It should be a priority to make sure that the districts should have a like community of interests. It is also very important that the districts should allow for the citizens to have easy access to their representatives.","The LEOBR absolutely needs to be changed. There must be a better way of ensuring that all officers are held accountable and responsible for their actions. The Police Commissioner is held accountable for all of the officers, as a result, the Commissioner must be able to, if needed, apply disciplinary actions, including up to termination, as an end result of any officers found guilty of egregious and heinous actions. The Civilian Review Board must be strengthened by the addition of additional representatives of the public in order to build trust in the community. Without the trust of the community, it is very difficult for law enforcement officers to successfully discharge their duties.","Treatment not incarceration is one of the many options to address this issue. Life saving drugs need to be available in every jurisdiction; and people who have loved ones who are addicted, need to be trained for emergency application of these live saving drugs. There should never be a limited supply of life saving drugs, as we are now experiencing. There should also be more investigations of doctors who over prescribe addictive drugs, without appropriate monitoring of those drugs. There are studies that show positive results when using Medical Cannabis to treat opioid addiction and as result, the State of Maryland should add opioid addiction as a qualifying condition for treatment.","First and foremost, the State of Maryland needs to recognize and accept the fact that in our state government, we have far too many cases of income inequality. A task force needs to be commissioned and charged with the responsibility of taking a comprehensive look at this issue. The results of the task force should then be developed into legislation that would begin to put measures in place to decrease and ultimately eliminate income inequality. Once this process is in place, the State needs to look at how to best use the same system for private industry, and perhaps use incentives to engage businesses to use best practices to eliminate income inequality.","I believe that Maryland's Public Information Act should be strengthened by making it easier, as long as the proper justification is presented, for the general public to obtain information. I do believe that Maryland has done a very good job of updating our open meetings laws to help the public have more access to our legislative proceedings. Just about every meeting of the legislature is available online for those who cannot join us in Annapolis.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

One of my more important goals is to increase funding targeted towards low-income and impoverished students and schools. To achieve this I would provide secured, 'lock-box' status of public education funding, re-direct BOOST voucher program money away from subsidizing private schools, ensure that all money generated through gaming for our education system is used only for public education, and levy more stringent taxes on high net-worth and ultra high net-worth individuals and 'carbon' taxes on businesses that generate greenhouse gases to provide more economic resources for public education funding.","No it is not, more money is spent on highway development over what's needed for public transit. The cancellation of the Red Line project, disparaging low-income communities predominantly of people of color, was a huge step backwards in what we should be doing with our state's public transportation sector. BaltimoreLink, so far, has only marginally increased efficiency, yet any amount of increase is great; however, ridership has remained static thus showing no positive growth in it's ultimate goal. I do not believe that Baltimore is adequately served by it's public transit system.","Yes, I do.","I believe that Maryland should strive for developing and fulfilling projects through the Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP). In addition to strengthening the RCPP, Maryland needs to adopt legislation and regulations that have a much greater impact on environmental polluters such as an effective tax levied on greenhouse gas producers and strict regulations enacted on industrial farms limiting ammonia discharges and managing phosphorus use in fertilization.","The Maryland government needs to regulate the pricing of all prescription drugs in addition to health care services through direct and aggressive negotiating with providers. Move towards a single-payer healthcare system and along with these, offer drug ""safe havens"" free from legal repercussions, staffed with medical professionals, with an emphasis on rehabilitation that can be provided effectively.","-Kickstart community programs instilling inclusion. -Enact various methods of reducing--and optimistically, eliminating--poverty through job and career growth opportunities, free trade skill programs, and the provision of a basic income to combat inequity. -A prospering public education system. -Developing and maintaining a trustworthy law enforcement presence in higher crime locations: install officers as members of these communities--as people who care for whom they're supposed to protect, promote response of understanding over violent responses in law enforcement training, strict regulations for accountability through body camera usage.","I believe that Maryland is very business friendly, with complaints mostly directed towards high income tax rates which I want to address with a revised income tax structure based on economic impact. I think that the state should implement regulations regarding adequate parental leave, legislation for a regularly indexed living wage, and support employee childcare either through potentially subsidized on-site facilities or by facilitating partnerships with local childcare providers.","Yes, I absolutely do.","I believe that the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights (LEOBoR), as it currently is, serves as a detriment to the public that LEOs are employed to protect. There needs to be a lot of reform with Maryland's LEOBoR: - Repealing of the 10-day waiting period in regards to internal questioning of officers under investigation, allowing for more transparency to the public and adequate investigating. - Repealing of the 90-day window for filling excessive force complaints. Civilian review boards should also be instituted to assess and assist in conducting LEO investigations to further support accountability, transparency, and trust.","I think one of the most pertinent subjects--that feed into this--that must to be addressed is poverty. Along with addressing the issue of poverty is providing quality, effective and affordable, if not free, opioid rehabilitation centers where medical professionals oversee public opioid treatment in ""safe zones"" that are open access and free from legal repercussions. The main goal would be rehabilitation, yet before people can reach that point, there needs to be a foundation of trust and motivation. The least we can do is fund overdose treatments and preventative measures such as Naloxone for overdose reversal and fentanyl test strips.",- Enact legislation for a regularly indexed living wage. - Eliminate the power of salary negotiation in the job interview process. - Reform the income tax system to be based on economic impact. - Regulations for businesses to provide salary ranges of job positions to prospective employees and full internal employee salary transparency.,"No, it's not enough. The government should push to provide Marylanders with information in line with government transparency, such as: - Ease of access for people of different backgrounds and abilities (computer literacy, language barriers, etc.). - Access to the full historical voting records of their representatives. - Expedience in the process of information dissemination. - ""Snapshots"" of the political views of their representatives and candidates provided at polling places. - Transparency of the specific processes used when determining the drawing of district lines.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

Common sense reforms included in the report such as universal access to high quality Pre-K programs for 4 year-olds and targeted programs for at-risk 3 year-olds, increasing teacher salaries to recruit and retain high quality educators in Maryland, increasing the number and options of Career Technology Pathways and more comprehensive supports of our underperforming schools are moral, social and economic investments in our future as a state with proven returns. I do believe that significantly more funding will be necessary to implement the suggestions of the Kirwin report. Certainly, appropriate funding revenues from gaming proceeds that will augment rather than supplant the educational budget are a start. Other ideas may include an increase in sin taxes including tax revenue from marijuana in the event of legalization and impact fees on developers. I also believe that fulfilling the promise of better public schools should be prioritized over support of private schools. I have spent most of my adult life fighting for better public schools for ALL students and will continue to have that as my primary objective in Annapolis.","Baltimore and its suburbs need an expansion of faster, safer and more frequent public transportation options. I would support funding the Red line and other mass transit opportunities to help Baltimore compete for job opportunities with other similarly sized cities. Better public transit would also help reduce emissions in the cities where many children suffer from asthma and other respiratory and health problems. This is not only a public safety concern but an economic and environmental one as well. The Baltimore CityLink bus program does not seem to have adequately solved the mass transit problems in the city as promised.","I do support the legalization of recreational marijuana. I believe that regulation and taxation of marijuana may help solve some of our crime issues, produce revenue for important priorities and provide a new industry for our workforce and farmers. As a psychologist, I am convinced that the public health concerns of marijuana pale in contract to the long term social and economic effects of tobacco and alcohol addiction.","The most serious threats to our state environment are directly related to the repeals of regulation and under funding of monitoring designed to protect our environment at the federal level. However, I strongly believe that it is possible for action at the state level to mitigate some of these effects and I would strive to actively do so as a Maryland State Delegate. A healthy Chesapeake Bay is essential to the identity, economic growth and recreational activities of our state. In particular, I would support efforts to keep our water clean and control development along waterways and in soil sensitive areas. I would promote rural land preservation programs and require adequate forest buffers and better monitoring of nutrient management systems to keep nutrients from the Bay. I would fiercely oppose any efforts to drill for oil along our coastline. I believe that we can further mitigate agricultural and developmental impact on the Bay by imposing impact fees on new development and limiting development in sensitive areas. Working with the extension service to help farmers limit fertilizer and pesticide run off and to limit pesticide use through risk/benefit analysis is also important, as is training in sustainable practices. Regulations for the storage of manure from poultry farms should also be a legislative concern. Cleaning up the inner harbor with trash wheels is a good start but a ban on plastic bags and Styrofoam in the city would have an immediate impact on overall pollution in the city that affects the Bay.","Access to high quality health care including reproductive and mental health care is a basic human right. We fail to protect our citizens if their basic health care needs are neglected. Lost wages, job immobility, and lack of preventative care take an economic toll. In the short-term we must reinvigorate the ACA to ensure no lapse in coverage. Eventually we need to move toward a single payer system to provide essential care and negotiate with insurance and pharmaceutical companies to get the most economical plans for our state while reducing paperwork of health care professionals. A multi-state consortium may make the market size more financially viable. Private insurance may still play a role to augment coverage in situations which involve ""quality of life"" issues.","My work in early intervention with families in crisis has convinced me that preventing violent crime starts with supporting families and providing for the child care, health care and educational needs of our most vulnerable citizens. We need to ensure a living wage and ample job training programs to reduce familial stress and engage with communities to encourage networks of neighborhood organizations and better relationships with law enforcement. It is impossible to address violent crime, however, without common sense gun control measures and increased access to mental health and evidenced-based drug treatment programs. We are confronted with a generation of children who have literally had their brain functioning altered because of exposure to violence and poverty. Systemic racism and income inequality make this issue challenging but I believe that change is not only possible, it is morally obligatory and in the best interest of all of us.","Maryland should continue to invest in training and re-training programs for our workforce, pass a minimum living wage of $15 an hour with future indexed increases, help encourage worker productivity with better childcare and leave policies and expanded public transit. CTE and PTECH expansion within the public education system should continue to be a priority to ensure that Maryland public school graduates are prepared to enter the workforce and contribute meaningfully to their communities.","Yes, I do support a non-partisan committee to redraw our district maps after each census. Gerrymandering is an unfair process that strips citizens of their constitutional right of representation.","Certainly, there are ""bad cops"" just as there are negligent or abusive workers in any other professional field and these should be weeded out and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Law enforcement officers face stresses every day that most of us can only imagine and are engaged in activity that is going to naturally lead to a high number of inquiries. For that reason I do believe that the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights is important for internal investigations, with the caveat that the public should be allowed access to the proceedings, though not necessarily serve on decision-making panels. In addition, officers should be given the advanced training that they need to make swift, safe decisions in high stakes situations. I would support significantly more professional development in deescalation, systemic racism, and disability awareness and the effects of early trauma. Officers should retain body cameras and have more intensive training in use of force decision-making. The state should also provide enhanced mental health and general wellness supports for officers and their families.","The opiod crisis must be addressed with a two-pronged approach. First we must deal with the vast numbers of Marylanders already struggling with opioid addiction. As an emergent public health measure, we need to actively promote widespread distribution of Naloxone much in the way that knowledge of CPR and the distribution of defibrillators have been employed to reduce cardiac death. The state should adequately fund evidence-based treatment programs and this care, in addition to mental health care, should be considered an essential health care need. This includes narcotic replacement therapy which has been demonstrated to be effective in controlled trials. Addiction treatment must be more accessible than opiods obtained either on the streets or by prescription. Second, we must aggressively prevent new cases of addiction. While the number of narcotic prescriptions in the US has fallen since 2010, we remain the world leader in prescription narcotic use. The CDC has made a strong statement on the issue with new narcotic prescription guidelines. We must support physicians in limiting overall narcotic use. This includes encouraging alternative methods of managing chronic pain and addressing those aspects of the physician/patient relationship that provide pressure to prescribe more heavily.","To ensure income equality we must close the achievement gaps in our public schools between students of different races, disability statuses and economic situations. Early intervention and screening programs for low income and at-risk children and Universal Pre-K will be a first step. Supporting a living wage and access to high quality child care and health care, in addition to ample job training programs will strengthen families and communities. Promoting businesses in poverty stricken communities and subsidizing access to quality services, arts, and recreational activities are also important steps towards rejuvenating neighborhoods and reducing inequalities.","The public has the right and responsibility to know how and why decisions are being made and how their tax money is being spent. I support the Open Meetings Act but would like to see a higher level of transparency, accessibility, and accountability of policy and law makers to the public. Too often decision makers are not adequately responsive to their constituents. In this era of technology, there is no excuse for limited communication to or from state government. As State Delegate, I feel that my experiences on both sides of this issue, as a parent and advocate and a policy maker, will certainly inform this discussion and I will strive to be as responsive as possible to my constituents.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

Instead, to help all children to be prepared for kindergarten as recommended in the report, I would support a program that gives new mothers of poverty, education on parenting skills and the importance of reading to children every day. I also support concentrated efforts on families of poverty, not spreading the money thin on Universal Pre-K which would lead to low quality Pre-K for all and not enough support for our poorest families.","I think Governor Hogan's administration is doing their best to balance transportation needs with the current budget on transportation. The budget, however, falls way short of the needs to move people and products most efficiently. For decades, Maryland highways have not been improved as the population has substantially grown. Governor Hogan's Traffic Relief Plan will improve the lives of many who travel through and commute to work in the DC area. Expanding I270, I495 and MD 295 with optional toll lanes will give our state the most bang for the buck. The plan also provides a way to fund it with public/ private partnerships, which I think is a smart solution. I do not feel that Baltimore's transit system is adequately served, but other improvements should happen in Baltimore where you start to see population growth before it makes sense to add to the transit system. I would, however, like to see the Howard Street Tunnel enlarged so it can accommodate double stacked shipping containers because the Port of Baltimore has a disadvantage when trucks can't get through the tunnel, and opportunity is lost as a result.","No, I really don't think legally adding another mind-altering drug (in addition to alcohol) will benefit our society. We have enough problems with alcohol and drug addiction. I don't see how marijuana will help families. Instead of legalizing a drug, why don't we promote things that are good for families like reading to a child at bedtime, or taking a walk after dinner, or exploring one of the many museums in Baltimore? There are so many other healthy things we can do to stimulate or minds instead of chemically changing our brains. In addition, there is still no reliable test such as the breath test for alcohol, to tell if someone is under the influence while driving. The state would be liable if they legalized marijuana without having a way to enforce safe drivers on the road. Another reason I oppose legalization is that there would still be a black market for the high potency types of marijuana so we'd still have some of the same problems we already have with illegal marijuana.","It is vital to protect the Chesapeake Bay, to keep our drinking water clean and to support our seafood industry and conserve our natural resources. As stewards of the earth and its resources, we must do all we can to protect our ecosystem as well as the industries that rely on a clean Bay. The federal government has fully funded the EPAs Chesapeake Bay Program, which is great! As a State Delegate, if projects are not fully funded, as someone who has a record of solving problems in my community, I would work with elected officials, advocates, scientists and other stakeholders to find ways to protect the Bay and it's watershed.","Health care is one of the top four issues for my campaign (in addition to Education, Transportation and Gerrymandering.) Premiums can be as expensive as a house payment now, and health insurance is moving out of the range of affordability for many people. To make health insurance more competitive and keep premiums down, I would encourage new policies that promote competition among states so that Marylanders have better options. My experience as a senior benefits analyst will help me work with health experts and leaders in this area. Removing unnecessary regulations can help, as well as finding ways to incentivize companies to encourage healthy preventive practices.","I applaud what Governor Hogan has been doing to combat crime in Baltimore. To combat crime at the state level, we need supports for our police to do their job while doing what is necessary to rid corruption from the police force. Stricter sentences for repeat offenders with gun crimes is another action that can be taken. Incarcerating repeat offenders who have violated parole is another action. .Working with the Department of Housing and Community Development to fast-track the removal of crime infested old buildings will help. And, to break the cycle of poverty and crime as a long term solution, I'm very interested in promoting programs to help mothers when they give birth, to provide immediate supports in parenthood education.","From the perspective as resident of Montgomery County, I would say the business climate has much room for improvement because many strategies that are done to improve business growth in our state are thwarted in my county by the all-Democrat county delegation. For example, we still have a rain tax in Montgomery County. To foster jobs and support families, our state needs to remove many of the stifling regulations. I have noticed that Lt. Governor Boyd Rutherford is making progress on this already. To attract great companies with good benefits, our state needs to support transportation projects such as the CCT project in Montgomery County which will encourage more growth of the Bio Health Capital Region. Our state needs to continue to financially support education (and work to make sure the dollars are spent effectively) as well because a state with a lackluster education system will not attract new companies.","It is time our elected officials do something about our unfair gerrymandering in our state! Even former Governor O'Malley acknowledges that changes need to be made to give our voters fair representation. Governor Hogan has offered fair solutions with proposed bills every year, but politics are getting in the way of moving forward on this very important issue. A bill was introduced this year and sat on the shelf after the first hearing. This is extremely frustrating! I hope the Supreme Court sheds light on the gerrymandering issue by this summer since the Maryland case was heard this April. I would approve a bill, like the one Governor Hogan put forth this year, to establish a committee of nine commissioners where no one political party is over represented. This committee would determine boundaries in a fair manner to include public hearings and transparency of redistricting data. I hope voters will hold all those running for office accountable, to promise to support such a bill in 2019. This should be a no brainer issue for Republicans and Democrats and if elected, I will certainly make this a top priority in my first session","By answer on this is ""I don't know."" I would need to talk to policemen and community stakeholders before taking a position on this issue. But, I will say that it is important for our police to feel supported by our community. They are given special powers as law enforcers and they risk their lives. I want to be sure they are protected and supported. I want to know that police are well trained and vetted. I have been a strong advocate of School Resource Officers for our public schools and was lucky to ride with a police officer one evening and spend a morning with an SRO where we visited three schools. This has helped me gain a perspective of these special people who serve in our state.","The opioid crisis is very real and very little was done about it in this 2018 legislative session. The number of deaths from opioid/ alcohol addiction went from 1,259 to 2,089 in 2016 and the worst problem is in Baltimore City. When people become addicted to opioids, it is an enormous feat to combat the addiction. Prevention is critical, for the state to coordinate efforts with districts to provide education programs so the public is aware of the potential dangers when they are prescribed an opiate for medical reasons. Behaviors of our medical profession need to change, so that opioids are not a ""go to"" drug when tylenol or other less addictive alternative might be almost as good. And, because so many are addicted today, we need to establish affordable evidence-based rehabilitation programs in our communities to help the suffering beat their addiction.","The best way to address income inequality is with education. A strong k-12, college and vocational system in Maryland will prepare people for a successful life and well paying job. The mindset that college is the best way to go for all students must change by promoting vocational training in high school and outside of high school so the trades are recognized as excellent pathways. The state can foster communications between companies and our school systems to open up apprenticeship opportunities for our young people. Public/ private partnerships are important so our schools can prepare students when they enter the working world.",I recently took a two hour online training course on the Open Meetings Act as a Member of the Montgomery Board of License Commissioners. I do believe the Open Meetings Act helps to ensure that conversations among board members on issues take place in public. It is very important for me that government is transparent because those in government work for the people and they deserve open access to information.

The devil is in the detail, with cost being paramount in the evaluation of the options. Exploration of business partnerships would be one means of advancing technology in education in a time when taxation is driving employment to other states.","The Baltimore region is not adequately served by transit and the State does not have the resources to meet all unmet needs. As long as the goal is to provide door-to-door service to all, there can never be the expectation that the needs can be met. More focus should be on providing reliable and timely transit on main routes into and out of Baltimore, and then focus on individual service in local communities.",No,"Local governments must be encouraged, or even required, to consider more detailed impact assessments of new development with the goal of fully addressing the negative environmental effects.","Strengthen families and assure living wages for working individuals. Employers should be encouraged to provide basic health care for all employees. Medicaid service will be needed for families with low incomes, but the long term goal will be to have enough workers in the family to purchase basic health care.","A generational focus on rebuilding stable family structures must be initiated. It will be challenging to undo the deterioration of the family over the past decades, but good living wage jobs along with educational efforts will be essential.","Maryland's reliance on government jobs is problematic. Down turns in the size of the federal work force could be a major loss to the Maryland tax base. Businesses look at the overall tax burden, not only for the corporate entity, but also the workers. Consideration of reductions in all taxes must be part of the process of getting businesses to stay and grow in Maryland.",I would go as far as to turn the process over to computer algorithms that would look simply at the number of people in each district without consideration of any other factors except for County boundaries.,"I would be open to any constructive suggestions, but would be comfortable with the current situation.","A stronger focus on the reduction in the number and quantity of medical prescriptions would be the first step. Foreign importation, legal and illegal, would be the second focal point. Strengthening family values would be my focus in all issues, and in regard to illegal drugs, would only help.","Income inequality should be the driving force to individuals to excel and escape from poverty. Living wage jobs would be the goal for all people, but incentives for advancing economic status should allow all to expand their personal wealth. Government may be called upon to provide a floor to insure that everyone has the basics for ""reasonable"" living, but removing the incentive to advance is not in the best interest of society.","No. Continued improvement in the electronic access to meeting schedules and meeting content is needed. Governmental agencies tend to obscure meeting notices with advance notices of less than adequate for community organizations to be informed and discuss the issues. Most community groups meet no more frequently than monthly and do not have the time to meet, discuss, and vote on positions when the public notice is no more than 3 or 4 weeks.

Most recently, I served as the Chief of Staff to a State Senator.","Fundamentally, I agree with the 9 Building Blocks outlined for success in the Kirwin Commission, and I agree that the issues discovered when comparing our state's education system to those of other countries must be addressed. Specifically, teacher recruitment, equal access to pre-k for families of all income levels, and a better system of introducing technology into our schools are needed. I look forward to reading the Commission's report when it gets published later this year. As the numbers are preliminary, any commitment I could make to funding these reforms would be premature. I am encouraged by the high ROI cited by funding pre-k, and will look to further analysis to contribute input as we move closer to making this a reality for our children.","Safe roads are essential. Ongoing reassessment of traffic patterns, especially as new mapping software on cell phones takes people through residential neighborhoods that previously had lower volumes of traffic, is necessary. A good transit system has to balance the needs of neighborhoods and residents with cost and expected ROI. The state can maintain its transportation needs with available resources by keeping contracts for repairs and construction with in-state companies and not offering contracts to companies who do not meet deadlines on road construction.","Yes. Research shows that it can assist in stemming the opioid epidemic. It is common sense that disenfranchising illegal cartels will serve the residents of Maryland by keeping harder drugs that come through these illegal pipelines out of our state. I also think from a fiscal standpoint we can benefit from the tax income. I will support this measure when we have the proper information to circumvent the potential increase in traffic incidents, like have occurred in Colorado and Washington, to ensure road safety for citizens. Safety is my biggest concern with the legalization of recreational marijuana. We will need similar laws and enforcement to those of alcohol which would aim to keep public property and family friendly areas drug-free.","I support adding an educational element to the curriculum to address environmental science and the importance of recycling and disposing of waste appropriately. Many of our stormwater drains go to the Chesapeake Bay, and encouraging proper disposal of waste will help reduce harmful substances draining into our Bay.","Affordable healthcare will be difficult to achieve without the one thing drives costs down in all areas - competition. This is achievable by the free market system. Increasing competition among health care companies in Maryland will provide more affordable options to all residents. Different companies will have different requirements for membership, which makes more sense than applying a one-size-fits-all approach to health care, as everyone's health needs are drastically different.","The role the state can play in helping Baltimore address violent crime is to work with the communities to set up programs to encourage people from those communities to be community leaders in a positive way. These programs would train youth from these communities to be police officers, firefighters, and teachers. Giving back to these communities in positive ways would not only give more appreciation for the duties of these public servants, but motivate young people about their futures.","Upon speaking with business owners in the communities throughout my district, the consensus is that taxes are too high and there's too much paperwork. The annual filing fee is expensive and it is in addition to what is paid in taxes. In order to foster the creation of more family-supporting jobs, we need to scale back regulations and lower taxes and fees.",Absolutely.,"The LEOBR serves its purpose of protecting police and the public. This does not mean we do not need police reform. I respect the police: their jobs entail long hours and occasionally dangerous situations, and quick judgment calls. It is an often thankless job with an incredible responsibility of keeping citizens safe. There need to be checkpoints throughout years of service to ensure that the high stress lifestyle of these individuals has not created any mental health issues or biases based on past work. Such checkups are not currently required on the force without a reason for referral.","The opioid crisis is terribly upsetting, and something that affects me personally. A close friend passed away in 2016 from an overdose. I want to work with our knowledge and resources to fight this crisis and help stem addiction. We need more treatment facilities that are available to low-income individuals. There are a few great treatment centers, that have a great outcome but come at a high cost. We also need to work with the medical community to stop the overprescribing of painkillers. There needs to be a balance; too low of a dose or a supply, and certain conditions become intolerable; too high, and the risk of addiction rises. While several bills have passed the General Assembly to address this issue, it still occurs. There needs to be a system of safe disposal for prescription painkillers so that when an individual no longer needs to take pain pills and has some left over, there is no risk of guests or family members having access to these pills.",The state must continue to enforce its anti-discrimination laws to prevent illegal wage disparities.,"The state's Public Information Act and open meetings laws are small steps towards ensuring oversight of our government. They don't go far enough to address transparency and accountability issues in our state. We need better notice of public meetings where stakeholders can be present, and for meetings to be held in accessible areas as best as possible. There needs to be Inspector Generals appointed to work with counties and state budgets, for accountability with our tax dollars and to guarantee correct appropriation of funds. I support video streaming of our legislative sessions in the General Assembly. These are just a few of the examples of areas where we can improve our oversight of government.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

I broadly support these goals, and I am looking forward to the findings in the final report.","Maryland's transportation spending is not appropriately balanced between roads and transit, but also not balanced between geographic regions. The current administration has invested in DC suburbs to develop the Purple Line, the Inter County Connector, and other projects. Meanwhile, Baltimore City and Baltimore County have been chronically underfunded. Baltimore Link reorganized routes but did not add new capacity to meet our growing transportation needs. Investing in transportation creates more jobs and attracts investment, both of which are badly needed in Baltimore region.",I do not support legalization of recreational marijuana at this time because of the disconnect it would create between Federal and State law. The Federal government is a major employer in our state. Legalization would prevent many Maryland jobseekers from qualifying for some high-paying federal jobs that penalize applicants who test positive for marijuana.,"Our first priority should be to enforce existing environmental laws and following through on measures already enacted, such as planting grass and trees along the Chesapeake Bay to act as a riparian barrier to prevent soil erosion. We also need to address wastewater runoff particularly from Baltimore City and County, which is the leading contributor of nitrogen and phosphorus pollution from the State of Maryland.","I believe that healthcare is a human right, and it should be accessible and affordable for all. No one should ever go bankrupt trying to obtain decent healthcare. We should at the very minimum protect all-payer status of Maryland. I also support the plan for the formation of a task force to explore enacting single payer healthcare in the State of Maryland. Finally, the introduction of a public option in our health care exchanges is a viable first step in ensuring that all Marylanders have access to quality healthcare.",The state should set the tone of striking the right balance between keeping violent offenders off the streets while embracing rehabilitation of people who have paid their dues to society.,"The state of Maryland traditionally goes out of its way to be welcoming to major corporations. Maryland should also welcome and nurture small businesses, which are the engines of economic growth in our state. Through its several agencies regulating business and commerce, the state should encourage public-private partnerships to come up with new and innovative ideas leading to further economic growth.","We need to take the politics out of redistricting. I fully support an independent, nonpartisan commission for districting.",I support a periodic review of the Police Officer's Bill of Rights dependent on circumstances that might arise from citizen and peace officer's concerns.,"Dr. Richard Bruno recently put forward a comprehensive three-pronged approach to tackle opioid crisis in an op-ed in Baltimore Sun. The steps include integrating prescription drug monitoring databases into electronic health records to prevent multiple prescriptions, providing assistance to medication-assisted treatment, and investing in expanded access to the antidote naloxone. I whole-heartedly support this plan.","Poverty and income inequality are complex subjects, and we need a multi-pronged approach. We need to strengthen public education and invest in non-traditional courses that provide much needed skills to get good-paying jobs. We need to invest in transportation that takes people to jobs. Furthermore, we need to invest in retraining of workers so that they can find re-employment in a rapidly changing economy. We also need to nurture small businesses that will help address the gap between the living wage and the minimum wage.","The statutes of the Maryland Public Information Acts allows citizens to attend public meetings, gives the public adequate notice of these meetings, and allows citizens to inspect the minutes of these meetings. There is room to expand the ability of citizens to participate and exercise oversight. I fully support the open meetings compliance board which issues opinions in response to written complaints in response to violations of this act.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

I graduated from Northwestern University with a BA in political science.","Delegate Shelly Hettleman was elected in 2014 to represent the 11th district of Baltimore County in the Maryland General Assembly where she serves on the Appropriations Committee, the Joint Audit Committee, and the Joint Committee to End Homelessness. Prior to serving in the House of Delegates, Shelly was the Campaign Manager of the 2012 Ben Cardin for Senate campaign that resulted in Sen. Cardin's resounding re-election. She also co-led the Maryland Democratic Party Coordinated Campaign that was responsible for the re-election of the Maryland Democratic congressional delegation. In prior positions, Shelly was the founding director of the domestic violence program, CHANA, worked in financial resource development at The Associated: Jewish Community Federation of Baltimore, was the Project Director for the Jewish Women's Archive oral history project Weaving Women's Words: Baltimore Stories, was the Director of Government Relations for the non-profit advocacy organization, Parent Action, as well as for the Baltimore Jewish Council. Shelly began her professional career serving as a Legislative Assistant in the office of then-Congressman Cardin and on the staff of Sen. Barbara Mikulski's first campaign for U.S. Senate.","I strongly support the preliminary recommendations of the Commission. Maryland now falls far short of its duty and potential to achieve high levels of student performance and to provide the necessary adequate funding. That can and must change. The Commission is laying out a clear and promising path to educational excellence for all schoolchildren. Reforms must be based on high standards, adequate resources, and strict accountability for how well the funds are spent. The state department of education must play a stronger role, particularly in requiring the statewide use of evidence-based best instructional practices within a balanced framework that allows local school systems to retain considerable flexibility. Critical priority program areas are: teacher recruitment and retention; early childhood programs including wraparound family services; targeted assistance for at-risk students including students with disabilities and limited English proficiency; and career and technology education. Formula aid must consider regional cost adjustments. The projected cost of around $2b/year will require incremental increases in revenue over a many years, even after some program savings, such as reducing referrals to special education through early interventions. Revenue for the prior ""Thornton program"" was phased in over multi-years. The phase-in might prioritize funds to improve reading in grades pre-k through 5th grade. State and local fiscal responsibility must be based on local wealth and income, taking into account concentrations of poverty. We must not relax high standards nor shortchange the neediest students. We know the way to educational excellence for all and now must show the will.","Maryland's spending and commitment towards upgrading our public transportation infrastructure is nowhere near what is should be, and the financial commitment to roads far surpasses our commitment to public transit. While we cannot in anyway abandon road maintenance and construction, we need to do a better job fixing our public transit. The Central Maryland Transportation Alliance recently rated the region's transit a D, which is unacceptable. A poor transportation system puts us at a major economic disadvantage, and makes it impossible for so many Marylanders to get to work each day and access vital services. The Red Line was a major first step towards finally building a world- class transportation system in Baltimore, and with its cancellation we are left with a shell of what is needed with the BaltimoreLink, which is only a continuation of the same inadequate bus system that preceded it. I was happy to support additional operating and capital funding for the Maryland Transit Administration (MTA) in HB 372, a bill mainly focused on creating a dedicated funding source for the Washington Area Metro Transportation Authority (WMATA). The legislation also requires MTA to develop, with stakeholder input, a capital needs assessment as well as a transit plan for the central Maryland area.","I am open to the possibility of legalizing marijuana. I supported the legalization of medical marijuana and do generally support the decriminalization of marijuana. We know that rates of arrest for possession are racially skewed: African Americans, who are 30% of the state's population, account for 58% of such arrests. In addition, further enforcement of marijuana laws is very expensive and diverts police from more serious crimes. However, I do have concerns about legalization. There is much we do not yet know about the long term effects of marijuana use, particularly with respect to usage by youths and young adults. I would support moving forward with legalization with caution. If we do legalize marijuana, we should limit usage to adults, carefully monitor the consequences (intended and unintended), be open to modifications over time to assure that we address negative consquences, and impose significant taxes on the sale of marijuana (to create disincentives for use and to raise revenue for oversight, education, etc.).","A clean Chesapeake Bay is incredibly important to Maryland's economy. With 18 million people residing in six states and D.C. living along the largest estuary in the country, we need to be sure that the waste and pollution generated by the residents of the Bay's border states has as minimal an impact as possible on the Bay. There has been much progress in cleaning up the Bay through the Total Daily Maximum Load (TMDL) program, ensuring that harmful runoff is limited by capping the amounts of pesticides and other harmful materials that can be used in a given day. I am a strong supporter of the state continuing to ensure that the TMDL program is strictly monitored. We also need to be sure that nitrogen, phosphorus and other pollutants are reduced so that sunlight is able to reach the important undergrass, so essential to a clean Bay ecosystem. I support the Wastewater Treatment Plant Fund as well as the storm water management program so important to effectively managing runoff. Annually, this program generates over $100 million dollars for the Bay Restoration Fund. Individuals can also have an enormous impact on the health of the Bay. How we care for our homes, yards, roads, and the foods we eat are just a few of the ways that individuals can reduce our negative impact on the Bay.","The Affordable Care Act made tremendous strides towards ensuring that those who were not covered by health insurance obtained access to coverage. The rate of the uninsured in Maryland has dropped from 14% in 2010 to 6% this year and Maryland ranks high among states in new enrollees and the numbers of young people signing up for coverage. We also have among the lowest number of uninsured. However, the Trump Administration has done its best to roll back this expansion by removing the individual mandate, causing uncertainty in the insurance market, which has resulted in a rise in the cost of healthcare. In an effort to provide a short-term fix and a longer-term solution to this rise in healthcare cost, which is fundamental to blocking access to healthcare, I was pleased to support both HB 1795 and HB 1782. These bills will enable Maryland to seek a federal waiver and use this flexibility to collect fees that the insurance companies have been paying, but were waived this year under federal tax reform, to pay for state-run reinsurance program. The legislation will also require a study to address the longer term issues around stabilizing the market. The state also needs to take an active role in regulating the pharmaceutical industry, especially in light of the federal government's unwillingness to. I supported legislation in 2017 that enables the Attorney General to prevent prescription drug price gouging of off-patent drugs and requires pharmaceutical companies to justify price increases.","The state should play a significant role in curbing violent crime in Maryland. This session we passed funding initiatives to prevent violent crime. I supported the Violence Intervention & Prevention Program funding evidence-based programs that prevent gun violence. I also supported expanding Safe Streets, a program that has been very effective at using formerly incarcerated individuals to prevent violence in high-crime neighborhoods. Individuals who have been involved in the criminal justice system should have opportunities once they return to the community. I supported the Second Chance Act, shielding certain crimes from employers as well as ""Ban the Box"" legislation that prevents colleges and universities from denying admission to applicants based on whether they had a criminal record. I was one of the legislators who wrote to the Attorney General inquiring about the constitutionality of our bail system. Now, individuals who pose the most dangerous threat to the community are jailed. Finally, we are moving away from a system where people were imprisoned because they could not afford to pay bail. I advocated within the Appropriations Committee for $1 million in the budget to fund expanded pre-trial services so that they are comprehensive enough to link participants with services to support a transition away from criminal activity towards productive community activity and employment. HB 447 will guide how those funds will be distributed. The best crime program is one that prevents crime. Strengthening our educational system will provide students with the skills they need to get jobs in our changing economy.","We need to recognize that the economy is changing and that jobs in manufacturing that were once dominant in Baltimore are no longer viable. The healthcare, technology and cybersecurity sectors are ripe for expansion and would build upon our already existing strengths. We should train students before they graduate from high schools. I'm very interested in knowing whether the P-Tech schools launched between high school and industry will be an effective means of supporting growth in these industries. Local community colleges should work closely with industry to craft clear career pathways that will be responsive to the labor needs of local business. One of the major hindrances in Baltimore is the lack of reliable public transportation for people to get to work. Companies will locate in places with comprehensive transportation systems. We also need to be responsive to workers' needs. Low income workers' wages have not risen as quickly as those on the higher income workers. In order to make sure that every working Marylander is valued, we should phase in an increase in the minimum wage to $15 per hour, a bill I sponsored this session. Businesses would have a chance to plan and by indexing the wage to inflation, they would have predictability, something they've argued is paramount to their planning. I also support policies that would make work-life balance better for workers with children, such as a state insurance plan that would support a paid family leave policy.","I conditionally support the creation of such a body for the stated purpose. Our democracy is rooted in principles of representation of and accountability to all of our constituents. Extreme partisan gerrymandering threatens these principles, lessens the consequences of failure to listen to broad perspectives and compromise in adopting policy and undermines confidence in government. I support efforts to make the redistricting process fairer and more transparent. For state legislative offices, I support a nonpartisan commission to make recommendations on redistricting. With respect to Congressional districts, I am concerned about the impacts on Maryland if we modified our districts while other states (particular those closest to us geographically) did not. I believe that any similar effort to redraw Congressional lines should be part of a consolidated, simultaneous effort to redraw lines in ""red"" and ""blue"" states; neither Democrats nor Republicans should have an advantage nationally because some states follow a nonpartisan process and other don't. Therefore, while I would support the goal of a nonpartisan commission to make recommendations on Congressional redistricting in Maryland, I would only support making this change if a sufficient number of other states were doing the same.","We are deeply indebted to the police officers, and all first responders across the state that sacrifice so much for our safety. We must ensure that both they and the citizens that they protect feel valued. The Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights may need changing in order to provide more accountability and responsiveness to public mistrust. Recent crises have contributed to the growing community mistrust of the police that must be addressed. Certainly, the abuses of the Gun Trace Task Force has contributed to the cynicism that public has about the police. I believe the vast majority of police are honest, hardworking individuals who are dedicated to public service, but it is quite concerning that the GTTF lasted for as long as it did and I'm concerned there may be a culture that somehow condoned its operation. I was happy to support legislation this session creating a commission to examine these abuses and make recommendations for policy improvements. Additionally we need to do a better job at improving police community relations, by having more community focused policing strategies. Programs like the Citizens Police Academy need to be expanded statewide, and other opportunities for the public, especially students, to get involved with the police department should be made available.","In order to start to solve the opioid crisis we need to have a dramatic change in the way physicians, of all specialties, treat pain. I support limiting physicians' ability to prescribe opiates and we must continue to hold them accountable through the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program. Limiting dosages is only one aspect. We need to take a serious look at which doctors are permitted to prescribe opioids, and in what circumstances they should be allowed to do so. While this issue is finally receiving the public attention it so desperately needed, we also need to raise the awareness of how people can become addicted and what we all can do to address the issue. I was pleased to support bringing education about opioid addiction into schools as well as to fund more treatment programs. Learning from a young age how destructive these drugs are can have a significant curbing effect on use of opioids in the first place. But the focus also has to be on treatment, and the availability of treatment, as well as insurance coverage for it, and providing it on demand for those who truly need it. Addiction is a disease and we need to be sure that insurance coverage recognizes that quick fixes and short-term treatments are largely unsuccessful. I am also in favor of exploring alternative treatments that are being used in other countries, including the use of Ibogaine that is having some success in Mexico and other countries.","Addressing income inequality requires urgent action. We must uncover and understand the roots of the inequality, among them racial and gender discrimination. And over the past four years, it has been a constant priority of my legislative work and I've worked closely with Associated Black Charities to understand making policy through a racial equity lens. I believe in a progressive income tax and believe that we should be regularly reviewing the tax credit system we've developed to provide incentives to larger corporations. These are potential losses in taxes that may be better spent providing relief to lower middle class workers. I was happy to support an increase in the minimum wage, an expansion of the childcare voucher system, paid sick leave, and an expansion of the Earned Income Tax Credit as methods of addressing income inequality. Just yesterday, a front page story in The Sun reported on a study showing that women in Maryland were paid 84 cents for every dollar paid to men. And the gap is increasing. I support legislation to address pay equity, but the long quest to reduce income inequality also involves other priority steps like growing businesses and good jobs. No less important is improving public education so Maryland can offer a skilled workforce of good-paying jobs that would help attract businesses. The recommendations of the Kirwan Commission call for a complete, bold overhaul of career and technology education that elevate the content and image of career readiness programs and move Maryland to the top.","I was pleased to support improvements to the Public Information Act in 2015, but there is still room for expanded public access to information. I support a presumption that the public should have access unless there is a good reason to keep the information confidentiality. There are still many issues where it is too easy for a Public Information Officer to deny access to the media. For example, it is still inconsistent when the public has access to body camera footage and under what circumstances a denial is appropriate. While this is still new technology, policies need to keep up with technological advances. When PIO's deny access they should have to provide a reason for why they are denying rather than redacting, a change which I support. A flat denial may be easier for the institution, but it denies the public the right to know. There should be regular Ombudsman reviews to ensure that our policies are keeping up with the public's need and right to know.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education? Are you committed to funding associated reforms, and if so, how?","Is Maryland’s transportation spending appropriately balanced between roads and transit? Does the state have the resources to meet its transportation needs?

Clearly articulated findings and recommendations will help build the political will for needed investments and implementation to ensure a world-class public education system that supports all students. As a State Delegate, I have supported investment in programs including; universal pre-k, trade and technical training, p-tech and other challenging and accelerated curricula, and additional funding and resources for schools serving students facing barriers to education such as poverty, disability or language. The Commission shed new light on the critical importance of identifying, hiring and retaining good teachers, assuring diversity in administrative and teaching staff and providing compensation and incentives commensurate with the importance and demands of teaching. Additionally, the Community Schools Initiative and legislation that I have championed recognizes the importance of behavioral health and support in schools at all levels. I will support new legislation based on the recommendations of the Commission and look forward to reviewing and moving forward on their funding formulas and implementation.","Cancelling the Red Line without offering a comprehensive alternative set the efforts to address transportation needs, and particularly those of the Baltimore metropolitan area, back decades. In and of themselves the Baltimore Link, additional lanes on the beltway and parkway, ride-sharing and autonomous vehicles are not the solution. Investment in affordable, reliable mass transit – maintenance and expansion – is critical and the decision of this administration to reverse direction was shortsighted and ill advised from job, work force, economic, ecologic and social justice standpoints. Lowering tolls on public byways, while politically popular, undermines our ability to adequately fund our transportation needs, particularly as increased fuel efficiency and resistance to higher levies steadily decreases gas tax revenues. Plans for public –private road and bridge projects mean higher cost to the public, as tolls levied privately tend to include profit margins that would not be part of tolls levied by the state. The MAG-lev promises to speed transit between the Baltimore – Washington hubs already served by AMTRAK, MARC, etc. People outside of the ""hubs"" will still need cars to reach the stations, communities through which its infrastructure will be built will be impacted, and the Washington-to-Boston commuters, for which this link is the 1st stage of a new corridor-long line, are the primary beneficiaries. It does not mitigate the failings of the state transportation system. Transportation needs outside of the metro areas are also inadequately addressed, particularly the transportation needs of our aging population.","Although I fully support the legalization of medical cannabis in the state, I do not currently support legalization of recreational marijuana. I believe we would benefit from more experience with our medical cannabis industry, the experiences of other states that have legalized recreational use and from having better technology and science for determining and measuring levels which would constitute impaired use.","Our work in the General Assembly and years of hard work has improved the health of the Chesapeake Bay, which is now the healthiest it has been in decades. We need to continue to use every tool at our disposal including lawsuits against the EPA and other federal entities, collaborative agreements with other states who are part of the Bay's watershed, and supportive legislative and regulatory measures. We need to continue to review and assure that the use of potentially toxic herbicides, pesticides and other chemicals (similar to the Atrazine legislation I introduced in 2017) are updated. I am committed to implement provisions of the international climate change pact, to ensure enforcement of environmental regulations and to mitigate against all toxic runoff from rain, industrial and agricultural sources. I support enlarging and preserving oyster sanctuaries. I am committed to limiting and not disallowing further piping of natural gas and oil through environmentally sensitive waterways.","Access to health care is a right. As a delegate, I've worked to ensure improved access and quality are realized statewide and that the decrease number of uninsured and other benefits resulting from the ACA translate to improved health status. Congress' failure to go further and bring down health care delivery costs, and the efforts of this congress and administration to dismantle the system, required an aggressive response from Annapolis, and I am proud to be have played a role. Requesting a federal 1332 waiver and providing funding for re-insurance were important, but stop-gap, until a comprehensive, long term solution is found. My work on the ACA workgroup, familiarity with the opioid crisis and other addiction and behavioral health problems, efforts to bring transparency to the pharmaceutical pricing, and recognition of the nexus between health care and our economic, environmental, criminal and social justice challenges have affirmed my belief that a radical change is needed. My contribution to the discussion as a physician and patient advocate has been, and will continue to be, important. I've conceptually supported single-payer, universal healthcare for years, believing it could only happen if the people, and not the government, called for it. We're now in that moment. Along with other suggestions, legislation seemingly offering a clear pathway to transitioning was introduced in 2018 and will be considered in preparation for next session. Additional pieces, like negotiated drug prices and catastrophic coverage, may need to be added, but I believe Maryland will make the move.","Support Baltimore City's implementation of violence reduction measures. Fund community initiatives including programs such as Safe Streets. Fund and provide proper education infrastructure and tools. Reform the police department and create trust. Offer viable alternatives to criminal activity by comprehensively addressing the multiple challenges and inadequacies with respect to housing, jobs, transportation and opportunity. Engage citizens in crafting solutions. Continue the path of criminal justice reform that diminishes or even negates the negative impact that a corrupt system has had on the family and communities. Consider legalizing and regulating drugs to bring the trade it out of the underground and create legal methods of settling business disputes. Persists. Many, if not most of the solutions have been tried in some form or another before. What is needed is a long term commitment of dollars and effort, since we cannot expect to reverse generations of oppression and marginalization, miseducation and broken trust in 3 - 10 years.","Maryland's business climate is supportive of large corporations, particularly with a national or international presence, and inadequately supports start-up, small and medium sized businesses. This is because short-term benefits are easier to perceive, promote and build support around than are long-term gains. The system favors attracting new businesses over growing businesses and does so too often with ""investments"" that are not adequately evaluated against cost or alternative. This is unfortunate since it has clearly been shown that the net benefits, of investing in the development, growth and expansion of Maryland- and locally-based business far outweigh those of inducing outside businesses to come to the state. This is not an either/or proposition; we need a healthy mix and presence of businesses throughout the state across multiple industries and at all levels from production of raw materials, through manufacturing and sales. The General Assembly has started to implement the recommendations of the Augustine Commission. We should also take a broad range of factors into consideration and, in addition to how we traditionally weigh business and economic decisions, view them through an equity lens.","I support, and, as a delegate, have introduced legislation during the last three sessions in support of the creation of a non-partisan, independent body to draw legislative and congressional district maps. I understand that the timing and way in which we move towards such a system has implications at the national level. At this point it is prudent to see how the Supreme Court rules on the issues of gerrymandering and how prescriptive they may or may not be in their decision and possible recommendations of constitutionally acceptable solutions","While the Law Enforcement Bill of Rights was drafted to provide due process to law enforcement officers who were under internal investigation and procedural and disciplinary standings when the investigation turn up wrong doing. Although a national model when passed in 1974, some of the protections granted have proven to be problematic when considered in the context of a citizens rights and the rights of the citizenry to hold the police department and its employees accountable in carrying out the duties to protect and serve. Recommendations for reform have been argued and some changes made, but additional reforms should be considered. A formal review process, beyond the debates and negotiations seen when legislation about reforms are heard before committee, should be undertaken. Among other things the study should include comparisons with similar statutes in other states and for other government employees groups in Maryland. The report generated should outline which of the provision specifically address due process rights, which offer protections outside of those rights, how the rights granted differ from those in force elsewhere, how they impact other imperatives of the force and specific recommendations for updating them, giving due consideration to how policing and mechanisms for ensuring adequate training and compliance with departmental rules have changed since the Bill of Rights was written.","In addition to the steps we've already taken to better educate opioid prescribers, dispensers, users, first responders and the general public as to the nature and extent of the problem, we've also increased available interventions and began to address the problem as a behavioral health problem. Additionally, we should 1) direct more resources to identifying and addressing the underlying behavioral, social, psychological and other circumstances that lead to use and abuse of these and other addictive mood altering agents; 2) increase the number treatment beds and range of facilities available - including requiring hospitals to take more responsibility for providing acute, intermediate and long term treatment inpatient and outpatient treatment offerings; 3)push our federal partners to move Ibogaine and marijuana from schedule 1 to schedule 2 so that adequate research can be done to determine what, if any role they may each have in treating addiction for Ibogaine, and pain for marijuana; 4) improve tools for identifying and taking down major suppliers; and 5) consider whether decrimnalization or legalization of all drugs, with regulation and oversight , is part of the solution.","Income inequality is so intricately sewn into our societal and economic fabric that a multipronged, intentional, global approach is needed at the federal, staet and local levels, to extricate it. A livable wage indexed to inflation is part of the solution, but needs to be implemented with effort made to mitigate against unintended consequences , and does not on its on address the problem of individuals being held to the same salary or wage for years. Undoing the impact of redlining and other institutionalized practices of race and class discriminatory practices through enforcement of antidiscrimination laws and regulations in housing and lending, eliminating preditory lending practices, opening opportunities for microlending, innovation incubators and intentionally looking to correct in areas of past discrimantion for the damage cause by those practices. Of course radically changing our approach to education to ensure that a good quality, free, education through associates degree or trade certification is provided is key.","Having recieved a ""D"" in the 2015 report by the Stae Integrity Project, a number of changes have been made in the in the way Maryland addresses transparency, but as the issue continued to play out in the 2018 legislative session, the problem has clearly not been adequately addressed. The creation of the public information compliance board and ombudsman at the Attorney General's office are too new to determine their effectiveness or whther their roles shold be broadened. The technologyallowing for live streaming of public meetings should be uniformly available and consistantly used, and agency web sites which often fail to have basic information readily accesable should do so.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

Prior to law school, staff aide and membership coordinator.","I do support, at least in large part, the findings of the commission. I am committed to funding the associated reforms, as I believe is also our duty in the Maryland Declaration of Rights. Maryland got to be an attractive place to live in large part due to the educational system it had. We need to be able to adapt to change, and adequately funding these projects, like universal pre-k, are a priority for me.","No. Roads are expensive and inefficient, and we have not done a good job of having a diversified transportation network. Baltimore, in particular, has not been adequately served by transit. Car congestion on our highways has resembled parking lots, and we lose minutes and hours every year to commutes that could otherwise be spent with friends , family, and leisure activities. I believe that we can more effectively spend the existing transportation budget, and if additional projects become necessary, there are models we can adopt to accurately reflect the true costs of the type of transportation that need to be built. A bus that runs on the ICC should not cost a user more than it does for each individual car to drive on it. That is a prime example of financial and environmental resources.","Yes, I support the legalization, regulation, and taxation of recreational marijuana. The war on drugs is a costly and abject failure. I think other states have already shown the proceeds can be directed towards education systems and I would like to see public health funded more adequately as well. I believe the legalization of marijuana can be a part of that path.","Marylanders understand how important the environment across the state is, and in particular the Chesapeake Bay. We need to be sure to protect our environment whether or not we have the support of the Federal Government. Regrettably, in this administration, it does not look like we have a partner who shares our goals. Therefore, we should be adequately supporting our attorney general to make environmental claims that violate our laws. We also need to be sure to have legislation that protects our most precious environmental resources including, but not limited to, incentives for clean, renewable energy.","My preference would be a system that reflects most other western countries with a single payer system. While no system is perfect, the United States lags behind other countries in positive health outcomes while spending the same amounts or more money. I think health care should be a right, and that it is vital to our citizens at a time where our economy has shifted to be more dynamic and fast paced than it has been. The days of working for a single employer are becoming more the exception, and not the rule. Therefore, the system of health care that may have once been acceptable, no longer works the way it should.","The state should be a partner in helping Baltimore address issues ranging from poverty to substance abuse to adequate facilities for children to learn. A true partnership is not the state directing and dictating, nor is it a blank check. I also think we should think of bold and innovative solutions, and not the solutions that have been tried in the past to limited or unsustainable success.","Maryland is probably no better than middle of the pack when comparing states and the business climate. Maryland offers - overall - a good educational system and sits in a wonderful location, in the midst of the East Coast, There are certainly other attractive features, in my view. However, I think Maryland, like other states are too quick to cater to large corporations at the expense of smaller or main street businesses. The focus should be on whether or not the state is putting all its businesses in a position to succeed, not just trying to compete against multiple other jurisdictions to lure the next corporation. I favor investing in the building blocks of an educated and/or well trained workforce, accessible and reliable transit options, and a clean, safe environment to live. I would much rather Maryland be the creator of the next great business or businesses, because that is more sustainable to a vibrant economy.","Absolutely, yes. Legislators have many serious issues to get to in a 90 day session. Working on how to insulate incumbents and political parties by essentially picking constituents is not a democratic process in my view. We should be focused on the people's business, not how to get rehired automatically every 4 years regardless of our performance. It is time for Maryland to do what is right, and not operate under the false premise that because other states draw lines on a hyper-partisan basis we should too. Two wrongs does not make a right. It is that simple.","It should be changed. There are numerous issues I have with the LEO Bill of Rights. From the time limitations placed on a person who wishes to make a brutality claim being too short, to the section dealing with polygraph tests, something that is junk science, of the officers are just some of the reasons I would want to make revisions to the Bill of Rights. First, the time limitation is awfully short for a person to bring a claim. Unfortunately, we have seen with the Gun Trace Task Force some extraordinarily brutal officers intimidate numerous people. It is totally conceivable that a person would be too terrified to raise a claim within 90 days.","We should continue to approach the opioid addiction and overdose crisis through a primarily public health approach. As an attorney, I think drug courts are beneficial, and can also play a role. I also think we need to investigate exactly how we got here, and if drug companies and doctors were too quick to write pain medications that can often lead to opioid addiction, we may need to insist on training existing doctors and the next generation of doctors how to more effectively deal with pain treatment. I think we should also be willing to have our Attorney General be supported in cases where it is necessary to bring doctors or drug companies to court if they knew of the aspects of the danger, and continued to recklessly unleash a massive societal and public health problem.","I think the state should address income inequality, and I think some of it can be done in a manner that does benefit all citizens. I favor universal health care and universal pre-k. I think in addition to a different approach to how we allocate existing revenues is my primary goal, I could envision a scenario where we ask the most well off Marylanders to pay their fair share to help build a more equitable, vibrant Maryland.","No. Maryland's Public Information Act still has a ways to go to be truly transparent. While efforts have been made to increase transparency, we are not where we need to be.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

I also have a master of public administration from the University of Baltimore and a Ph.D. in public policy from UMBC.,I am a data scientist. Data science is a branch of statistics and mathematics that focuses on using data to explain the world around us. It is commonly used in public policy and economics to understand the causes of problems and how government may be able to solve them.,"I support the recommendations of the Kirwan Commission. I am a firm believer in the value of education and the Kirwan Commission has provided many great ideas. For instance, a program to allow students to complete an associate's degree in high school would allow many students a head start. I, myself, through a similar program, completed 57 credits before graduating high school, and that set my education, career, and life on a trajectory I could not have otherwise obtained. At the same time, I am concerned about what the Commission does not say. In particular, the Commission does not address the importance of capital improvements to existing facilities and the need for new facilities. Some of our schools are in a horrid state of repair and this is not conducive to learning. If we want our children to learn, we should give them the best we can.","I spent years doing the long haul up and down I-95. It can take an hour just to cross the Inner Harbor so often, I just plan for it. Baltimore traffic jams are such a common occurrence that ask our phones to route us around them ahead of time, disrupting neighborhoods with increased traffic. Mass transit, designed to move traffic from Baltimore to DC, is no better. Trips into Baltimore are inconveniently timed and don't go where jobs are. We can't tell if spending between roads and transit is balanced since neither work very well. Our aging infrastructure is in constant risk of failure. We must improve both through upgrades and increased service and access.",Yes.,"The Chesapeake Bay is the lifeblood of our economy, our play, and our lives, in Maryland. There are still risks to the Bay and its use from increased development throughout the Chesapeake Bay watershed and climate change. To protect the watershed, we must begin looking at runoff holistically and not just considering the impact from development to development. This will allows to focus on both the long term health of the Bay and give us the chance to make sure short term changes to not have outsized effects.","We are fortunate, in Maryland, to have two top-tier world class medical institutions homed in Baltimore. But that does not help those who cannot afford to walk in the door. The Affordable Care Act was a large step forward to increasing access and protecting the most vulnerable. At the same time, many were still left in the lurch and recent Federal changes have gutted the program, killing its effectiveness. Maryland should embrace single-payer healthcare. This will cut emergency room wait times by allowing individuals to see a primary care physician rather than relying on the fact emergency rooms cannot turn anyone away. This allow those of us who can afford insurance to no longer worry about managing payments, copays, HSAs, and the insurance company. But most importantly, this will give the world class medical care we have to everyone.","The most important thing the state can do to address violent crime in Baltimore...or anywhere, is constrict the flow of the weapons of violence. Reducing access to assault weapons, expanding background checks, and buybacks. We know these policies work because Australia, Japan, the United Kingdom have all effectively cut gun violence through introducing these controls. We must also cut the motivation to resort to violent crime. Education, business opportunities, and jobs also are linked to reduced gun violence. Like many problems, there isn't a magic switch to flip. But make many small changes and take the problem apart piece-by-piece.","Maryland has a long-running reputation for being anti-business. But our state is in the top fifth of states by GDP per capita, beating the national average by roughly 10 percent every year for the last 10 years. Importantly, we also beat Virginia, our only real competitor for business. The anti-business reputation is unearned and undeserved and lives and amenities we have in Maryland show it. Maryland is great for business. Unless you're a starting a new business. Every business starts small and we have some of highest filing fees in the nation. For a small or microbusiness, annual filing fees can be as much as a tenth of your revenue. I know because I've paid them. We can make Maryland startup friendly by cutting filing fees and reducing other barriers to entry across the government. Because Maryland shouldn't be friendly to just big business.","Maryland should adopt an independent commission for both Congressional and state redistricting. The commission should be charged to create compact districts approximately equal in population. Finally, the courts should have the power to review, upon challenge, the district maps and the independent judiciary should be able to evaluate if the maps meet the requirements.","Some parts of the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights are critical. Reaffirming the right of officers to participate in political activities is important. Even limits on interrogations are reasonable. But there's a problem, not with the law, but with its implementation. The law itself clearly explains that it only applies during administrative investigations, for instance, for violating departmental rules on time cards. The Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights does not, by its own words, apply when a law enforcement officer is under investigation for criminal activity. Every time an allegation of excessive force is made, it is not an administrative matter. It is a criminal matter, but it gets handled administratively.. The problem is the implementation. We can see the outcome of this routine mishandling of cases in Baltimore City, where videos of evidence planting are routine and only a Federal prosecutor can stop misconduct.","This is one of the hardest problem facing policymakers today, and there is no simple solution. There are a great many small steps that will add up to a solution, however. The State must work with physicians, through their licensing boards, to constrain the flow of opioids since many addictions start with prescription. Second, the state must ensure that the prescriptions that are given out, for good reason, do not end up on the blackmarket. Finally, while programs such as NARCAN training are effective in the moment to save a life, they cannot prevent another overdose. The state can address this by also ensuring access to drug treatment and rehabilitation programs.","Maryland does have an income inequality problem, though ours is less than many East Coast states and the United States overall. As we look at smaller and smaller areas, counties, cities, and even neighborhoods, the inequities are much clearer than Maryland's Gini coefficient tells. We also know that education, especially higher education. can increase equality. Higher education, three of Maryland public universities, have made it possible for me to move into the middle class. Education provides access to stable jobs with good benefits. Our public universities are expensive and growing in cost well beyond inflation or incomes. Education is the great equalizer, not just in Maryland, or the United States, but everywhere. Providing a complete, affordable, and just education is critical to maintaining a healthy civic structure.","If properly used, yes. The problem with the open meetings laws, as they are now, is that there is no recourse for an aggrieved party except a strongly worded letter from the Open Meetings Compliance Board. Unless and until governmental entities are given consequences for their actions, there will be gaffes in the Acts.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

I did my graduate work at American University in Washington D.C., receiving a Masters of International Affairs in Comparative & Regional Studies of the Middle East with a concentration in Terrorism and Intelligence Studies. I also studied Intensive Beginning Chinese during my semester abroad at Beijing Language & Culture University in Beijing, China.","Prior to running for the House of Delegates, I worked as a terrorism researcher/analyst and project manager at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START), a DHS Centre of Excellence. I specialised in Unconventional Weapons and Technologies, particularly CBRN weapons and mass casualty terrorism.","While I strongly disagree with the rationale that was discussed by the commission for potentially eliminating the Geographic Cost of Education Index (GCEI), overall I have high hopes for the group's work. I hope they will come out in favor of increasing the state's commitment to capital investment in new and renovated schools, that they will support funding levels that truly allow all public schools to perform their core mission successfully, and - particularly in economically disadvantaged - that they will recommend much more comprehensive wraparound services. Strong support for community schooling in higher need districts is critical in my view. Bringing social and support services into the school environment not only provides greater access to children who really need them, it also helps educators focus on teaching and creating a successful classroom environment - rather than having to try and provide these other services that they are not trained or resourced for. It also creates a hub for other positive influence throughout the community. I also hope that the Commission's recommendations on supporting and developing teachers/administrators come with a realistic approach to how much money needs to be invested in this effort. A nice set of goals that tries to avoid costing too much would be a disappointment. Finally, I hope the benchmarking process that is developed is careful to assess schools in a way that does not chronically undermine institutions and systems in less economically advantaged areas.","No, the Baltimore region is NOT adequately served by public transit. The cancellation of the Red Line was a devastating blow to the city and, in my opinion, should not have been the case. I grew up in Baltimore City and still own a house there, so I am all too aware of how inadequate the road maintenance in the region is and how frustrating the rather abrupt switch-over the BaltimoreLink system was for many residents. I believe that we, as a state, need to invest in maintaining our existing roadways, carefully considering which proposed future roadway construction should be funded, and putting a premium on public transportation throughout the state. This latter concern is the future of so much of our state spending on transportation spending and we must utilise our resources wisely, prioritising projects with the most significant impact on the most number of residents. In Montgomery County, where I live and am seeking elected office, that means a dedicated funding stream for Metro, which the General Assembly just passed. I will defer to local officials in the Baltimore region as to how best organise their funding priorities, but this is not an issue that we can ignore.","Yes. One of the core platforms of my campaign in full legalisation of marijuana. I am myself a medical marijuana patient and advocate for legalisation. I believe we should use the taxation profits from a legal marijuana industry to create a dedicated funding stream for education and school construction. While bills to legalize marijuana have previously been introduced in the General Assembly, I believe there needs to be additional amendments to the bill requiring that the 50% of the tax revenues currently proposed to be earmarked for school be increased to 60% and that requires this revenue to be IN ADDITION TO, not as a supplement for, the state's required education contribution based on the school funding-formula. This requirement was not included in the legislation that legalized gambling in Maryland and as a result the state has used revenue from the gambling fund to meet the state's required contribution, rather than as an additional revenue stream. I also support expungement for those previously convicted of possessing small (non-dealer levels) of marijuana.","I support the continuation and enhancement of all current policies promoting cleaner water, reduction of algae blooms, and rejuvenation of shellfish populations. We are failing to meet our targets in part because we have not had the needed, tough conversations about commercial agriculture and storm-water run-off. I support smart growth and will fight fiercely for sensible regulations on impervious surfaces for any new development and to hold county decision makers accountable to environmental mitigation that is not just lip-service but grounded in science. In Annapolis, I will not shy away from taking the fight to the poultry industry and other major polluters. Additionally, we are part of a watershed, not an isolated ecosystem. We must find ways to work with lawmakers in neighboring states. to enact common sense solutions that get us back on track to a clean Bay. I support policies that require new developments to incorporate green infrastructure – specifically, including things such as roof parks to reduce stormwater runoff, cisterns for capturing rainwater to decrease runoff & for use in gardening, and the expansion of riparian buffer zones on new developments near waterfronts and/or with a high proportion of impervious services. The usage of porous surfaces should also be incentivized. I also support the Stormwater & Nutrient Credit Training, enacted with a comprehensive, clearly defined regulation structure at the state level in order to allow for credit trading.","I support single payer healthcare. Maryland is actually significantly further along the road to single payer than most states with our 'all payer' model which currently allows for the state to negotiate with major providers and institutions to set costs. I believe that expanding the breadth of this system carefully over the next few years would make Maryland a great case study in how states' can move toward true single payer systems even without increased support for the idea from the federal government. The reality is that while single payer would bring some cost savings efficiencies through negotiating power, it will also increase the costs to the state. As a proud progressive I am not afraid to say that the trade-off may mean raising certain sources of tax revenue. I would look forward to working closely with experienced colleagues and knowable budget experts to find the smartest models for beginning an expansion in this direction, but I think it's important to be honest with voters that the huge advantages of a single payer system will probably also mean everyone contributing to the costs – ideally through a progressive, not a regressive tax.","Violent crime in Baltimore is inextricably linked to lack of economic opportunity and social mobility. There are not easy levers for government to tackle all of the facets of this problem, but there is one clear obligation on the state: education. We need guaranteed universal pre-k for all children in Maryland, and we need a dramatic increase in support for community schools with comprehensive wraparound support services in Baltimore City. Evidence supporting the impact of these programs is overwhelming, and every day that we reduce another child's chances of success in life by not finding the funding for them is a shameful tragedy. How to deal with the day to day issue of violent crime right now? The Baltimore police department and court system struggle from chronic underfunding. The state could do more to help close the gaps that undermine the effectiveness of routine law enforcement.","I would characterize Maryland's business climate as 'underperforming.' Given our geography, the demographics of our population, and our access to global transportation hubs, I believe we could do much better. Again, this is a challenging policy question, though. I don't believe the answer is simply to try and race to the bottom on corporate taxes and incentive packages to lure big employers to Maryland. Instead, I think we need to double down on supporting our homegrown knowledge economy. I know, first hand as a former researcher at the University of Maryland, that the state could do far more to support investment in startups and public private partnerships in the biotech and biomedical industries, as well as many others in which we already have leading intellectual talent right here. We have the potential to be the silicon valley of the medical technology field as a state, but we are failing to move aggressively enough to capitalize on our advantages. In Annapolis, I would be focused on strategies the state can take to make Maryland the best state to start a knowledge-based startup company and attract the biggest employers in the fields we already have strength in – rather than doing what the legislature has authorized for the Amazon HQ2 package – which frankly feels like a fire sale.","Yes, I believe that both congressional and legislative district lines should be changed. The creation of these districts should be the purview of an independent, nonpartisan commission.","No, I don't believe that it presently does adequately balance protections for police and the public. In my opinion, there needs to be more civilian oversight.","I believe that we need to address the opioid crisis on two fronts. First off, we need to recognise that addition is a physical disease. And this means taking steps to provide those who are addicted to opioids with every available resource, including safe injection sites. We also need to recognise the crucial role that medication therapy can play in helping those addicted to opioids transition to sobriety. There is far too much stigma surrounding methadone and other non-narcotic opioid medication therapies as 'just trading one drug for another' and that is emphatically and scientifically NOT the reality of the situation. These medications are incredibly helpful to those trying to get off of opioid drugs and we should be supporting and advocating for increased access to them, rather than contributing to the stigmatisation and ghettoisation of these proven treatment options.","Honestly, the vast majority of what can conceivably be done to address income inequality would have to happen at the federal, rather than the state, level. However, there are important things that CAN be done at the state level – the most crucial of which is fully funding the Child Care Subsidy Program. I believe early childhood education is a critical social justice issue. We must ensure that this program is made a true priority to fund the CCSP at a level that eliminates wait lists and pays a living wage to childcare workers. I fully support a diverse system for providing universal pre-K, including family childcare/childcare centers in diverse formats including these and nursery schools, Montessori schools, religious schools, co-ops, as well as part time and half day programs that families in their unique ways. I will make it a priority not only to fully fund the state Child Care Subsidy Program, but to pass the $15/hour minimum wage bill – with indexing to reflect the cost of inflation - that will ensure that childcare providers are compensated at the level commensurate with their important role in our society. I also support an indexing provision to ensure that the minimum wage at least keeps pace with inflation in the future.","I believe that the current laws are adequate, but there is always room for improvement and I would be happy to push for additional public oversight in Annapolis.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

I also worked for over 38 years for Baltimore County Government dealing with Fair Practices, Community Affairs and Human Resources.","As one of eight Legislative Members serving on the Commission, I support the Commission's preliminary recommendations and look forward to the completion of our work prior to the end of this calendar year.. I am committed to funding the associated reforms through our work during the 2018 interim to develop greater specificity for each of our recommendations in order to ""cost out"" their fiscal impact. As a result, we will be in a better position to make recommendations for adequate funding in our final 2018 report.","It is my opinion at the present time, Maryland's transportation spending is not appropriately balanced between roads and transit. Legislation that passed during the 2018 Legislative Session will go a long way in addressing the resources needed. The closure of the Baltimore Metro Subway in February of this year brought attention to the Maryland Transit Authority Operating Budget which was not increased annually to keep up with inflation. House Bill 372 -Maryland Metro/Transit Funding Act which requires the MTA's Operating Budget to grow at least 4.4%(year over year) for fiscal years 2020-2022, requires a supplemental appropriation of $29.1 million in fiscal years 2020-2022 for the capital needs of the MTA. MTA is also required to develop the Central Maryland Regional Transit Plan to meet the needs of it's ""core service area""(those jurisdictions that are served by light rail, metro, or fixed bus route service) by October 1, 2020.",I am personally opposed to the legalization of recreational marijuana.,We should continue to work with our Federal Partners to press the importance of the resoration as well as be in dialog with the six other states who along with Maryland signed on to the Chesapeake Bay Program in order to protect this valuable resource.,The Maryland House of Delegates already took steps by forming an Affordable Care Act Workgroup to address the issue of the rising cost of care due to insurance market uncertainty and the individual mandate repeal by Congress. There were two key pieces of Legislation passed this Legislative Session to address the two issues: HB1795-Maryland Health Benefit Exchange -Establishment of a Reinsurance Program- Will lower premiums in the individual market by seeking a Federal waiver for flexibility to use Federal funds to help create a state-run reinsurance program. HB1782-Health Insurance-Individual Market Stablization(Maryland Health Care Access Act of 2018)- Will authorize the State to collect 2.75%($380 million) in suspended federal fees from insurance companies to pay for a state reinsurance pool. It also requires a study to explore further long-term solutions for the insurance industry and stabilize individual market rates.,"The state's role would be to provide resources to deter an individual from getting to a place where violent crime would even be a way of life. Starting early in a child's life with early childcare education, where a child can learn that he or she is important and that learning is the way to be a success in life. The state's role is to not make guns so easy to purchase for those who use them for the sole purpose to kill another person and to keep repeat offenders off the street. The state's role is to work in concert with the City in addressing this violent epidemic.","I would characterize Maryland's business climate as good for those doing well economically, not as good for those who are not. The state has and can foster the creation of more family-supporting jobs by expanding access to education, including college and career technology programs, by giving incentives to small businesses to provide their low- income workers with paid sick leave, by increasing the childcare subsidy rates to provide higher-quality and lower cost child care to low-income families, by providing wrap- around services in the community where the family lives and/or works to name a few.","Yes, if the body is truly non-partisan and truly independent.","I do not feel the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights adequately balances protections for police and the public. I feel it needs to be reviewed to determine if it adequately addresses the changes that law enforcement face today from pre Freddie Gray,usage of body cameras as well as other 21st Century Law Enforcement technology. Just as there are Police Citizens Academies to enlighten the public on what Police Officers go through on their jobs and their type of training, there should be a similar vehicle for the Police Officers to go through from the Community's perspective.","The House through HB 1092-Behavorial Health Crisis Response Grant Program will establish a competitive grant program that awards funding to local behavioral health organizations to expand capabilities of crisis reponse programs and services. These programs and services include: mobile crisis teams, 24/7 walk-in services, crisis residential beds as well as other crisis reponse programs. I also feel that Doctors need to be cognizant of the type of prescriptions that they write for pain for their patients or at a clinic or at an emergency room that is an opioid when something else less addicting could be prescribed for the pain.","Although Maryland is considered the most wealthiest state in the Nation, Baltimore City has the highest level of income inequality, followed by Talbot and Worcester Counties. The State should really do an assessment of what needs to be done and what can be done in the highest level of income inequality areas. Look at what other states have done to close the gap. Think outside of the box, ask the people living in those areas, what they think, what they feel needs to be done to close the gap.",It depends on the perspective of the individual.

As Chairman of the Ways & Means Committee, I play a key role in guiding K-12 education policy, and I also serve on the Kirwan Commission. Given that a budget is a reflection of our values and priorities, and given that education is our #1 priority, we must increase education funding in order to meet the recommendations of the Kirwan Commission.","I support a robust public transportation system with dedicated funding. I also believe that road improvements, and in some cases, new roads are needed to ensure a comprehensive transportation infrastructure. Our state's economy may be impeded in the future if we do not make better progress in transit-oriented development and committing to other infrastructure improvements.","I voted in favor of medical marijuana. I also voted in favor of decriminalizing possession of small amounts marijuana. I remain open, but not committed, to voting for legalization in the future after we learn and analyze the experiences from Colorado and Washington State.","Offshore drilling, suburban sprawl and road congestion are major problems Maryland must continue to address. We must invest in and protect the health of the Chesapeake Bay, the crown jewel of our state.

Allowing law abiding citizens to conceal carry should also help deter violent crime because criminals are not looking over their shoulders when they gun down seniors, children, and people making something of themselves if they are willing to kill innocent bystanders other than other criminals then local citizens should be able to defend themselves.","Eliminate the corporate tax, reduce taxes on Maryland based businesses, create incentives for people creating small businesses in our state.","Yes, the power of drawing legislative and congressional districts should be given to the State Board of Elections.","As far as i have read i believe it does it just depends if it is followed, that makes all the difference.",Provide necessary funds from the state and give them to all 24 counties and baltimore city to fund specific fire houses as locations for people to hand in their drugs and receive treatment.,Nothing.,"They do only to the degree that the citizens participate in actually exercising their ability to conduct oversight on government functions by going to public meetings, writing letters, making phone calls and on occasion demonstrating in the community when necessary.

,YES,state-house,43,Nilesh Kalyanaraman,Kalyanaraman,1/20/1976,Baltimore,Democratic,Baltimore City,http://www.nileshmd43.com,NileshMD43,nileshmd43,,"I earned a B.S. in chemistry at Yale in New Haven, CT (1997) and then went to medical school at SUNY Downstate in Brooklyn, NY (2003). I did my internal medicine residency at Emory University and Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, GA (2006). Mid-career, I completed a AAAS (American Association for the Advancement of Science) Policy & Technology Fellowship at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, MD (2011).","I am a primary care doctor and I work at Heath Care for the Homeless. HCH is a community health center and we provide care to over 10,000 people experiencing homelessness at multiple locations throughout Baltimore City and County. I've been with HCH for 6 years, am the Chief Health Officer and I oversee our medical, behavioral health, dental and supportive housing services. Additionally, I provide primary care and addictions treatment to our patients. Prior to that I was at People's Community Health Center on Greenmount Ave for less than a year where I was the site medical director. Prior to that I was at the AAAS Science & Technology policy fellow at the NIH (see above). And prior to that, I was at Unity Health Care, a community health center in Washington DC, for 4 years. At Unity I provided care to inmates in the city jail and to the working poor and uninsured in the community.","I support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education. These recommendations will invest in early childhood education, provide more resources for at-risk students, develop high quality teachers and provide college and vocational readiness programs. The one area that is missing is an explicit examination of the racial inequities in our current system and interventions to address these inequities. I am committed to fully funding these reforms through general appropriations and through dedicated casino money that was meant to supplement our current educational funds. Once the final funding formula is not out we will see if further funds are needed.","Maryland's transportation spending needs to move towards transit and away from roads. Increasing transit leads to a growing population in the city and region, increases the number of jobs and produces increased economic activity. The state needs to allocate funding to invest in the Baltimore region and can do so through direct funding and bonds. BaltimoreLink is not meeting the needs of our residents at this time. Baltimore will prosper when we implement an integrated rail, bus and train system that shortens commute and wait times and increases access to transit for all.","I support the decriminalization of marijuana and would support legalizing marijuana if we include safeguards to address the inevitable health issues that would come with legalization. African Americans have been targeted as part of the war on drugs and are disproportionately involved in the criminal justice system for offenses related to marijuana. Legalization would eliminate this problem. At the same time, there are adverse health effects from smoking marijuana and from heavy marijuana use. In states where marijuana has been legalized, marijuana use has gone up in both adults and youth. With legalization we should have strict limits on marijuana advertising, prohibit advertising of products intended to increase youth use (as we've seen with vaping) and increase funding for treatment.","The Chesapeake Bay is a vital resource for Maryland. From fishing to farming to tourism, Maryland's well-being depends on the health of the Bay. There are a number of steps we can take to protect the bay now so that future generations have a healthy functioning bay. Let's improve the management of the over 400,000 septic systems so that waste doesn't spill into the bay. We also should invest in improving our sewer infrastructure to prevent spilling and overflow into our waters. Lastly, let's enforce the critical area buffer and restore streams and shorelines to limit the amount of pollution that runs off into waters that feed the bay.","As a primary care doctor I have been leading the fight for affordable, universal health care. Maryland can and should invest in health care to improve the health of its residents. We should work to ensure access to health care despite the federal government's efforts to diminish access to health coverage. We can do this by promoting auto-enrollment in Medicaid and by using tax returns to coordinate with the health exchange to make it easier to enroll in insurance by using potential tax penalties as payments for insurance. We should also set up a drug cost commission to set reasonable prices for high cost drugs. Requiring medication and health services price transparency will help us identify and address the highest cost care. Additionally, implementing a basic health plan to cover a certain segment of the low-income population would help increased coverage. Lastly, let's expand access to dental care for Medicaid recipients.","Baltimore's violent crime response should be supported through state funding and oversight. Our predominant response to the violence in Baltimore has been as a policing and criminal justice issue. We need to approach violence as a public health issue since trauma, injury and death are best handled as health issues. To do this we should: Expand Safe Streets to all communities with violence and at risk for violence. Safe Streets employs people from affected communities to intervene with at risk young people to break the cycle of violence. Additionally, this program should be moved back to the Health Department. Increase funding for community recreation centers and mentoring programs to keep children engaged in positive and productive activities. Expand Operation Safe Kids to include more youth who are at risk of committing or being the victims of violent crime. Increase violence deterrence programs that work with individuals at risk of committing violence by providing intensive mental health, medical and case management services coupled with intensive monitoring. Aggressive removal of guns through a state-city collaboration that targets areas of high gun violence.","Maryland has a strong business climate. In a recent survey of the Maryland businesses, 65% expect their market to grow and 80% saw Maryland's business climate as business-friendly or neutral. Now is the time to foster family-supporting job growth by increasing the minimum wage to better support individuals and families. This additional income will get spent in local businesses which provides overall benefits to the economy. We should also provide paid family leave so that people can take care of their loved ones and keep their jobs. Increasing the availability of affordable child care through increased subsidies will allow people to stay in their jobs and allow more people to enter or re-enter the workforce. Lastly, we should give workers two weeks advance notice of their schedules so they can arrange for their family needs.","I support the creation of a non-partisan, independent body to draw our legislative and congressional districts. Our faith in our government rests on knowing that our elected officials represent their residents and are not in power because their districts are rigged to give them an advantage. A non-partisan system should prioritize using existing boundaries for cities and counties to determine legislative boundaries. Districts should also be constructed to encourage competition.","The Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights should change to better protect our residents. In Baltimore, abuses by the police department have deepened community mistrust of the police. To rebuild the trust between the police and our communities, we should include civilians in the disciplinary and investigation process. This is critical in making the police accountable to the people they serve. Additionally, we should eliminate the 90-day limitation on filing a complaint against an officer. Lastly, we should decrease the number of days an officer can take before they can be questioned in an investigation from 10 to 5.",Maryland has been aggressive in combating the opioid addiction and overdose crisis. We should continue to treat opioid addiction as a chronic disease and expand how we treat this illness. We should: Provide addiction treatment including medication assisted treatment in all jails and prisons. Increase pre-trial diversion programs to send low-level offenders into drug treatment programs. Increase post-incarceration treatment. Expand availability of naloxone and train community members to use it. Identify high volume opioid dispensing pharmacies and target them for enforcement along with the pharmaceutical and distribution companies involved in those high-volume sales. Invest in community mental health and addictions treatment to provide on demand care.,"Income inequality leads to decreased opportunities, education and health throughout a person's life. The level of income inequality we see is unfair to our poorer residents and is damaging to the health of our society. Let's address income inequality by: Increasing the minimum wage to $15. Investing in early childhood education through expanded Head Start enrollment and universal pre-K. Ending racial and income segregation of neighborhoods by investing in mixed income housing which includes both low and middle-income housing. Increasing school funding to compensate for low-income districts. Diverting people from prison and investing in re-entry programs.",The state's Public Information Act is performing well since being updated in 2015. It has enabled us to better understand the actions of our government and hold our officials accountable. The main area where it can be modified is to give indigent individuals a mandatory fee waiver to get materials related to themselves.,"Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

This is followed by a commitment to stay with the employer for an agreed-upon period of time following the completion of the apprenticeship.","I support a national approach to redistricting rather an a state-by-state approach.

A fresh look at the bill is appropriate in view of events that have unfolded since its inception.","The opiod crisis requires, at a minimum, on-demand treatment in an inpatient facility. Additionally, medical cannabis shows promise in treating chronic pain without the addictive properties and withdrawal potential. Additionally, opiods, over time, are less effective in treating pain requiring larger and more dangerous doses. Mandatory treatment after the administering of Narcan with follow-up in patient treatment available are the first steps we should take in addressing this crisis.","Income derived from investments, where that is the taxpayers main source of income, should be taxed at the prevailing rate rather than to capital gains rate.","As a member of the Frederick County Board of Education, I see the volume of PIA requests we receive and how responsive our staff is in addressing citizen inquiries.

Manufacturer Representative Agency","I do support many of the reforms suggested. However, I do not believe we can move forward with increasing funding for public education without first establishing a statewide inspector general office as suggestion by Governor Hogan in the recent legislative session. There have been far too many cases of scandal in our public school systems and before we increase funding we need to establish a better system to guard against theft, waste, corruption, and mismanagement. Each year the legislature passes tens of millions of dollars worth of new spending mandates. I believe we should have a moratorium on new spending to allow state resources to be directed to education, specifically to reduce class size and make teacher pay more competitive.","I support Governor Hogan's plan to fix all deficient bridges, roads, and to support every local government's top road projects. He's made great strides to alleviate some of the most dangerous and congested roads problems statewide. He's also supporting mass transit projects that make economic sense including the purple line that is being completed for far less dollars than the previous administration projected. I applaud the Hogan administration's modernization of the bus routes in Baltimore City with BaltimoreLink and expect that the Governor will continue to make progress improving the transportation system in the region.",I support Maryland's Medical Cannabis program.,"Maryland is making great progress to clean up the Chesapeake Bay. Governor Hogan has fully funded the Chesapeake and Atlantic Coastal Bays trust fund each year. Those resources are being used to make capital improvements that, with many other investments, are producing measurable improvements. I am also very excited to see real efforts going into a pilot project, initiated by Governor Hogan, to dredge the Conowingo Dam and recent EPA coordinated efforts to develop a real long term solution to this problem.",We worked this session to establish a reinsurance program for our individual group market. This will mitigate the risk of insured individuals with high costs to produce a more affordable overall market. Prices have to be affordable for health people to purchase insurance.,The state is supporting the city with new laws that will get tougher on repeat violent offenders; I am so glad to see that those bills passed this session. We are also supporting the city with many millions in new funding to attack the crime problem with preventative measures such as the safe streets initiatives. I am also supportive of existing programs that are currently being utilized to allow law enforcement from many agencies both state and local to help improve safety in the region.,"With Governor Hogan Maryland has begun to shed it's anti-business culture. State agencies are working to support job creators and he's helped us stop the constant parade of tax and fee increases. Maryland policy makers need to realize that we compete with other states in the region, nation, and world for jobs. Our corporate tax rate continues to be far too high in comparison to other states in our region, lowering this would be an important fix to help us attract more jobs.",Yes.

BA from the University of Southern California.  Masters from Johns Hopkins University.  JD from University of Maryland School of Law.,"Outside of the session, I work as an attorney at a law firm in Washington, DC.","Yes. I voted in favor of HB 1415, which implements the initial reforms. Next year we will address recommends adjusting the state's funding formulas. We should tie these changes to specific revenues, something that did not occur when the Thornton Commission last addressed these education funding questions. What specific revenues would be tied to education would need to be addressed in the 2019 legislation session, as there are many options. I also voted for the education funding ""lockbox"" constitutional amendment, which will provide some additional funding from existing resources (SB 1122).","All modes of transportation need to be supported, but I believe we should prioritize transit. I was proud to sponsor the Maryland Metro/Transit Funding Act (HB 372), which provides additional funding for both the DC and Baltimore City area transit systems. Much more needs to be done and this could include the need for more funding to pay for improved transit--and other modes--throughout the state. Infrastructure investment has bipartisan support and should be pursued aggressively.","Yes, I co-sponsored HB 1264 to put this question on the ballot.","Maryland has achieved its 2017 statewide target for reducing phosphorous and sediment, but not nitrogen. The first steps Maryland must take are meeting its current goals. Moreover, Maryland has not met its urban/suburban stormwater goals for phosphorous and sediment. A detailed analysis of the pollutants going into the Bay must be undertaken so that each point and non-point source can be addressed at the source level.","Maryland's embrace of the Affordable Care Act and All Payer hospital payment system has paid dividends. But we must continue to look at new models for healthcare, such as single payer, to ensure that our citizens have access to high quality care that they can afford. Until that occurs, Maryland must continue its interim efforts to make the individual and small group markets more affordable. I voted for legislation to establish a reinsurance program, but we must also consider following Massachusetts' path and having a state level individual mandate to encourage market participation.","The state should continue to invest in education, Safe Streets, infrastructure, after school, and other programs in Baltimore City. The urge to ""do something"" by passing bumper sticker legislation is understandable, but the best way to decrease crime in Baltimore is to create jobs, improve education, and ensure people have access to safe and affordable homes. That is where the state can be helpful, while allowing Baltimore's local government and police to do their jobs with over-arching state oversight.","Maryland's business climate could always improve. I believe the state can help create jobs in many ways, but two specific approaches are continued investment in infrastructure and sensible prioritization in key industries in which we thrive, such as biotech, cyber security, and other industries that relate to the federal government entities in the state. Maryland can do that through targeted tax programs, centers of excellence at our institutions of higher education, investment programs such as TEDCO, and loan programs through the state Department of Commerce.","I would like to see that reform take place in every state. In the meantime, I co-sponsored the bipartisan HB 1022 to apply some sensible rules to how Congressional district lines are drawn: compactness, continuity, and respect for political subdivisions.","Although it is of the utmost important that we protect the leigitimate rights of the accused, it has seemed as though some of the procedural provisons of the Law Enforcemnt Officers Bill of Rights have made it difficult to investigate police misconduct. I would support continued work to address these issues.","There is no single strategy to address a crisis that affects every region of the state and country. Unfortunately, the latest quarterly figures from Maryland show an increase to 1,501 opiod-related deaths, up from 1,344 in 2016 and a major jump from 390 ten years ago. The issue can only be addressed through a comprehensive approach that includes changing how doctors and pharmacies provide medicated opiods, education and prevention, and significant substance abuse treatment. We must also ensure that there is sufficent access to Naloxone and that good samaritan laws allow people to help one another. But, again, this requires a much broader and forceful approach than any indivdual legislator or state can bring to the table.","The state can take significant action to address income inequality.  The biggest step would be continuing to increase our investment in education and make the investment more effective. But providing affordable healthcare, universal pre-k, access to colleage, affordable housing, and access to childcare are also all, necessary steps to help those struggling to succeed and take advantage of our state's many opportunities.  There are many existing programs in these areas, but significant improvement and investment is required.","No. I have introduced legislation to improve government transparency. For example, the Board of Public Works Transparency Act (now law), requires the Board to post proposed budget cuts before adopting them.  The State Board of Elections Transparency Act would have required live streaming of the Board's meetings.  The bill did not pass, but the Board does now post the audio of their meetings.  HB 1281 of the current session would have required the State Highway Administration to publicly release certain documents.  There is still a long way to go to improve government transparency.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education? Are you committed to funding associated reforms, and if so, how?","Is Maryland’s transportation spending appropriately balanced between roads and transit?

They need to consider the impact on student performance from the money spent after the Thornton Commission and subsequent Bridge to Excellence in Public Schools Act of 2002 that invested $1.3 billion in additional State aid.   Maryland students' performance is average at best within the United States despite our investment in preK-12 education.  We must focus on high-quality preK-12 programs and student outcomes, not just additional seat time and spending more money.  Throwing money at the same mediocre system will not change anything- our situation is unacceptable.  ""How"" money is spent is just as important as ""How Much"" money is spent.   What has been the impact on student achievement?   ie.  What impact has mandatory full day Kindergarten and pre-K for low income individuals had on student outcomes? Are our children prepared for first grade?  Are our children reading on grade level by the 3rd grade?  These are fundamental measures that are essential for early literacy and must be mastered before moving on into the content areas. I support their concept of putting rigorous accountability measures in place and not accept the status quo- it can be done. We have some excellent schools already in place in Maryland, but this needs to be replicated in all regions of the state.","Maryland's transportation system is out of balance because only 5-7% of trips are taken on mass transit, yet 54% of the Transportation Trust Fund revenues (coming almost entirely from motorists) are spent on mass transit.  Governor Hogan has made great strides in readjusting our transportation priorities to ensure that roads and bridges are taken care of too.  Over the last 3 years, Hogan has ensured that every bridge in Maryland is structurally sound and over ½ of all state roads have had long overdue paving.  There are more transportation projects in the pipeline than ever before in the Maryland's history. The shrinking population in Baltimore is adequately served by the Baltimore Metro and the new Baltimore Link.  The Baltimore Link has expanded opportunities and jobs and provides better service to more communities in the Baltimore region than the previous transit system.  The Red Line would have only impacted the few communities along tit's single east/ west metro line.  The Red Line was never approved under the 8 years of the O'Malley administration and it was a boondoggle from the beginning - hundreds of millions of dollars were wasted for an ill-conceived plan with irresponsible funding forecasts.  Governor Hogan has worked to restore the local government's Highway User Revenues  (HURs)- which was cut by 90% during the O'Malley years.  Baltimore City will now have the HURs to spend to maintain their roads and fill potholes.","I do not support the legalization of recreational marijuana.  Legalized marijuana creates high costs for society and taxpayers that far outweigh its tax revenues and harms more than just the person using the drug. Societal costs include increased medical and mental health care, addiction treatment, more victims of drugged driving accidents, increased crime and domestic violence and a negative impact on health from secondhand smoke. We are seeing more and more illegal marijuana laced with other harmful chemicals like rat poison. The legal ""medical"" cannabis industry in Maryland has just begun to get up and running and that industry is still in its infancy.  Medical cannabis will give Marylanders the products they have been requesting to relieve medical conditions and the product will be controlled for safety and quality.  This product is available through a doctor's recommendation.","I am pleased that the President and Congress have reconfirmed their commitment to restoring the Chesapeake Bay through their budget process.  The Hogan administration has also made cleaning up the Bay a top priority and I support those efforts. Our efforts to reduce storm water runoff and upgrade our wastewater treatment plants throughout the state are already paying large dividends. The most important priority is to treat the Susquehanna River pollution as a major part of bay-wide restoration strategies.  Sediment and nitrogen flow down the Susquehanna River from Pennsylvania and the northern states into the Conowingo Dam.  The dam is filled with sediment and no longer is stopping pollution from flowing into the bay. I support finding real solutions like the test project Governor Hogan funded to dredge the sediment trapped behind the Conowingo Dam.  Without dredging the dam- one big storm could wipe out recent improvements in the Chesapeake Bay's health.  We also have committed resources to oyster restoration in the Bay and have established the Maryland Energy Institute, as part of the James Clark School of Engineering at the University of Maryland , to attract clean energy investment and to develop additional clean energy programs.  They are tasked with developing and attracting private investment in clean energy innovation and commercialization in the State.","There are many steps that need to be taken to ensure access to affordable health care beginning with focusing on the ""cost of heathcare"" and not the ""cost of health insurance"".  Serving on the Heath and Government Operations Committee in the Legislature, I continue to support policies that will shed light on the cost drivers of healthcare.   1) Cost of Prescription drugs – FDA approval process is long and cumbersome.  We need a better understanding of the supply chain and pricing  2) Forcing transparency in costs for health care services and medical procedures  3) Encouraging users of healthcare service to have some ""skin in the game"" when it comes to purchasing medical services  4) Chronic disease management/lifestyle choices – the single most important risk factor for Type 2 Diabetes is obesity   5) Removing barriers for the use of telemedicine  6) Controlling hospital costs – Maryland is working on this through our unique rate setting system 7) Fixing our tort system that forces doctors to use defensive medicine and request unnecessary tests  8) Discouraging use of the emergency room and providing for more 24 hour clinics 9) Reevaluate Certificate of Need laws that stymie competition. 10) Encourage least costly venue for procedures– significant payment differential when procedure is performed at an out- patient hospital compared to a physician's office","I supported the recently passed a package of initiatives called the Comprehensive Crime Act of 2018 aimed at curbing violent crime in Baltimore.  Courts have grown too soft on violent crime and we need to get tougher.  We now will have mandatory sentences for repeat violent offenders who use guns in the commission of their crimes.  Drug King Pins will get mandatory minimum sentences and new ""truth in sentencing"" will require second-time violent criminals to serve their full sentence and make them ineligible for parole.  The individuals committing murders in Baltimore City have been arrested –on average- on nine previous occasions - 86% using illegal firearms. The State has committed transformational multi-year investments in programs aimed at addressing violent crime in Baltimore and across our state. Governor Hogan has expedited the demolition of vacant homes in high-crime areas and pledged support from the State Police in high crime areas. With Baltimore reeling from its third year in a row of more than 300 homicides and being named the most violent city in America- this is nothing to be proud of.  The crime spree in Baltimore did not happen overnight but it is obvious that the current practices in Baltimore are not working.","Maryland's business climate has improved dramatically over the last 3 years since Governor Hogan became Governor and declared that Maryland was ""Open for Business"".  We have reduced taxes, fees and regulations and state government employees are now focused on treating those they serve as ""customers"".  Customer service is evident in every department in state government. We passed the Governor's More Jobs for Marylanders Act of 2017 that provides tax credits for specified business entities that locate their businesses in qualified target areas across the state and we passed tax incentives for small businesses to invest in equipment to grow their businesses. However, there is a constant battle with a faction of the Legislature who wants to impose more and more requirements on small businesses like mandatory ""Paid Sick Leave"" and increasing the minimum wage, which will inhibit the growth of small businesses.  We are still working on getting our tax policy competitive with our surrounding states.","Yes, I support the creation of a non-partisan, independent body to draw legislative and congressional district maps after each census.   I was a cosponsor of Governor Hogan's Redistricting Reform Act of 2018 which would have instituted an independent, nonpartisan redistricting process to ensure free and fair elections in Maryland.  This legislation would have, once and for all, removed the politics and politicians from the process of drawing their own districts. The Act would have provided for a nonpartisan redistricting commission and would have created a fair, nonpartisan, open and transparent redistricting process.  This would have put Maryland on a new path toward transparency, representation and election integrity.  The vast majority of Marylanders support bipartisan redistricting reform.  Unfortunately, the Legislature failed to take a vote on act on this commonsense legislation-  now it is up to the Supreme Court to weigh in-  one way or another, we must change the process that we currently have- it is broken. Elections districts should be compact, contiguous and keep communities of interest together and not cross political boundaries such as counties and towns.","The Law Officers Bill of Rights does not need to be changed.  It was put in place in the 1970s to protect the rights of Maryland's law enforcement community.  The bill was to give police officers certain rights that were being abused in certain jurisdictions.  City officers were being suspended without evidence, forced to take lie detectors without being told of the charges against them and not given other rights enjoyed by ordinary citizens.  The LOBOR has worked well across the state in protecting officers, the police agency and the citizens.   Substantial changes were requested this year because of the illegal police activity of the highly publicized Gun Trace Force in Baltimore City.  Unfortunately, many policy decisions in Annapolis are driven by one jurisdiction- Baltimore City. The changes suggested this year to the LOBOR would not have benefited Carroll County law enforcement or our citizens – we have the proper balance currently.  We should be careful not to pass laws to address one jurisdictions problems that impact another jurisdiction negatively.  I support allowing Baltimore City to adopt their own Law Officers Bill of Rights if they so choose, but the rest of the state should not have to be impacted.","I support Governor Hogan's declaration of a State of Emergency over the Heroin and Opioid Crisis and his establishment of an Operational Command Center to coordinate and direct resources, best practices and communication throughout  Maryland.  We need a coordinated strategy with local governments and within communities.  There are many moving parts to this drug epidemic.  The major source of the opioid epidemic is prescription drugs, then progressing to heroin- often laced with deadly chemicals such as Fentanyl and Carfentenyl. I cosponsored legislation creating a Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) that would identify overprescribers (pill mill doctors), educating doctors as to proper pain medication dosages and alternative pain management and educating the public as to the root cause of this epidemic. We have deployed an ""all hands on deck"" response in Carroll County and convened an Opioid Senior Policy Group, of which I am a member.  The group includes the health department, law enforcement,  Carroll County Public Schools, Carroll Hospital, Access Carroll, Emergency Medical Services (EMS), emergency room doctors, social services, treatment providers, 911 dispatch and other interested parties. We have spread the message to our schools, churches, community groups and health providers. Our entire community will need to help us be part of the solution.  The Maryland Department of Health is running television ads to bring attention to the urgency of this emergency - Education is key.","The State's role in addressing income inequality is to ensure an excellent education for every student and to provide an environment for economic opportunity – JOBS- for everyone.  Currently in Maryland, we have the lowest unemployment rate in decades and many high paying jobs are left unfilled.  We often have to go out of state to recruit qualified employees. Given that Maryland has the highest per capita income in the nation, every citizen should have the opportunity to work at a level so that they can provide for themselves and their family.   Focusing our education system, both K-12 and post-secondary, on career ready skills is essential. Community Colleges must be used for job training and retraining and meeting the needs of the workforce and our employers. We also must ensure that our students and workers have the soft skills necessary to be employed like showing up on time- ready to work and good communication skills.  These skills are developed early on and must be reinforced our schools and at home.","We have tightened up Maryland's Public Information Act-PIA and Open Meetings Laws, but there is always work to be done. The public's right to oversight of the government lies at the heart of a democratic government.  Maryland's PIA gives citizens a broad right of access to public records while protecting legitimate governmental interests and the privacy of individual citizens.  Each level of government and each agency controls the requests for public information. We need to ensure that citizens are provided this information timely and completely.  Fees may not be used to discourage requesters, the first two hours of search and preparation are received without charge and we have limited the costs allowed to be charged to only direct costs such as copying. Many government agencies are putting more and more public information online to make it easily available. I passed legislation a couple of years ago that required public posting of meeting agendas within a certain timeframe prior to holding a meeting.  The public should not only have public notice of a meeting, they should know what will be on the agenda for that meeting. I cosponsored Governor Hogan's Transparency Act of 2018 which required the broadcasting of floor debates and voting sessions of the Maryland General Assembly.  Maryland is one of only 7 states in the nation that does not live stream deliberations-it is past time that Legislature's deliberations  be available to the public.  Maryland citizens deserve accountability and transparency from their elected leaders.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education? Are you committed to funding associated reforms, and if so, how?","Is Maryland’s transportation spending appropriately balanced between roads and transit?

,YES,state-house,42A,Stephen Lafferty,Lafferty,2/28/1949,Baltimore,Democratic,Baltimore County,http://www.delegatelafferty.com,steve.lafferty.12,,,"JD, University of Baltimore School of Law MA, American Studies, Bowling Green State University BA, American Studies, UMCP Teachers Certificate, Towson University","Attorney in private practice Administrator and Manager for Baltimore County, Howard County and State of Maryland in economic and community development Teacher in Baltimore City Public Schools","I certainly do.  We need to be bold and address issues of inequity in the state's schools, strengthen support systems in the schools, recruit and retain high quality teachers, expand career and technical education and strengthen accountability. I am committed to supporting funding for reforms laid out by the Kirwin Commission. As a legislator, I voted to support a ""lock box"" to provide additional funding for education from casino revenues and to fence off $200 million for future reforms from the Commission. Individual aspects, such as improvements in teaching education and preparation can also be funded through departmental and institutional budgets.","I believe there is an imbalance in favor of roads.  We must ensure our roads and bridges are safe. I supported a new formula to provide more highway revenue to counties in the state so they can also address local road improvements.  However, road widenings and improvements, alone cannot address the transportation needs of the Baltimore Region.  Cancelling the Red Line was short sighted and damaging to east-west transportation.  We must expand transit in order to meet the needs of those who  do not have motor vehicles and for the growing employment centers like Trade Point Atlantic, the airport and Arundel Mills and Hunt Valley. Early analysis indicates that BaltimoreLink has not improved service nor benefited more people. I also hope that a new Baltimore County Executive will support and provide transit services. The transportation needs of the region, and state, are greater than the resources we currently have.","I look forward to more discussion and debate about legalization. I believe that more Marylanders support such a change in the laws regarding the use of marijuana. I would like to see a study, however, of the social, health and economic impacts in other states where it is legal before finally committing to legalization.","As a legislator for 12 years, I have worked tirelessly to protect the Chesapeake Bay and the waters of the state.  I have been honored and recognized for my work. We need to double down on all sectors that contribute to the Bay's pollution.  We need to continue supporting new technologies to find ways of disposing of, or reusing, chicken litter. We need continued attention to agricultural run-off. We should expand the use of the best available technology to reduce nitrogen pollution from septic systems. My legislation this year should enable more counties to address septic pollution.  The Department of the Environment (MDE) needs to be more aggressive in enforcing discharge permits so that wastewater plants comply.   We must also expand and increase funding to reduce stormwater run-off and the pollution it creates. It is unclear whether each county has allocated adequate funds to address their problems.   This needs to be revisited with MDE. Finally, since Maryland cannot compel Pennsylvania to help address problems with the Conowingo Dam, we must find a strong partnership with Exelon to do so.","This year's legislature made great strides towards creating a ""back-stop"" with a reinsurance program in order to reduce risk to insurers so more people will have health insurance coverage. We must continue to examine ways to stabilize the individual market and to provide appropriate health care insurance and services.  I support efforts to provide health care services as part of the community school initiative.  Bringing health care directly into the communities would broaden access to populations where there are few providers. Similarly, the struggle to increase the number of health care providers in remote parts of the state must remain a priority by increasing incentives for doctors, nurses and others and financial support for those who go into underserved areas.","The state has an obligation to work with Baltimore City to address violence. Violence in the city is destructive to families, communities and the surrounding jurisdictions. Violent crime is due to many underlying causes that must be part of the state's efforts to help Baltimore. However, this is not only Baltimore's problem.  Long term solutions include more job opportunities, greater emphasis on early childhood education, after-school and summertime programs for learning, skills development and to provide nutrition. Drugs fuel much of the crime, so efforts are needed to provide more drug treatment services and facilities. The state needs to seriously examine the criminalization of drugs and how drug related crimes are addressed. The proposed Task Force to examine what occurred with the Gun Trace Task Force is also an important step to restore confidence in the police. We also need to have stronger sentences for those who repeatedly commit violent crimes.","Maryland's economy is growing.  With the growth of cybersecurity, greater investments in new technologies and new economic developments such as Trade Point Atlantic and Port Covington, there are new opportunities for family supporting jobs. The state needs to continue its commitment bringing industry and educational institutions together to prepare workers for the jobs of today and tomorrow.  Community colleges are vital to this effort and lower cost, or free tuition, must be part of the solution. The state needs to strengthen the incentives and benefits available to promote and support small businesses as part of community revitalization.  This includes areas of Baltimore City and County as well as small towns throughout Maryland. Vast improvements are needed in our transit/transportation network to enable more people getting to jobs more easily.","I would support the use of an independent and non-partisan body to draw district maps depending on how the membership is chosen. It is not clear to me, based on the structures of the commissions in other states, how a commission can be established that is independent of politics.  I believe the next General Assembly should address the manner in which electoral boundaries are determined.",I do not have an answer to this question at this time.  It is not an issue with which I am very familiar and would need to do more research.,"I believe the legislature has taken some very important steps to address the growing opioid crisis. We have committed more funding for treatment and intervention, expanded the hotline for those in crisis who want help, directed prescribers to discuss the risks and benefits of opioids and are working to expand communications and to work with local governments to identify and build upon best practices. We have increased the criminal penalty for those trafficking in volumes of fentanyl.  We need to fund additional research to find alternatives to treating chronic pain.  Employees in our schools and other government agencies, where there is interaction with the public, should also be better educated about the signs and symptoms of addiction so that actions can be taken before there are overdoses.  We should work to improve the training and education of physicians and other health care who prescribe medications so that correct dosages are provided to patients. I would support a substantial expansion of treatment services and facilities.","The state has to be involved in addressing income inequality.  The legislature has set a minimum wage, providing earned sick leave and expanding the EITC, for instance. We have funded funds to eliminate blight and to address food deserts. Economic disparities, and the divide between those with wealth and those without, have grown in Maryland.  The multiple issues required varied approaches. Additional support is needed in schools where there is a large percentage of students who receive free and reduced meals.  Nutritional assistance is essential for students to learn. Their poverty reflects the communities where they live.  Emphasis on job preparedness and job opportunities should be focused in those communities as well.  Attention to health risks and health care should also be focused.  The state's Sustainable Communities program creates a structure for focusing and directing multiple resources to communities. It could be a base for a strategy to tackle income inequality.","The state has improved its open meetings laws and now requires all agency and Boards to have training in the law.  The state established an ombudsman as well to provide assistance.  It is time for the legislature and the Executive Branch to provide more information for the public. Public hearings in both branches should accommodate electronic, remote sign-ins for those who want to testify as well as for the acceptance of testimony. Agency meetings need to be identified on the websites and minutes retained for public access.  While some legislative sub-committees are open, all of them should be. Live streaming of delegation meetings should also become the norm.  It is time to revisit the Public Information Act standards to better clarify when documents should be disclosed and address the cost of disclosure for the providing documents.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

,YES,state-house,16,Marc Lande,Lande,11/14/1973,Chevy Chase,Democratic,Montgomery County,,profile.php?id=100008143119512,landemarc1,,"Guilford College, BA Anthropology Peace and Justice Minor, 1995 Bethesda Chevy Chase High School, Diploma, 1991 Montgomery College, Certified Nursing Assistant, 2010",Journalist Certified Nursing Assistant,"I agree with the Commission recommendations towards low income school districts, pre-K programs, the literacy programs, teacher outreach, career and technical programs.  Much needs to be done in terms of funding.   I would love to see a sales or property tax that will help fund programs.   A top priority of mine is ensuring every family in the state of Maryland has the ability to get their child or children to an early childhood daycare program.   Another priority which I believe I am the only candidate in  Maryland calling for is conflict resolution classes k to 12th grade.  I fault the Kiran's Commission failure to adequately address this issue.","Dedicated funding in the Metro development is good for Metro. However, much more must be done by the Federal government to terms of funding the Metro system. Washington DC is the nation's capital.  Our federal government should be tackling the major funding issues confronting Metro.",No.,n/a,"More has to be done by the federal government to ensure every American get the best, most affordable health care anywhere on this planet.  However, the state of Maryland can help ensure that Marylanders get the best of possible services through increasing taxes.",I feel we should lead the country in gun control.  We have the ability to place iPhone technology in every gun in Maryland. I am in favor of this technology to track stolen guns.  We have the ability to place trigger locks  on every gun so that they do not fire in schools. I am in favor of this and leading the country towards more favorable gun control.  We have the ability to require every new gun sale comes with a fingerprint lock.  Every gun in Maryland should be sold with this technology. Furthermore why do we not have conflict resolution classes for every Marylander k-12?  It starts with the children.  Teaching students ways to control their angry can be a means to reducing crime. These solutions will help crime in Baltimore.,"We should have higher research development credits to green and health care industries.  As a state, we should be looking to lead the green evolution.  Even if this means a much higher tax rate for the 1% of the tax bracket,I whole heartedly agreed.  I feel big government focused around green and health technologies and a safer community will attract investment worldwide to this great state.",I am a 100% against 'Republican' gerrymandering. Yes.,"I am a firm believer in Black Lives Matter and as I say, Blue Lives Matter (Police Officers). I do not believe that you have to choose a side.   I do not believe that the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights places inadequate protections in police officers hands. I have heard of no cases in the state of Maryland where a police officer was protected unfairly because of this law.  At the same time, I am fearful that a police officer could avoid prosecution because he is simply a police officer.  So we need cameras for every police officer and we need judges who will be lent to the fears confronting African Americans especially when being stopped for traffic violations.  In this country, there have been innocent people shot down by law enforcement.  In general, there are good law abiding citizens and good law abiding cops.  Unfortunately, I detest that many African Americans fear whenever confronted by a police officer.  We must be working towards social political and economic justice (or equality) in the state of Maryland.  On this issue, social justice is of the utmost importance for us to move forward as a state.",I will support a bill to address this crisis.,"I feel the 1%in this country have too much wealth and the lowest 5% have it too hard.  We need big government initiatives that alleviate the suffering for the lower and middle classes. But we should not simply throw money at problems.  From conflict resolution classes,  early education daycare, gun control, affordable health care and real environmental regulations, our state can lead this nation to an equitable community.","I do believe that all open meetings should be open not closed as loopholes have done.  I would listen to legislation towards greater transparency for PIA.  I do believe that solutions for transparency will be hard to find.  Updating computer systems and thus, making PIAs much more affordable, is a solution that is viable for the state of Maryland. I will support legislation regarding greater transparency.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

I agree with some of the findings of the Kirwan Commission, but disagree with others.  I think there are multiple ways to improve education in Maryland.  Each year the school system requests and receives additional funding.  I think we need to evaluate the rate of return on the dollars and make sure the dollars are going into the classroom for students and teachers.  I also believe we need to make sure students who are on the college prep path have the classes needed to be successful in college and make sure schools are offering the right amount of job training and other vocational programs for students who do not plan to pursue college.","I drive the Baltimore Beltway and I-95 daily and I believe we need to look at all matters of transportation in the region.  Again, I go back to are state taxpayers getting a worthy rate of return on the public transportation needs in the region, particularly light rail.   The current Administration in Annapolis has worked to improve bus routes in the region and this is a step in the right direction.","No, I do not support legalized marijuana.","The Chesapeake Bay is one of the state's greatest natural resources and draws people from all over the region to our state to enjoy. Many in our State rely on the Bay for their livelihood, while others simply enjoy its recreational opportunities.   I am committed to making sure the Bay is safe for all Marylanders and others to enjoy.  The state has made significant progress over the last twenty years cleaning up the Bay and I support efforts to maintain the health of the Bay.",Health care is too costly. I'm focused on lowering the price of insurance premiums for hard working families.  The costs associated with Obamacare are not sustainable to Maryland taxpayers and my priority is lowering the cost for Marylanders so they can afford the care they need.,"The leaders of the City of Baltimore must get tough on criminals.  It is the murder capital of the country.  That is not a statistic anyone wants Maryland to be known for.  All levels of law enforcement must work together to make the streets of Baltimore safer.  We cannot ignore the impact that the opioid epidemic is having in our city and its correlation to higher crime.  Instead of talking about stricter gun laws, let's try focusing on enforcing some of the ones we have on the books.","The business climate is improving but there is still much to be done in order to make the business climate stronger in the state.  For too long, leaders in Annapolis have made it difficult with burdensome overregulation and increased taxes/fees.  Small businesses are the economic engine in my district and the state.  We need to remove barriers to help businesses grow and thrive.  The legislature continues to be of the mindset that big businesses drive the economy,  but it really is small businesses. My priority is repealing unnecessary taxes/fees and regulations so small business owners can thrive, not just survive.",Yes,"Our men and women who work everyday to keep Marylanders safe and arrest criminals need to know we support them.  I believe the Law Enforcement Bill of Rights is a step in the right direction.  It does not protect law enforcement officers who commit crimes from prosecution, like the ones people read about in Baltimore City.",First get tougher on the drug dealers and producers.  Increase the penalty for jail and fines for these individuals who are dealing death in our communities.  This crisis knows no geographic or socioeconomic bounds.  We also must teach children earlier about the harmful repercussions with opioid use.,"The state should not be telling its citizens where they need to live or work.

I think the emphasis on high-achieving students is less urgent, given that they have more options for earning community college credit either through dual enrollment or new education models like the Middle College Program in Prince George's County where students earn their high school diploma and an associate's degree concurrently. I fully support the emphasis on higher teacher pay and career and technical education for non-college bound students. There is sufficient emphasis and preparation for college-bound students but too few programs to promote career readiness for IT, green jobs and high end manufacturing, among other fields that offer high wages. I would be open to funding reforms that accelerate universal pre-K and funnel more money to schools in low-income areas.  I fully support the constitutional amendment creating a lockbox for casino monies to fund education on top of the current state commitment but I am unsure what other options there may be for raising the estimated $1.9 billion that the National Center for Education and the Economy said the state should be spending on public schools. (The recommendation is actually for an additional $2.9 billion but $1.9 billion would come from the state and the remainder from the counties.)","No, Maryland's spending is completely imbalanced when it comes to roads and transit. The FY 2019 capital improvement program (CIP) budget for the State Highway Administration is $1.45 billion, the largest share of the transportation CIP. By comparison, the CIP budget for the MD Transit Administration is $811 million for MARC Camden, Brunswick and Penn lines; Baltimore light rail;  bus procurement including Kirk bus facility replacement; Purple Line transit construction in Montgomery and Pr. George's counties; Metro rail vehicle replacement; and capital assistance for locally owned transit systems. I believe the state has enough for its transportation needs, but we must make smarter investments, especially with respect to transit but also improved pedestrian and bike paths to induce people to get out of their cars.  Governor Hogan's reduction in ICC and Chesapeake Bay Bridge tolls (Your Summer Vacation Just Got Cheaper) was a political gimmick. We all still pay for maintenance of Maryland's 17,143 lane miles, whether it comes out of our vacation budget, commuting costs or income taxes. The $135 million BaltimoreLink bus rerouting, bus only lanes and traffic light sensors to extend green lights has improved reliability but ridership is flat, according to a Nov. 14, 2017, article in the Sun. I believe Baltimore residents still need the Red Line for more efficient East-West commuting and leisure travel between Baltimore County (West) and Baltimore City (East). With the Red Line's 2030 daily ridership projection of 54,000 people, bus service alone, however efficient, will not be sufficient.","No. I have a family member whose son became addicted to marijuana. He was stopped by police at least twice for driving under the influence. He was found on another occasion late at night in a park a few miles from home, disoriented and unable to find his way. Police waited while his parents came to pick him up and at that point they insisted he seek treatment. Fortunately, he recognized he had a problem and entered a rehabilitation program voluntarily. Two years later, he is clean, holding down a job and doing well.  Unlike with alcohol, there is no chemical test to determine the level of impairment of someone under the influence of marijuana; however, a Highway Loss Data Institute study shows in Colorado, Oregon and Washington where recreational marijuana is legal, collision claims are 3% higher than would be expected without legalization. After alcohol, marijuana is the drug most often found in the blood of drivers involved in crashes, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, as reported in a Jan. 1. 2018 article in USA Today.","Maryland must continue its partnership with the five states (DE, NY, PA, VA and WV) and the District of Columbia that share the Chesapeake Bay watershed to control development, limit deforestation and reduce runoff of stormwater, pesticides and other pollutants that threaten the Bay.  The watershed is home to more than 18 million people and its health is tied to human health and economic stability. Maryland must have strong environmental statutes and robust enforcement. This includes its Tree Conservation Law requiring 1:1 replacement when developers cut down trees, tight restrictions on runoff from agricultural operations including pesticides and animal fecal matter,  and regular water quality testing for those operations.  If warranted, the state cannot hesitate to impose fishing and harvesting restrictions for fin fish, crabs, oysters and clams that not only contribute significantly to Maryland's economy but are critical to the Bay's complex ecosystem.","I am a supporter of the concept of Medicare for All but we need a formula for funding it. The state could certainly negotiate lower prescription drug rates for Maryland's 6 million residents, but a single payer health care system would probably have to involve a combination of taxes and an employer premium. MD gubernatorial candidate Ben Jealous has asserted that a combination of state taxes to finance a single payer system would still be less than insurance premiums under the current employment based system of coverage.","The state could provide more financial support to Baltimore City to reduce violent crime through more grants and technical assistance from the Governor's Office of Crime Control & Prevention. These should focus on community policing, family violence prevention, and Cease Fire grants to reduce gun violence. Baltimore City should also receive state money for social services programs in its school system,  community and senior centers to address family stresses such as substance abuse, underemployment and other factors that precipitate violence.","I think  Maryland's business climate is healthy. I agree with the use of some economic incentives for business relocation to Maryland or to prevent Maryland-based employers from leaving the state. However, the state must have a balanced approach and cannot give away the store. Governor Hogan's $5 billion plan to entice Amazon's HQ2 project is excessive. Either tax breaks or road and infrastructure improvements might be acceptable, but I do not believe providing both is necessary or justifiable.",Yes. I think it is embarrassing and indefensible that Maryland is the most gerrymandered state in the country and that its congressional map is under review by the United States Supreme Court.,"The most controversial aspect of LEOBR is the 10 days a police officer has to obtain legal representation in a disciplinary case.  I think there is a legitimate argument that 10 days is excessive.  My understanding is that the 10 days is for the officer, not the agency, and if the officer does not have representation within the 10 days, he or she gives up the right to representation and can be compelled to answer questions. If the officer refuses, he or she can be terminated. However, the reality is that this never seems to happen. I could support shortening the 10-day period but this alone would not achieve greater balance between safeguards for police and the public they are sworn to protect.","The opioid crisis needs a multi-pronged approach starting with laws restricting  how pain killers are prescribed and dispensed by health care providers and pharmacists. The controls that are in place for medical marijuana should be considered and where appropriate can be replicated for opioid prescriptions. These include approved medical conditions for receiving prescriptions, the issuance of medical ID cards for those who are approved, limits on possession and a state registry that is updated daily when prescriptions are filled. Physicians need to be retrained on pain management alternatives to opioids and all law enforcement agencies and other non-medical personnel need training in and access to Naloxone to reverse overdoses.","I am a strong supporter of a statewide $15/hr. minimum wage, phased in but with an inflation index so that wage hikes in the future are automatic to keep up with the increased cost of living. In many areas of the state, the greatest single expense for families is the cost of housing. Too many people are housing insecure, meaning they pay 30 percent or more for rent or their mortgage. This exacerbates income inequality and is a constant economic threat to those families and individuals who live on the margins. The state has an Affordable Housing Trust Fund that is considered efficient; however, it could leverage public and private monies to grow the fund and provide support to lower income families to access affordable units.","On their face, those laws are powerful tools to ensure citizens' ability to monitor government. However, there are ways around open meetings; the use of executive session is one way and there is not always sound legal justification for conducting government business in executive session. Citizen and media monitoring of the use of executive session is critical. Also, when the media, citizens and other stakeholders request various government communications, including meeting minutes, correspondence and other public records, Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) officers must be responsive and provide the requested documents in a timely fashion. As a former journalist, I hear myriad complaints about foot dragging by government officials charged with responding to FOIA requests, which is unacceptable.  I frequently remind government officials that the free flow of information and a free press is what protects us from tyranny.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

I am currently a member of the Maryland House of Delegates where I serve on the House Environment & Transportation Committee.   Before becoming Delegate, I devoted almost 20 years working around the world working on public health programs. My work included conducting clinical and operations research, scaling up health innovations, and strengthening health policies in Asia, Africa, the Caribbean. I am fluent in French, and skilled in Mandarin, Zarma and Haitian Creole.  I began my international health career as a Peace Corps Volunteer in Niger, where I worked in a remote Maternal & Child Health clinic. After, I worked for several years at other international organizations, such as the World Bank, UNICEF and Family Health International. After coming home, I worked at Johns Hopkins University for a decade managing international clinical trials, operations research studies and health programs. Most recently, I served as Special Assistant at the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange, where I helped expand access to affordable, quality health insurance coverage to over 1 million Marylanders.","Yes, I support the commission and will work to ensure that all proposed funding reforms are followed. The nine building blocks laid out in the Commission's initial report provide a robust framework for reforming our public education system. For Baltimore and Maryland's students to succeed in a 21st century economy, it is imperative that we create a world class education system across our state. We face daunting challenges, including a growing number of jobs requiring some level of post-secondary education, as well as an increasing percentage of low skilled jobs which are in danger of automation. If Maryland's economy is to continue thriving, we must invest in our public education so students are not left behind.  Creating an education lockbox to ensure tax dollars from casino revenue supplement and not supplant education funding is an important first step, but more action will be required. I commit to helping to lead the fight for an equitable funding formula so those students who are most in need of additional wrap around services and after school programming receive those opportunities. I will also fight to make sure our teachers feel valued and remain in the classroom. Too many teachers fill the roles well beyond the scope of their jobs and work hours extended past those in their contracts with no additional pay. The Kirwan Commission presents a pivotal opportunity to restructure our state's education system and funding formula, a moment we must seize.","Maryland's transportation spending is not appropriately balanced between roads and transit - we can do more to support accessible and reliable forms of public transportation. The state has the resources to meet its transportation needs, but we must prioritize legislation that makes it easy and pleasant for people to get out of their cars and multimodal transportation.  Public transit is an equity issue. If people can't get to work on time, we will continue patterns of systemic oppression by denying some people access to opportunities, while others continue to thrive. That is why in 2011, I founded Red Line Now PAC, the first grassroots, volunteer-run political organization to demand transit investment in Baltimore's history. In the lead up to the 2013 legislative session, Red Line Now PAC mobilized almost 1000 residents along the project corridor from East to West and lobbied most every city and state elected official. I helped to create the first ever regional transit alliance -- the Get Maryland Moving coalition -- to bring together Red Line and Purple Line advocates to fight for the 2013 Transportation funding bill.   I was devastated by Governor Hogan's reckless decision to cancel the Red Line project, but I am committed to working to ensure people in the Baltimore region have access to reliable and efficient public transit. This session, I introduced and supported bills to improve bus service quality and reliability, reduce car dependency, and secure more public transit funding including $178 million dedicated to Baltimore.	 ","Yes, on the condition that Maryland first carefully evaluate best practices and policies from other states so as to ensure that any legalization process is carried out in a rational, just and equitable fashion. It would be instructive to also first evaluate lessons learned from Maryland's efforts to introduce medical marijuana and we just passed the bill to do so this session.   The process was fraught and the biggest problem was ensuring that minorities and women were given equal opportunity to get in on the ground floor of this brand new industry. Unfortunately, it was not done properly, and a great deal of time, good will, and momentum were lost.   We must avoid the exclusionary practices that gave preferential treatment to primarily wealthy white folks; we saw this happen with the legalization of medical marijuana and must end the practices that limit access to business opportunities for women and minorities. I also believe it is worth exploring options for legalizing recreational marijuana, because revenues from a regulated market could be used to fund important public needs, such as fulfilling the recommendations of the Kirwin Commission.","Maryland has a long track record of efforts to restore and protect the health of the Chesapeake Bay. Nutrient reduction programs for the agriculture sector, septic tank regulation, oyster sanctuaries, and other initiatives have contributed to water quality improvements. However, there is still work to do. Maryland has the ability to take significant actions, no matter what the federal government does, or does not do. We should continue to study and improve our current efforts to reduce nutrient and sewage runoff. In addition, Baltimore City and Maryland should double down on desultory efforts to repair Baltimore city's sewage system problems -- demanded by a federal consent decree.","The greatest lift must be at the federal level, because federal dollars are needed to undergird health insurance markets in every state. Until we have a rational person in the White House, and a US Congress that is not controlled  by corporate interests, we will struggle to protect and expand health care at the state level. I believe that change will come at the national level, but until then there are a few things we can do at state level -- many of which we are already doing.   Maryland is at the forefront in pursuing innovative ways to protect our citizens' health care from those currently running the federal government.   We just passed an  omnibus bill that will temporarily tamp down significant increases in health insurance premiums. This bill authorizes the state to secure a federal 1332 waiver, which will enable Maryland to use federal funds to create a reinsurance program and fund the program using a fee charged to insurance companies operating in Maryland. The fund will raise $380 million this year and keep premiums down for everyday working people.   Finally, this omnibus bill allows us study long term solutions to protect and expand health coverage, such as my Basic Health Plan. That bill, which I introduced, was folded into and passed as part of the larger omnibus health bill.","As a public health expert, I know that violent crime is not only a criminal justice issue, but a public health one. We must work to interrupt and prevent violence before it escalates, which is why I was proud of the General Assembly's work in the 2018 Legislative Session. The $11.7 million we secured for evidence based violence prevention programs like Safe Streets will make tangible impacts across Baltimore, like we are already seeing in areas like Cherry Hill and McElderry Park, both in District 46.  Great communities are safe communities. This fact really hit home when I moved to my block 18 years ago. At that time, half the houses were vacant and drug dealers operated openly. I joined with my neighbors to build a healthier, safer neighborhood through a systematic community building process called community greening. This process involves mobilizing residents to participate in improving the neighborhood thru tree planting, cleaning, and other participatory activities. It is now well documented that green streets are safer. Funding from the Chesapeake Bay Trust - some state funded - made our grassroots efforts possible.    While we must work to prevent violence through participatory, public health approaches, we must also hold repeat violent offenders accountable. A balanced approach of prevention and diversion, while also enacting more stringent consequences will prove to be most effective in the long run. The Justice Reinvestment Act's approach to reforming our justice system towards treating those with addiction and targeting violent offenders is the right model.","One of the most effective ways to stimulate job creation is to build infrastructure, particularly modern transit. This includes fixed rail, as well as bike amenities. Building modern transit infrastructure returns $4 for every dollar invested; this is why it was an absolute economic crime and civil rights disgrace when Governor Hogan cancelled the Red Line light rail project. That decision robbed Baltimore of 10,000 jobs and billions of dollars in economic activity over the coming decades. There is no other investment that would offer greater returns. Damage is done in that regard, but it is not too late to revive the State Center project, which Governor Hogan also has derailed. It is disgraceful that he has, at every turn, blocked the economic catalysts that would have transformed Baltimore, while then claiming that the money spent on Baltimore has made no difference.   I advocate for robust infrastructure investment. Construction and operation of transit create good jobs, and the return on investment pays off: companies want to invest in cities with strong transit networks, and it attracts talented and educated individuals. Better transit ensures that working people already living in Baltimore can reliably access job opportunities. According to a recent Regional Development Study, the average commute time in Central Maryland, which includes Baltimore, is 90 minutes each way. This statistic is associated with high unemployment and lower quality of life. If we improve our transit network we will increase equity, enabling folks to get to work faster and more reliably.","Yes, absolutely. Districts must be drawn in a fair and impartial manner. However, in order to do so, we must have a complete, unbiased and transparent census. At this time, it is not clear that the census will be implemented as it should be. I am not confident that the current Presidential Administration will approach this issue with the required impartiality.","The current Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights (LEOBR) does not currently balance protections for police and the public, largely due to specific provisions. Both processes regarding filing complaints against officers for misconduct, or excessive force are skewed towards favoring law enforcement if people are unable to file their complaints in time. The lack of immediate oversight after a complaint is filed also provides an advantage to law enforcement officers, which the public does not enjoy.  Restoring trust between law enforcement and the public is critical to building safe neighborhoods. That's why I was proud to help pass legislation sponsored by Senator Ferguson and Delegate McCray to create an independent commission to investigate the conditions which led to the Gun Trace Task Force. This commission will help to objectively review departmental policies and any necessary reforms which can prevent additional issues like with the GTTF in the future.","The opioid crisis is a public health issue, not a criminal issue that can be addressed through policing and the justice system. Therefore, we must treat it as a public health epidemic and continue to expand evidence-based treatment while providing more social support systems. We must address the drug supply issue both in terms of formal prescriptions by medical professionals and through helping drug users identify products contaminated by fentanyl, the deadly pain medication causing so many overdoses. Users are often unaware that the drugs they purchase may contain fentanyl. As a result, we just passed legislation that will decriminalize drug testing kits. Now legal, users can test their product and avoid poisoning themselves.","In order to address income inequality we have to look at measures that improve access to resources, equitably, for all Marylanders. To do so, we must increase support for unions, build large scale transit infrastructure to ensure people can reach jobs reliably and on time, improve the quality of education, and make it more affordable and accessible to expand health care coverage.","While we've seen an improvement Marylanders' ability to exercise oversight of the government, we still have a long way to go. Maryland's Open Data Policy, passed in 2014, was one step toward increased transparency, but we must expand on this, and ensure more documents and materials are, by default, open and available to the public. We can achieve this through more robust investments in information technology, an area in which Maryland falls behind relative to other states. We should also invest in public broadband in our city and large population centers. We must also make the effort to invest and expand internet access to rural areas as well. While we have these policies in place, we must also ensure that open data policies are being met by government agencies.  I also support efforts to democratize access to public data, and make it easier for citizens, policy makers, state agencies and elected officials to talk to each other, in real time. There are strategies, such as design thinking, that we could put to broad use; I think its worth looking into, because at this point, communication between the public and agencies/electeds isn't as transparent and easy as it should be.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

,YES,state-house,3A,Karen Lewis Young,Lewis Young,6/21/1951,Frederick,Democratic,Frederick County,http://www.karenlewisyoungfordelegate.com,klewisyoung,kmlcmky,http://surveygizmoresponseuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/fileuploads/296249/4297291/44-f7f2f5731f6a041150cea0f8cb0f4acd_IMG_3038.jpg,BA History-Franklin &Marshall College MA American History-Columbia University MBA- Columbia University,30 years of  experience in Banking and Financial Services Branch Management and Marketing,"I agree with the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education. There are a variety of funding sources available such as the lockbox legislation on gambling revenues just passed in the General Assembly ($500 million) and reforms such as closing corporate tax loopholes. In addition, should recreational marijuana move forward, those revenues should go to health care and education.","Depending upon where you reside, and how you prefer to travel, you might have a different perspective about the current balance between roads and transit spending. Also, the ratio that we have today, is probably not ideal for the future. As we address issues of affordability, efficiency, and environmental impact, we may need to shift more focus towards transit. It is clear that we are not adequately funding either today. I believe that some improvements were made during the past legislative session in that funding was allocated towards Metro and legislation was enacted to increase the return of state highway user revenues to local jurisdictions. I do not believe that the Baltimore region is adequately served by transit and other options need to be explored. Perhaps, light rail might be a more affordable alternative to the Red Line.","Ultimately, I believe that this will pass. Public opinion is now in favor of recreational marijuana and that support increases annually.  I would anticipate that it will be legalized within the next five years.  Unfortunately, insufficient research has been done on the long-term effects of marijuana usage. The Federal Government should step up research efforts to better understand health outcomes as well as marijuana's potential to lead to other drug usage. We can learn a lot from other states that have legalized marijuana and avoid many of their mistakes. I believe that marijuana is less harmful than alcohol and it certainly is not as addictive or dangerous as opioids.","We need to increase our efforts to maintain the commitment of the federal government in restoring the Chesapeake Bay. It is a major natural resource and economic driver in our state. In addition, we should ensure the quality of the rivers and streams that feed into the Chesapeake so that the cycle of pollution is broken. Maryland must strengthen partnerships with other states so that neighboring states' waterways do not continue to contaminate the Chesapeake. We must also continue our efforts to ensure that polluted runoff containing sediment and waste products is not entering the Chesapeake or any waterways that run into it.","Ultimately, I am becoming increasingly convinced that the single-payer model may be the only real viable option for accessibility and affordability. However, a task of this enormity can only occur effectively with a well-managed transition. At this point in time, we are seriously challenged with access, affordability, and quality. The MD General Assembly continuously looks at scope of practice issues with the goal of increasing access and affordability. Also, we are looking to expand access in the rural areas. Incentivizing physicians and other providers to locate in rural areas has remained a challenge. A bill that I sponsored (HB1132-Access to Local Heath Departments) will require insurance providers to cover costs incurred at local health departments. This will be particularly beneficial in rural areas. Affordability has been challenged by the federal undermining of the Affordable Care Act. Without the individual mandate, this risk pool is smaller, thus increasing costs for those who want or need to have health insurance. MD has taken steps to maintain reinsurance in order to motivate providers to continue subsidies for the most challenged among us. Also, a fee has been instituted among insurers, who received federal tax cuts. This revenue will be applied towards sustaining the individual market and holding down rate increases. Some consolidation of the plan options might be necessary to hold costs down. Finally, we still have major work to do to ensure quality. Much more needs to be done to tie outcomes and patient satisfaction to payments and subsidies.","The state needs to take on a greater role in addressing violent crime in Baltimore. Violence stems from a combination of poverty, family instability, and drug abuse. In addition, racist housing policies and bad, or non-existent policing exacerbates the opportunities for violence. Inadequate resources, recruitment, and training of police officers further allows for a climate of violence. According to a recent article in the Economist, ""Where murderers operate with a sense of impunity, they are likely to commit more murders."" Programs such as ""Safe Streets"" appear to be having some positive results. A combination of former criminals turned social workers, community leaders, and streetwise locals have been somewhat effective at community  intervention. Most Safe Street workers agree that the City needs four things: 1) better schools, 2) better preparation for jobs, 3) fewer prescription drugs, and 4) more and better policing. The state can play a major role in supporting all of these goals.","According to the state's website, ""Maryland's economy continues to outperform the country as a whole. Information technology, telecommunications, and aerospace defense are leading forces behind Maryland's economic growth. In the biotechnology area, Maryland is a noted leader and is at the center in the mapping of the human genome and commercial applications that result from its research. Maryland continues to invest in education in order to prepare the State for growth in sectors requiring highly educated workers. In the nation, Maryland ranks first in the percentage of professional and technical workers and is poised to gain both defense and non defense contracts for medical research, aircraft development, and security. As of 2/16/18, Maryland still retains its AAA bond rating,. It is one of only eleven states to achieve this highest award. In 2017, U.S. News and World Report ranked Maryland no. 8 in their ""Best States"" list, which ranks each state based on seven categories: crime & corrections, economy, education, government, healthcare, infrastructure and opportunity."" Venture capital investment in Maryland has doubled in the past year. Nevertheless, there are still too many people being left behind. We need stronger policies for ensuring better access to quality education for K-12. We also need to continue our work on college and technical training affordability. Finally, tax incentives should be more closely tied to and evaluated on their ability and success in fostering the creation of more family-supporting jobs.","I do support the creation of a non-partisan, independent body to draw legislative and congressional district maps after each census. Since this is a national issue, however, I would like to see a national solution. At a minimum, there should be regional agreements to address this challenge is a consistent manner. Otherwise, this effort will remain a partisan battle led by each individual state party that is not in power.","In the summer of 2016, a task force came up with 23 recommendations to hold police more accountable. Numerous reports of police brutality in Maryland, as well as the rest of the country, caused our Judiciary Committee to strike a better balance between protections for police and the public. Some of the issues debated included the makeup of a three-member discipline hearing board,  shortening the time an officer has to retain a lawyer, extending the time that a resident has to file a complaint, a proposal to require psychological testing for officers every three years, creating an independent Maryland Police Training and Standards Commission, and allowing anonymous complaints against officers. These recommendations were highly contentious. While we certainly want to respect our law enforcement officers who put their lives on the line, there is no doubt that vast improvements need to be made against discrimination and brutality. I certainly support better training and sensitivity to diverse cultural mores. Community policing practices will gain better trust and respect as well as stronger communications and information. The public needs to feel that when law enforcement over steps their protocols, they will be held accountable. Public participation is necessary in the trial board. While I understand the concept of, ""You have to walk in their shoes in order to understand their challenges,"" the public voice is needed in order to achieve buy-in.","Addressing the opioid crisis requires a multi-faceted approach. Education is the first step so that our constituents are aware of the dangers and warning signs of addiction. We need to expand K-12 prevention programs.  More education is needed for the prescriber community as well since decades of overprescribing has helped fuel this crisis. Education will assist in Prevention, which is the second most important step. The Medical Community and Legislators have taken many steps to ensure more reasonable standards and guidelines in prescribing, including limitations and proper disposal. Treatment is another major component of dealing with the opioid crisis and one that we are falling short on. There are simply not enough treatment beds and too many people are waiting weeks, if not months, for treatment. When beds are available, they are not always affordable or accessible. Finally, we must do a better job of dealing with stigma. Addiction is frequently closely associated with behavioral health challenges. This should be treated like any other health issue and patients should not be ashamed to seek help and support.","Income inequality has risen in every state since the 1970s and in many states is up to the post-Great Recession era. In 24 states, the top 1 percent captured at least half of all income growth between between 2009 and 2013, and in 15 of those states, the top 1 percent captured all income growth. According to the Economic Policy Institute, the average annual income of the top 1% in Maryland is $1,024,110. The top 1% takes home 14.5% of all of the income in Maryland.The average income of everyone else is $60,172. The top1% makes 17 times more than the bottom 99%. Maryland ranks #37 of the 50 states in income inequality. There are several solutions that have been offered to address this situation. Some of them are: promote trade in highly- skilled professions, make it easier to start and join unions, reform intellectual property law (especially for medicine), relax licensing rules, ease up on zoning restrictions, increase transfers, and the most important solution is to fund early childhood education.","There has been much improvement to the state's Public Information Act (PIA) and open meeting laws but more improvements are possible. In 2015, the General Assembly (GA) amended the PIA to reform the process by which PIA responses are issued and reviewed. At the same time the GA also directed the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) to report to the Governor and General Assembly on a number of issues relating to the implementation of the PIA, with an interim report due at the end of 2016 and a final report due at the end of 2017. Those eight recommendations improve accessibility, efficiency and objectivity.  The Open Meetings Compliance Board, under the OAG, provides an annual report on its activities to the GA.  The report issued during 9/17 documents the number and nature of complaints received. However, I believe that there is insufficient attention provided to recommendations for corrective action. I believe that one of the greatest challenges of the PIA is to be able to deal with obsessive or nuisance requests but still be responsive to the public's need for information and oversight. The Open Meetings Compliance Board has a similar balancing challenge in that they need to guarantee public observation while protecting sensitive personnel and contract negotiation issues. While there is a process for qualifying for closed meetings, the criteria could be communicated better. Also, wherever it is feasible to live stream meetings, that should occur.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

,YES,state-house,46,Brooke Elizabeth Lierman,Lierman,2/14/1979,Baltimore,Democratic,Baltimore City,http://www.brookelierman.com,brookeliermanfordelegate,belbaltimore,http://surveygizmoresponseuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/fileuploads/296249/4297291/179-c707203eb451c88463f9feec2f9d14c0_Brooke-Lierman-Headshot_%282%29_%282%29.jpg,"I graduated from Dartmouth College (A.B., '01) and the University of Texas School of Law (J.D. '08).","I currently practice a variety of civil rights law at Brown, Goldstein & Levy LLP in Baltimore City, including representing low-wage workers, individuals with disabilities, and more. After college, I worked as an AmeriCorps VISTA for one year and then worked as an organizer and field director on several national federal campaigns, including for the late Sen. Paul Wellstone (2002). I also spent one year working at the Center for American Progress in Washington, D.C. I serve on the Advisory Board for the Downtown Baltimore Family Alliance, and on the Boards  of Directors for the Baltimore Museum of Art and Advocates for Children & Youth.","Yes, wholeheartedly. I have been actively involved in reviewing the Kirwan Commission's work and progress, and was a lead co-sponsor of its initial legislation this year. Ensuring that the Kirwan Commission's recommendations translate into a transformative piece of legislation in 2019 and passing that bill will be the most important work of the next term.   The Kirwan Commission's recommendations demonstrate that we know what needs to be done to create a more equitable and effective school system that truly ensures that every Maryland child graduates career- or college-ready. The question next session will be whether we are able to implement and fund those practices. We will need legislators who are champions for students and schools to ensure that the emphasis remains on what is best for Maryland students. Additional state funding will be required to implement the recommendations, and we must be open-minded and creative as we review our state's taxes and fees to address the additional revenue needed. It is not an overstatement to say that Baltimore's future success hinges on achieving a more equitable funding formula and additional resources for our schools.  As the mother of two small children, one of who will be attending a Baltimore City Public School in the fall for Kindergarten, I understand the urgency of addressing the inequity that exists in our school systems. Every year that passes represents a lost opportunity for a child. We must act boldly and thoughtfully next year to create the world-class school system that our kids deserve.","In short, no. Although Maryland has many needs, our failure to create a 21st century public transportation system is one that will hamper our progress for generations if we don't act now. Employers depend on transit options, millennials and seniors often want non-car travel options, and reducing commute time has transformative effects on reducing poverty.  Not only does Maryland not have the resources to meet its transportation needs, it has over-invested in highway and road projects rather than making the transformative investments in public transit that we need. Especially in Central Maryland, we lack the transit service necessary to make the region's jobs accessible to all. Without additional robust transit options, BaltimoreLink cannot serve enough people to end commuting woes. For all these reasons, I have worked over the past four years to highlight the need for creative thinking on transportation issues, and why I will continue to champion bold actions on transportation options if I am re-elected.  After passing legislation to end the farebox recovery mandate last year, this year I championed the MTA amendment to HB372. With passage of that bill, MTA will (1) receive required additional operating and capital dollars for the first time in many years, (2) be required to produce an updated Central Maryland Transit Plan (with input from stakeholders), and (3) develop a comprehensive capital needs assessment. This plan should provide the blueprint we need to rally around a goal for our region. We need legislative leaders to make the plan a reality.","Yes, I support legalizing and regulating marijuana (either through legislation or by referendum). We should learn from the work of other states to avoid some of their mistakes, and learn from the mistakes made during the rollout of medical marijuana in Maryland.  The money gained from regulated marijuana should be dedicated to two or three specific funds, including the Education Trust Fund and funding to expand or pay for health insurance for Marylanders.","As the federal government has retreated from protecting our natural resources, we must step up to fill the void. Maryland's economy, tourism industry, and natural habitats largely rely on government intervention to protect the Bay and its environs. Although we have largely dealt with point source pollution, we have not yet fully resolved our stormwater runoff pollution issues. Moreover, the level of trash – including plastic trash – in the rivers and inlets and even out in the open Bay – shows no signs of abating, and we cannot keep the trash TMDL for the bay without taking action to ban EPS foam and single-use plastic bags (bills that I championed this past term). We must take steps to reduce trash and help contain runoff both from urban areas and from large farms.   Enforcement of our existing laws is also critically important. Recently, the Departments of the Environment and Agriculture have failed to adequately enforce existing laws – refusing entirely to hire enforcement officers and using negotiations where fines and decisive action are needed.  We need active oversight and enforcement from these agencies, as well as a return to smart growth planning by the Department of Planning.    Looking forward, we must implement more comprehensive policies to (1) limit deforestation and increase tree canopies in Baltimore City and elsewhere, (2) clean our state's neighborhoods and waterways of plastic trash, and (3) more aggressively implement existing laws to ensure Marylanders can enjoy clean air and clean water.","Every Marylander should have access to high-quality and affordable health care. Although moving toward a single-payer system may be possible eventually, right now we must (1) shore up the insurance markets and (2) protect our waiver programs. Maryland has long been at the forefront of health insurance innovations, starting with the Medicaid/Medicare Waiver program that allows a state commission to set global prices for hospital services. In 2014, we took the ambitious step of requiring hospitals to improve population health while decreasing admissions. This requirement has saved $500 million in the last few years and has resulted in better population health overall.  We should continue to expand this model and idea of improving population health.   For the non-Medicaid/Medicare population using the Maryland Health Benefits Exchange, we must ensure access to affordable, quality insurance. Because of actions at the federal level, our insurance premiums have exploded. This year the General Assembly passed a reinsurance program to save the individual marketplace by using a new fee paid by the insurance companies. The fix is temporary, however, and we need to explore alternative models to make health insurance affordable for individuals of all ages, as well as small businesses.   Maryland is also home to excellent senior care models, including the PACE program at Johns Hopkins Bayview. Replicating patient-centered, coordinated-care models like this will improve the health and well-being of seniors around the state.","The State is responsible for ensuring the safety of all Marylanders. Based on evidence from other states with lowering rates of urban gun violence, I believe that violence prevention must approach violence like a public-health crisis, and fund programs that are preventative and diversionary. Additionally, for the handful of criminals that repeatedly cause violence and lead gangs, there must be successful prosecutions and consequences.  To prevent violence, this past legislative session I authored and passed important funding legislation (HB432) to ensure that (1) the State is investing major dollars into proven public-health based violence prevention and intervention programs, and (2) the City has the resources necessary to implement the strategies of the Mayor's Office of Criminal Justice and to meet the needs of the State's Attorney. We also passed a bill that will triple the number of Safe Streets programs, ensuring that the success of this program in places like Cherry Hill and McElderry Park can be replicated City-wide.  The General Assembly should continue to monitor and provide resources for efforts like these.   The Executive Branch – including the State Police and the Department of Public Safety and Corrections – must work with City government and our police department to provide information and form strategic partnerships. Moreover, because the Police Department is technically a State agency, State oversight is necessary and important. I worked with Sen. Ferguson to establish the Commission to Restore Trust in Policing, a body charged with reviewing the crimes committed by the Gun Trace Task Force.","Maryland has the highest median income in the country, a highly-educated population, some of the best universities in the country, and a nationally-important port, but we are not nearly meeting our potential in economic growth, and the growth we do see is not evenly shared, leading to high rates of income inequality.   Unlike our most successful peer states, we have no coherent state plan or strategy to develop targeted industries for growth, create partnerships among universities and businesses, or realize the full potential of the transportation and logistics fields associated with the Port of Baltimore. State political leaders should work with business and education leaders to develop pathways to successful careers, relying less on tax incentives and more on easy access to qualified, dependable employees, transportation options, and ready capital. Although we have to be mindful of Maryland's tax rates to remain competitive, tax rates are but one issue in the overall analysis of our state's business climate.   We should use comprehensive studies like the Opportunity Collaborative's Regional Plan for Sustainable Development to create strategies for the state, take advantage of opportunities, and identify impediments to growth. This strategy would require leadership from the Governor and Secretary of Commerce, but would be transformative in laying out a road map for building a more equitable state with access to good-paying jobs and careers. The plans would require investment in targeted areas of our education system and on transportation options, and would create an economic development blueprint for the next 50 years.","Yes, I do.","Baltimore City is facing a crisis of confidence in our police force, and the LEOBR is partly to blame. The LEOBR is partially responsible for disallowing the Commissioner the leeway needed to enforce rules within the Department. The lack of discipline results in false records of overtime, abuses like those listed in the DOJ report, and the egregious behavior of officers in the Gun Trace Task Force. The lack of civilian members on trial boards remains a major impediment to trusting the Baltimore Police Department and its officers, and we should pass legislation to require it.   To be clear, most Baltimore officers perform their jobs honorably and are dedicated to serving and protecting Baltimore residents and families. But the DOJ report and the testimony from the Gun Trace Task Force trials has severely undermined the credibility of the Police, and major steps must be taken to restore the faith. One of those steps was to pass the Commission to Restore Trust in Policing, a bill that I worked on with my colleague Sen. Bill Ferguson. Creating this state-level Commission to examine the origins of the problems at the Task Force, how they were able to persist for so long, and to recommend changes to the Consent Decree Monitoring Team, are essential to helping the City move past this horrible incident.","Our strategies need to be evidence-based and focused on both prevention and treatment. In 2017, I was proud to support the HOPE Act, a comprehensive bill to fight the opioid crisis in our State. The HOPE Act (1) requires increases in funding for community behavioral health services; (2) requires health crisis treatment centers be established, (3) creates a 24/7 crisis hotline, (4) increases naloxone availability, and (5) requires hospitals and jails to develop protocols for discharging individuals treated for or suffering from drug addiction. The state has also supported Baltimore City's opening of a new stabilization center, which will lead the way in preventing overdoses and bringing those who are addicted into contact with medically-trained staff who can help guide them (if they are willing) to resources to treat their addiction.   This year in the budget I supported creation of a local grant program that will award local competitive grants to jurisdictions to expand behavioral health crisis response programs that serve local needs, meet national standards, integrate the delivery of mental health and substance use treatment, and connect individuals to appropriate community-based care upon discharge. We will only overcome the crisis by expanding on-the-ground, comprehensive treatment and this bill and budgeted funding will allow local governments to implement proven and comprehensive strategies tailored for their communities. We must then review what programs are successful and ensure the funding is there to support them.","Maryland has made important investments in education and health care over the years, has many thriving businesses and higher-ed institutions, and now has the highest median income of any state. Unfortunately, the prosperity in our state is not shared by everyone. In Baltimore, the difference in income and life expectancy can change in a matter of blocks; the difference in resource availability between the City and surrounding counties is also stark. We have much more work to do.   We must make investments that will create a more equitable state with shared prosperity in every corner. To do this we must make strategic investments in: 1)	Transportation: As revealed in a long continuing study at Harvard, the single strongest determinant in escaping poverty is commute time. Thus, creating a well-connected and reliable transit system in Central Maryland is essential to reducing poverty. 2)	Eliminate waiting lists for child care support, tax credits, and services for low-income seniors and people with disabilities. 3)	Invest in Public Education, including workforce training: Fully fund the Kirwan Commission recommendations. 4)	Increase availability of affordable housing: MD has high housing costs and more than 8,000 homeless men, women, and children. Increasing the availability of affordable/workforce housing in desirable areas is a must-do. 5)	Create a transportable safety net for the gig economy, including portable benefits so individuals working in the gig economy can save for retirement. 6)	Increase the minimum wage and index it to inflation while also creating more low-cost loan opportunities for small businesses.","The State has made progress on making government more transparent, but there is more that we can do. A strong democracy depends on having open and accessible government. During my first session, the General Assembly passed legislation to update the Public Information Act and Open Meetings Law that included enhancing training, reducing fees for access, and creating an ombudsman with the Office of the Attorney General. This was important work and in the next term, we should build upon it to continue our pursuit of a well-regulated but open and transparent State government.   One of the first things we should do is update the General Assembly's technology. It is still not possible to view online either (1) a list of who testified for/against a bill or (2) the actual written testimony. This absence of information makes it difficult for members of the public to understand which groups or individuals are promoting or trying to defeat legislation. We must also work to ensure that agencies are being held accountable for open meetings and we should create incentives for placing information online in an accessible format, rather than requiring PIA requests.   Cybersecurity threats continue to exist and grow and our technology systems must be updated regularly to ensure that the copious amount of personal data stored by and used by the State government is safe and protected.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

The challenge we face is how to fund its lofty goals. It is important to recognize that each must have a separate strategy, timeline, and a willingness to work outside of the educational structure that existed for decades. It is important for the Governor and the General Assembly to agree on a path forward and publicly declare its plan to accept and fund the policies, programs and timelines necessary to achieve implementation. I am prepared to support the necessary structural and fiscal changes necessary because I believe that we must prepare all of Maryland's students for a global economy and a competitive workforce.   Maryland should be a national leader in educational outcomes for all students and our teachers should be compensated fairly and have the flexibility and autonomy to create the educational classroom experience customized to the needs of the students needs.","Not yet.  During the 2018 Session we made progress by increasing the local governments' mandated share of the gas tax, however we have not fully refunded the amount owed leaving many jurisdictions without adequate road repair funding.  One inequity that should be addressed is that Baltimore City is the only municipality that is required to maintain state roads within its boundaries while all remaining 156 are not.      I am a strong advocate for transit project and the cancellation of the Red Line was a mistake. Maryland must plan forward and plan for transportation needs today that will serve populations in future decades. Moving people by car will not likely be the first choice for future generations.  Projects like the Maglev train will change commuter habits and consumers will expect the State to have the infrastructure in place to support other modes of transportation.      For three Sessions I have introduces legislation to require the Department of Transportation to examine the use of the Chesapeake Bay and its navigable tributaries as our next mode of transit. Moving people quickly across the bay with in a system of low impact high speed water hydrofoils docked in strategic locations among Maryland's waterfront communities could provide a cost effective alternative to a costly new bridge project.       `","During the 2018 Session I was a co-sponsor of HB-1264, a Constitutional Amendment placing the question of legalization of recreational use, possession, cultivation and sale of limited amounts of cannabis on the ballot. The bill failed, however I believe that this issue is one that is larger than the 188 members of the General Assembly. I don't subscribe to the argument that Maryland should do it ""just because everyone else is, because there are many important aspects such as legal, health, banking, zoning, community, religious and personal reasons to consider.  I would like to see this issue publicly debated and let the people decide. The potential revenue is estimated at 225 million dollars annually, which I would designate to open access to drug treatment, which today we simply cannot afford.","Maryland has and should continue to lead the multi-state effort to meet pollution reduction and clean water goals with or without assistance from the federal government.  As the former Chairman of the Local Government Advisory Council representing 1,800 units of local government in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, I know first hand that individuals are responsible for cleaning up the waters in their own backward which eventually drain into the Chesapeake Bay. If we engage the 17 million people, in six states who live in the Chesapeake Bay's 64,000 square mile watershed to simply make good decisions to protect our farms and forests, set clean water goals, minimize stormwater and agricultural runoff, reduce stream pollution, improve sewage treatment plants and septic tanks, the Bay will self restore.  Bay restoration is about awareness of cause and effect, local engagement, empowerment and action. As the former City Manager and lifelong resident of Havre de Grace at the birthplace of the Chesapeake Bay I view the stewardship of this most treasured estuary as a sacred responsibility.","As a baseline, I believe that access to quality healthcare is a basic human right.  It is completely unconscionable that in the United States of America in 2018, we have not been able to develop a cost-effective, quality healthcare delivery system.   I believe the root of the problem revolves around process and that in Maryland, or the US we will not be able to fully address this issue until we conduct a full system analysis. Over the past decade I have spent a great deal of time caring for my aging Mother who over time made her share of trips to a major medical center in Baltimore. Each experience was different, but my experience in organizational development tells me that the systems and process are broken and until they are fixed, the goal will not be achieved. Unfortunately, we tend to look at healthcare in a segments manner and try to address one shortcoming at a time; I believe the state must address our systemic problems head-on.  The first thing I would do is establish a set of benchmarks and outcomes for the University of Maryland Medical System as a pilot project since the State provides a sizeable amount of direct funding as a state sponsored institution. This is so that various models of healthcare delivery systems and efficiencies could be tested and evaluated with real time results for more immediate statewide implementation.","It is important to recognize that Baltimore is Maryland's city and that it is the hub of much of our State's commerce, social, and recreational activity.  If the city fails it impacts surrounding jurisdictions therefore the violent crime is a problem that rests on the backs of City and State leaders to address.     The surge in Baltimore's violent crime rate is an external symptom to an internal systemic problem that is decades in the making.  Years of bad public policy, lack of accountability, loss of job opportunities, reduction in public investment and education have left many residents of certain Baltimore neighborhood in despair.   Crimes committed go unsolved and justice is served sporadically therefore violence becomes an act of behavior modification to those who must try to survive among a culture of rampant unemployment and addiction.  Many neighborhoods have hundreds of boarded up homes and business robbing the community of hope and pride.   The Executive and Legislative leadership should join the Mayor and City Council in developing a comprehensive urban redevelopment authority.  Much like the stadium authority this quasi-government agency would be charged with the responsibility of working with community, civic and church leaders in re-developing the more than 16,000 abandon homes in key neighborhoods with the goal of improving living conditions, creating jobs, educational opportunities, increasing the tax base and the overall livability and vitality of the neighborhoods and business in Baltimore. Such an act would require State Legislation and financial resources.","Having served on the House Economic Matters Committee for four years and visited many of Maryland's businesses I can attest that our business climate is favorable and growing at a rate above the national average. The consensus among business and industry leaders is that in addition to our location and access to transportation, Maryland's is credited for the investment we have made in education, healthcare and quality of life aspects like recreation and access to the Chesapeake Bay.  Our policy decisions like investment in the Port of Baltimore, making it the largest next to New York on the East Coast makes large-scale development projects such as Cove Point and Trade Point Atlantic possible, and mandating paid sick leave sends a message that Maryland cares about our working families and companies like Amazon have responded favorably.","Yes, a non-partisan, independent body to obtain the most objective outcome possible should review legislative and congressional district lines. The challenge is how to appoint such a body that is not beholden to the appointing elected official.  .   2010 as a Member of the Harford County Council I was responsible for redrawing the Councilmanic district lines.  Each County Council member was permitted to appoint a person to the redistricting commission who met independently and developed a redistricting plan that was presented to the Council for approval.  The criteria was simple, each precinct must be contiguous, similar in size; therefore each resulting district must have about the same number of registered voters. Once the plan was presented I tried to fix my district to make it more compact, not more Democratic (actually it would have been more Republican).  My goal was to  keep school districts and communities together but I simply could not make the boundaries balance. I was completely frustrated and my old Councilmanic district remains oddly shaped with a major part of a community separated.     I believe the answer lies in the following: at the beginning of all redistricting processes we must first dissolve all precinct assignments, therefore all invisible ""fake boundaries"" disappear"", secondly establish a set of guiding principles that result in more diverse districts.   My district is one of the few that has a nearly equally proportioned amount of voters with various philosophies which makes for engaging dialogue among my constituents at district meetings.","The roots of the LEOBR stem from the mid 1970's when law enforcement personnel standards were not uniform across agencies and procedures to report brutality, investigate claims and discipline officers varied by agency.  The Legislature established the LEOBR as a framework for police employee discipline based upon a constitutional process.  The codified language established a clear path for police employee discipline through the investigation of a complaint, review board and final decision by the Chief of Police.   One shortcoming of the law is that it is a one-size fits all.  It is applied to agencies of two officers to agencies of thousands.  I am probably one of the few sitting legislators that have any direct experience with the implementation of the LEOBR.  During my tenure as the City Manager I was the immediate supervisor of the Chief of Police.  While I did not participate in the investigation or disciplinary proceeding I was responsible for the proper administration of the process and protection of complainants and the officer in questions rights.    Two changes I would make are as follows:    Involve the City Manager, Administrator or Human Resources Manager in the final decision because they are an out of department independent reviewer of facts and personnel policy.  Depending upon the chain of command and structure of the government that varied among agencies roles and responsibilities, not all Chiefs of Police are trained in Human resources and personnel related matters. The outcome of the LEOBR is only accepted by the community if the integrity of the law enforcement agency is not questionable.  Secondly, I would require an executive summary report be prepared that would be made available to the public that stated the complaint, the process of investigation, and the findings, who participated, if there was a hearing board that was on it and, who made the final decision and what was the outcome of the complaint. This would hold everyone in the process accountable for his or her actions.","The opioid crisis is complex.  There are two types of addicts, one who knowingly sought the drug for pleasure, and the innocent unsuspecting individual who has sustained an injury and sought prescription pain relief from a licensed physician and subsequently became addicted to the drug.  No matter the gateway, both have problems that like other addictive narcotics need to be treated as an addiction.   Poverty, unemployment, depression and other underlying socio-economic issues are all contributing factors to the misuse and epidemic level of deaths resulting from opioid addiction.  While we have taken steps to monitor and lessen access to prescription opioids, I fear that we may have just relocated the problem to another drug of choice.  Until we focus on the major health and socio-economic issues I don't think we will be able to address this crisis in a formidable way. Like many other issues I have outlined above, there are crossover benefits to re-investing in our communities with opportunities to learn, live, work and grow in safe and health neighborhoods throughout our state if we step back and rethink our programs and policies. I'm not afraid to fix what is broken and end polices that simply don't work to invest in ideas that do.","The state could increase our job training programs and diversify our skilled workforce. This would be a positive step toward the state could take along with the private sector to assist low and under waged employees.   I am working on developing a partnership program between Harford Community College and various skilled trade unions that operate training schools. We are outlining a 6 year program that includes 2 years of college, 4 years of occupational training and 2 years of job placement with local employers willing to particpate in the program.","Maryland's Public Information Act and open meetings laws provide a basic process for the general public to access information about matters related to general government matters, however all to often it is difficult for the average citizen to know what information is available, how and where to request it, therefore I believe improvements are necessary. Additionally, I am not aware of any state agency that provides the opportunity to request public information documents on-line or receive them in a digital format. During the 2018 Session I filed two bills to increase public notice for changes to municipal charters HB 615 that passed and will be signed into law, and HB 1540 to enhance public notice upon the proposed closing or downsizing of a healthcare facility.  Unfortunately, this bill did not receive a vote as it faced stern opposition from the Maryland Hospital Association.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

My father, Stephan Loewentheil, owned a restaurant called the Cultured Pearl down the street from my childhood home. I attended the Park School and then Yale, where I graduated cum laude. I returned to Yale for law school, where I graduated in 2013.","As an undergraduate I founded the Roosevelt Campus Network, a national student organization that today has more than 10,000 members at 120 college chapters around the U.S. I served as Executive Director for two years after college.   After graduating from Yale Law, I went to the Obama White House, where I served nearly four years at the National Economic Council. I achieved the rank of Special Assistant to the President, which is a Commissioned Officer position roughly equivalent to an Assistant Secretary in a Federal agency. I was the lead at the National Economic Policy for transportation and infrastructure policy. In 2016, I was appointed to lead a special White House Taskforce for Baltimore City.","The Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education identified four major priorities for education reform - increasing investment in early-childhood education and for at-risk students, reshaping education pathways to focus on college or career readiness; and transforming teaching into a high-status profession with better compensation and more professional development. The Commission also recommended aligning individual schools and school systems with the Commission's recommendations through a new governance system. Although the Commission did not specify  exactly how it would drive change, it suggested tying state funding to reform.   I support and have publicly advocated for many of the Commission's findings. In a major report released in 2012 (https://isps.yale.edu/sites/default/files/publication/2013/01/2012-prosperity-for-all.pdf), and summarized in an opinion piece in the New York Times (https://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2012/10/18/shrink-inequality-to-grow-the-economy/all-will-benefit-if-more-are-made-secure ), I called for Federally-funded universal pre-K, major investment in teaching as a profession, and a national focus on career readiness.  I continue to believe in the importance of these policies. I also support focusing resources on at-risk students.  As always when it comes to policy, however, execution and implementation are critical. To make the kinds of reforms outlined in the Commission's report will require major, statewide political organizing. Put differently, the funding is only one part of the question; the broader question is: is Maryland ready for this kind of commitment and alignment behind a single educational framework and vision? With political support, the funding can be found. My priority will be the political fight - the hard work of building broad consensus in Maryland behind the Commission's recommendation.","The U.S. as a whole is under-investing in our transportation infrastructure, especially public transportation, and Maryland is no exception. I have two basic principles when it comes to investing in transportation infrastructure.  (1)	Fix it first: Research shows that the most significant economic benefits of transportation investment come from fixing our existing infrastructure before we build more (http://www.hamiltonproject.org/papers/fix_it_first_expand_it_second_reward_it_third_a_new_strategy_for_ameri/). The common sense version of this is: fix the potholes. Keeping our roads well maintained and running smoothly will literally keep the wheels of commerce spinning. The flip-side of this is that we should be cautious before we build any more highways. Research has shown time and again that you can't fix congestion by building or expanding roads; people simply drive more.    (2)	Invest in public transportation: Which leads to the second principle: we need to focus our new investments in public transportation. Baltimore is not well-served by our current transit system. As a short-term step, we need to focus on integrating technology into our bus fleet to help users better track buses in real time, focus on 'complete streets' design that balances pedestrians, cyclists and motorists, and investing in more proactive maintenance of our fixed-line transit systems.   ",Yes.,"The Chesapeake Bay is a vital resource, an environmental treasure, and an integral part of Maryland's history and future. Protecting the Bay will be a major priority of mine as State Delegate.   When it comes to protecting the Bay, I believe change starts at home. The single most important thing that Baltimore can do to protect the health of the Bay is improve stormwater management - namely by completing the infrastructure improvements to which we have committed under consent decree with the EPA. The Department of Public Works has a solid plan in place. However, the funding and financing challenges remain steep. While at the White House, I was in charge of the Obama Administration's work on infrastructure financing and launched the EPA's Water Infrastructure and Resiliency Finance Center. Once elected I will work with DPW to explore Federal grants and financing opportunities that can help expedite the completion of this critical work.   My second priority for protecting the Bay will be advancing the Styrofoam ban that failed in this year's legislative session.   But the biggest environmental challenge we face is climate change, which will impact the Bay as it will impact every major ecosystem on our planet. On climate change, I believe the transportation sector should be our state's next area of focus. I plan to pursue a small fee on oil that can fund major investments clean transportation technologies. This proposal builds on a proposal I helped shape in President Obama's FY17 budget (https://www.vox.com/2016/2/4/10919012/obama-oil-fee-transportation).",I am still shaping my policy proposals on health care.,"I believe our state government needs to step in and help the city address this historic wave of crime and violence. I've laid out a detailed four-part plan that includes recommendations for the city, state and public safety agencies.   First, directly tackle street crime and gun violence by expanding community-oriented, beat policing; deploying proven models, like Ceasefire, to deter violent criminals; and mobilizing private sector and local, state, and Federal resources to light up city streets.   Second, rebuild trust in the Baltimore Police Department. Let's implement the DOJ Consent Decree quickly and thoroughly by tying state funding for the Department to reform milestones; improve BPD training; transform the Civilian Review Board into a Police Accountability and Reform Commission; and expand police recruitment with a focus on Baltimore City residents.   Third, we need to fund community programs. I'm calling to mobilize resources to expand after-school programming; establish a new statewide 'block by block' community safety grant program; and fully fund Safe Streets and other public health programs.  Finally, I'm calling for reforms to bring balance to our criminal justice system. We should focus first and foremost on deterring violent crime. That means strong signaling that if you commit a violent crime, you're likely to be caught, prosecuted, convicted and imprisoned. Longer mandatory minimums don't help. Instead, let's improve how the State's Attorney's Office does business - and how our city's safety agencies coordinate. Similarly, let's focus in our juvenile justice system on community mediation programs, but hold repeat violent offenders accountable.","When it comes to creating jobs, Maryland needs to build from strength. Baltimore has always thrived because of the its strategic location on the Chesapeake Bay. Today, the city sits along major highway and freight rail lines with one of the best deep-water ports in the country. That's why the city has seen such strong job growth and investment from companies like Amazon and why we are seeing a revival of the old Sparrows Point as a new center for logistics and light manufacturing. The State of Maryland can help to drive this growth by investing in infrastructure - starting with the Howard Street tunnel.   There's another area for infrastructure investment that does not get the attention it deserves - namely broadband. I believe Baltimore should develop a municipal broadband network that expand access to true high-speed internet and encourages technology and biotechnology companies to locate or stay here.   Another area of opportunity for Baltimore and for Maryland is craft beer. Our neighborhood breweries create jobs, spur neighborhood revitalization and repurpose industrial spaces, and as importantly, make terrific beers. Our state legislature should be fighting for our local small businesses - not backing the big four beer monopolies.  Finally, we need to support entrepreneurship. Entrepreneurs and small business owners create jobs and keep resources in our neighborhoods and our city. I will focus on policies that encourage entrepreneurship and business creation, including subsidizing child-care for low-income entrepreneurs and enacting the Angel Investor Tax Credit.",Yes. Maryland should lead by example in setting up a nonpartisan Commission - not wait to be dragged into Federal Court. I was disappointed in the leadership of our state on this issue.,I am still considering this issue.,"Baltimore has dealt with heroin for many years. There have been two significant changes driving the public health crisis. First, the growth in abuse of prescription opioids; and second, the widespread availability of fentanyl and other high-dosage synthetic opioid products. I have a four-part strategy.  First, I will be an advocate for cracking down on unnecessary opioid prescriptions. The current wave of opioid abuse is one of the most significant public health challenges in America and has almost single-handedly brought down the national average life expectancy. We have to address this at the root.  At the same time, we need to address the immediate crisis of overdose deaths. Here in Baltimore, we should build on Commissioner Wen's efforts to expand access to and emergency use of naloxone. One option is to use state purchasing power to drive down the price of the drug for Baltimore and other cities.  Third, we should improve how we handle addiction in our criminal justice system by diverting people arrested for minor drug offenses and providing more drug addiction treatment options in prisons.   Fourth, as Ben Jealous has suggested, we should create a statewide system for tracking drug overdoses in real time. Many drug overdoses are clustered geographically and in time - often because of a specific opioid product hitting the streets. Better real-time data could help cities, counties and state officials to respond more efficiently. It might also help law enforcement officials to track down providers.","The big challenge in Baltimore is less inequality per se than entrenched, geographically concentrated poverty. A 2015 study from Harvard economist Raj Chetty found that Baltimore City had the lowest rates of economic mobility of any city in the United States. The analysis was complicated, but the moral was simple: if you're born poor into a tough neighborhood in Baltimore, you're likely to stay poor. That's deeply unjust. Our local and state policies should be designed to address this underlying challenge.  The single most powerful tool for addressing entrenched poverty is mixed-income housing. Study after study has shown that moving people from high concentrations of poverty to mixed-income communities has a dramatic impact on lifetime expected earnings. Baltimore City has many tools on the books to push for mixed-income developments - they just require funding and political will to implement.   That's separate and apart from other important policies - like improving education, transportation and workforce training programs. I am also supporting a $15 minimum wage that can help to lift working families out of poverty.",I am still considering this issue.,"Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

Previously, I was a journalist for nearly a decade, including stints with ABC's This Week with George Stephanopoulos, BBC, CNN, America's Most Wanted, and Eurovision.","Largely speaking, I support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education. We specifically need commit to major investments to pre-K and early childhood education, which is key to cutting the achievement gap. My mother has been a public school teacher for more than 30 years and I fully recognize the importance public school funding. There are multiple opportunities to fund the commission's reforms, including using revenues from casinos and legalization of marijuana.","The state's transportation's need are not being met. Maryland needs to continue to invest in affordable public transportation that services all residents. In the DC area, recent WMATA improvements are a start to get riders to start utilizing Metro services again, but they have been insufficient. I would like to see the state continue to invest in high-speed rail and bus rapid transit in higher density areas. Our spending on infrastructure also needs to continue. I believe that we can explore innovative ways to reduce traffic on I-270 and I want to take a leadership role on transportation issues when I'm a Delegate.","Yes, I support the legalization of recreational marijuana and support using the taxes generated from sales to reduce the deficit in school funding.","I am strongly committed to ensuring that Maryland protects the Chesapeake Bay, especially as our federal government continues to dismantle environmental regulations at an alarming rate. Maryland can adhere to the UN's Paris Climate Accord, even if our federal government has recklessly backed out of it. We can work to ensure groundwater is protected from pollutants so that the Bay remains an important ecological and economic point to Maryland for generations to come.  I'm proud to have earned the endorsements of the Maryland League of Conservation Voters and the Sierra Club.","I strongly support the right of all Americans to have access to affordable, quality health care and moving toward a single payer system. I serve on the Montgomery County Board of Social Services, which advises Montgomery County and state officials on issues related to social service programs. I also serve on the NARAL Pro-Choice Maryland Board where I help to ensure that Marylanders have a right to reproductive justice.","Overall, I support criminal justice reform and believe it is a key step in helping communities to start trusting the police again. Attorney General Eric Holder started the shift in the conversations that we were having but unfortunately, those conversations have stopped under President Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Maryland needs to become a leader in community-based policing and I strongly support increased diversity and de-escalation training.","I believe Maryland has a strong business environment, but we can always do better.  As a staffer for the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, I worked on efforts to support small business lending and increase capital to Hispanic small business owners, as well as increase government procurement to minority-owned small businesses. These types of efforts, along with increasing the minimum wage for large corporations, are a good step forward to creating more family-supporting jobs.","Yes, I support the creation of a non-partisan, independent body to draw legislative and congressional maps each census. Every voter's ballot should count.","I believe law enforcement officers under investigation should be subject to civilian review boards not simply the evaluations of their own peers, so that there is a neutral third party involved.","The opioid addiction and overdose crisis needs to be given significant attention and a comprehensive solution is needed. First, there must be more accessible and affordable options to help prevent and treat addiction. Also, physicians need to show more discretion in prescribing opioids, especially on a repeat basis. Additionally, we need to address pharmaceutical companies that have used misleading tactics to encourage the usage of their products, even in situations when it is not medically necessary.","I support raising the minimum wage, increasing the funding for public schools and providing access to affordable health care for all Marylanders.

I'm looking forward to their final recommendations, and expect to support them. Maryland can and should make adequate investments in our schools to provide a great education to every kid. Funding the recommendations will likely involve a number of revenue options, and as far as I'm concerned all options are on the table.","Maryland has historically underinvested in transit, and the Baltimore region in particular does not have the transit options a world class city deserves. We took steps this session to shore up transit funding, including dedicated funding for both DC and Baltimore Metro and MARC. But there is more to do, and expanding rail options in the Baltimore region should be high on our priority list.",I support the legalization of recreational cannabis and have co-sponsored legislation to that effect.,"Given the current administration's anti-environmental bent, Maryland and surrounding states must be vigilant in protecting the Bay.

Cracking down on pill mills and overprescription is an important part of that. One area where we need to do more work is in supporting young people with substance abuse problems. A number of school districts are exploring the creation of recovery schools where kids can continue their education while getting treatment. The state should be supporting those efforts.","Two key ways to reduce income inequality are by passing a $15 minimum wage in the state and by expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit. Longer term, ensuring that our tax policies are progressive rather than regressive, for example by shifting more of our revenues from sales to progressive income taxes, can help reduce inequality significantly in Maryland.","I believe Maryland's public transparency laws are strong, but enforcement of those laws is an issue.

I have my own firm in Hancock. Prior to starting my own business I was employed in the non-profit sector (mostly mental health services). I sit on 5 boards and am currently the Justice Reinvestment Rep. for Washington County.,"Yes, I support the findings of the Kirwan Commission. Children are our future-we should be investing in education and the funding that was to be for education, should be lock-boxed and used specifically for education.","I can't speak to the balance of transportation spending, as we have little public transit options in Western Maryland. Our part of the state mainly requires funding for the maintenance of roads and infrastructure.","I do support legalization, given the outstanding reports out of Colorado. Legalization has done wonders for their economy, expanded business growth in other industries, reduced opiate prescriptions, and they've seen no increase in crime. Additionally, multiple polls show widespread public support of legalization. The people have spoken and they believe it's time to end cannabis prohibition. Politicians that don't support legalization are simply not listening to the majority of their constituents.","Maryland needs to stick to its existing environmental policies. Some argue that environmental regulations are bad for business. Personally, I think shifting regulations with each election is even worse-because businesses won't be able to keep up with the most up-to-date regulations. As a state, we need to look to the future, and that involves protecting our environment. It's possible for us to continuing protecting the environmental resources that make our state great and encourage business growth, simultaneously.","Healthcare is one of the biggest spending priorities in our state, currently. In order to reduce healthcare spending, long-term, we need to focus on public health education. Most Americans are not 'health literate,' and public health education can solve that problem. With a more educated public, we'll be able to focus on preventative care, ideally reducing healthcare costs down the road.","Violence is an epidemic, and we need to treat it as such. Doctors have succeeded in containing and responding to viral outbreaks in third world countries with very little resources. The same public health methods used to contain TB, SARS, AIDS, etc. can be applied to violence. In general, we've got to 1. Interrupt the 'transmission' by detecting & finding first cases (trained social workers can help with this step) 2. Then we try to prevent further spread with outreach workers in violent neighborhoods and communities and 3. We simultaneously engage in public education and community activities designed to shift cultural norms & create a 'group immunity' to violence, in a manner of speaking. This methodology has been implemented as a response to violence in places like Chicago, New York, even South America and shown efficacy .","Maryland is a tough climate for businesses, partly due to its geography. I live in the narrowest part of the state-you can travel 3 miles and be in PA, MD, or WV. Travel 40 miles and you're in VA. That creates a very competitive business environment. Many in Western MD are concerned that our state leads businesses to re-locate to adjacent states in favor of less regulation/taxation. In our region, we need workforce development and resources for small business owners. It would also be helpful to gather regional data (as opposed to state-wide data) that can be presented to larger employers how/why Western Maryland is a great place to live, work, and own a business (a business attraction package).","Yes, gerrymandering is a problem that hurts our democracy. Politicians shouldn't be drawing their own lines (we see where that has gotten us).","One of the key issues I see with the LEOBR is the reliance on polygraph examinations. Polygraphs are permitted (and can be performed without a lawyer present) even though the State does not consider such exams to be admissible evidence in criminal trials. Science does not back-up the use of polygraphs and continuing to use this obsolete discovery method has long-term negative effects on police officers. A failing polygraph can follow an officer throughout their career, even if the 'failed' questions were benign. It impedes their ability to testify and jeopardizes cases.","My answer here is relatively similar to my answer to Question 12. The opioid crisis is an epidemic, and there are effective methods for responding to an epidemic. We've got to help those actively struggling with addiction, deploy intervention specialists in neighborhoods where it is spreading rapidly, and continue with our public education efforts. Also, studies have shown medical cannabis to have a significant effect on reducing opiate reliance. We should actively research the potential for an expansion of our medical cannabis program as yet another method of responding to this crisis. Long term, however, we need to re-evaluate the way we look at mental health. Mental health needs to be viewed (and treated as) an essential component of physical health. Insurance companies need to cover mental health and simple mental health checkups need to be included in everyone's healthcare regimen. I understand this is a broad sweeping change, which won't happen overnight.","Tough question: there isn't an easy fix. Our economy has changed, significantly. Most of the old manufacturing sector, which was a large employer for entry-level people, is gone. Personally, I don't think it's coming back. I think we've shifted into a new economic era. Bottom line, we need to 1. Train people for jobs that exist in our current economy and 2. Encourage entrepreneurship/self-employment. That's about the only way an individual can take 'control' over their income. This goes hand-in-hand with changing the business climate in Maryland (see Answer 13).","Technically, those laws permit some 'oversight,' but I think what most citizens are concerned with is the ability to provide input and feedback (and have their concerns addressed). This goes beyond mere oversight, obviously. I think the laws are sufficient, however. It is (and should be) up to the individual government bodies whether and how they will consider citizen feedback.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

I also would like to see our teachers pay increased so that we are competitive nationally. I would also propose introducing legislation to increase the State's contribution to teachers retirement as well as exempting teacher's pensions from Income Tax.,I believe that Baltimore needs to invest in the repair - and maintenance of - its existing roads and bridges. We need to fix what we have - including buses and light rail - before we commitment to the development of additional modes of public transportation.,No. I have seen the devastation of drugs and do not take Marijuana usage lightly. I believe today's drugs are harsher and more powerful. As a result states that have legalized marijuana use age have realized an increase in the cases of those who drive while impaired. I also think that any form of legalization will make drugs more easily accessible to minors.,I am self funding my campaign so that I won't need to listen to special interests that want harmful development.  The state needs to take a roll in protecting its natural environment by limiting development to avoid harm to the Bay.,Free market solutions that empower citizens to select the health care they want. I would also add that veterans should be given access to the healthcare facility of their choosing. It is my goal to increase access and availability of healthcare for all. I will also work to increase the availability of generic drugs as well as having them covered by health plans.,"More and better paid law enforcement officers.  Create less demand for illegal drugs by increasing  funding for treatment , as well as funding for drug prevention programs. Stiffer sentences for opioid  drug dealers of but also go after the doctors who are writing bogus prescriptions and pill mills. Ultimately, I would suggest suing Big Pharma and making them not only pay for the mess that they have helped to create but also for the aforementioned programs for treatment and drug prevention. Additionally, I would prevent measures aimed at making Md a Sanctuary State, which leads to more undocumented criminals relocating here.","Encourage others to do what I did and purchase a failing business and turn it around so that it creates more jobs and tax revenue.   Follow Governor Hogans plans that ""Maryland is open for business.""  Reduce red-tape and useless regulations that prevent businesses like mine from being even more successful and let them grow.","Yes, we need to take this out of the hands of partisan politicians.",-,I support the efforts of local governments as well as states in their legal pursuit of Big Pharma. Much like the tobacco suits of the past - successful - these funds should be directed to not only prevention programs (at a young age) but should also provide more access to treatment for those who suffer from addiction.,"Income Equality is best dealt with by making Maryland a destination for business. As of now too many job creators are either fleeing the State or not coming here at all. We must reduce regulations, offer incentives to all businesses in the form of tax reductions and not just to the chosen few such as the most recent tax package that was offered to Amazon. Encourage others to do what I did and purchase a failing business and turn it around so that it creates more jobs and tax revenue.   Follow Governor Hogans plans that ""Maryland is open for business."" But make it open for ALL business.",No.  All Committee hearings as well as the proceedings of the Legislature should be available for viewing.

I have a Juris Doctorate from the University of Baltimore,I am an attorney and small business owner.,"I support many of the preliminary areas of consensus from the Commission's January 2018 report including, but not necessarily limited to: - requiring better preparation and support for teachers; - implementing a strong system of accountability; - developing rigorous college and career pathways that will enable students to graduate from high school with significant     college credits and/or industry recognized credential; and - significantly increasing standards for teacher certification","During prior gubernatorial administrations , I believe there was an imbalance of spending between transit and roads which left the majority of Maryland's counties, including Anne Arundel County, on the short end of the stick.    For bang for the buck, the advent of BaltimoreLink was a better use of funds than the Red Line.",I do not support the legalization of recreational marijuana.  I believe recreational marijuana is a gateway drug.,"I believe Governor Hogan's fiscal year 2019 budget in which he provides historic funding to ensure Maryland remains a national leader in enviornmental stewardship and includes a record $1.2 billion investment in wide ranging Chesapeake restoration reforms keeps Maryland on the right course.  Furthermore, for the third year in a row and for the third time in State history, the Chesapeake and Atlantic Coastal Bays 2010 Trust Fund was fully funded by the Governor and the General Assembly.","The right step was taken by the Governor and the Maryland General Assembly in passage of House Bill 1795 (Maryland Health Benefit Exchange - Establishment of a Reassurance Program)  creating a structure for a reinvestment program to be administered by the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange, which is predicted to stabilize rates for the next several years.","A step in the right direction was also taken by the Governor and the Maryland General Assembly with the passage of Senate Bill 1137 (Criminal Law, Prohibitions, Prosecutions, and Corrections) which included Governor Hogan's initiatives to make it easier to prosecute high volume drug deals and to add Fentanyl to the Volume Dealer Law.  The General Assembly continued the Governor's initiative  to address Baltimore's violent crime with the passage of Senate Bill 101 (Crimes of Violence and Drug Treatment) which eliminates parole for second time violent offenders and toughens sentences for anyone convicted of drug trafficking while using an illegal gun.",Maryland's business climate is still lacking and in need of improvement.  The Governor's investment of over $26 million in the fiscal 2019 budget for work development programs to make Maryland's workers have the skills and tools needed to meet the demands of the 21st century global economy will help.,"I support the creation of a nonpartisan, independent body to draw legislative and congressional district maps after each census.  Furthermore, during the 2018 Legislative Session, I introduced House Bill 1022  with 63 co-sponsors from both parties.  The bill calls for Maryland's Congressional districts to be drawn so that each district would be ""of adjoining territory, be compact in form, and be of substantially equal population,"" with due regard given to ""natural boundaries and the boundaries of political subdivisions.""  Article III, § 4 of the Constitution of Maryland mandates that state delegate and senatorial districts be drawn according to these standards, but Maryland's Constitution does not include Maryland's Congressional districts in that requirement.  House Bill 1022 did not pass when the Democrat majority on the House Rules Committee failed to even discuss the bill or to vote it out of Committee.  If the bill had passed, a proposed amendment to Maryland's Constitution would be included on the November ballot, thus placing the gerrymandering issue squarely in the hands of Maryland voters.",The Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights (LEOBR) does provide an appropriate balance for the police and the public.,"I worked on a House workgroup committee to develop legislation to address the opioid addiction and overdose crisis.  The workgroup recommended House Bill 922 which I co-sponsored.  The Bill established a pill mill tip line and requires coordination and interpretation of overdose reports.  The workgroup also recommended House Bill 1092 which establishes a behavior health crisis response grant program; House Bill 359 enables first responder's to efficiently report and track specific overdose information so that resources like overdose treatment can be allocated in near real time to respond to particularly potent opioids in a specific area; House Bill 1480 which requires dispensaries of CDS to report any suspicious order of CDS; House Bill 653 which requires health care providers both before prescribing a CDS to discuss why the CDS is being prescribed, and the risk of using it; and House Bill 1452 which requires license providers of controlled dangerous substances to complete two hours of continuing education on dispensing CDS.  The passed  legislation will hopefully make a dent in the crisis",The state should continue to promote education in our schools and in workplaces so that all Marylander's have a balanced chance to earn an adequate income.,The public's ability to know what is going on in all forms of Maryland's government always needs to be enhanced to ensure appropriate oversight.,"Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

I believe there is still much work to be done and support the changes  with the 9 building blocks for a world-class education system. I will be committed to funding the reform, with proper budget I believe it is not too much to ask for to help develop and better our children's education.","At the moment I believe the roads are getting more attention than the transit system currently in place.  While the roads are very important, we  cannot forget how important it is to many to enhance the infrastructure of our transit system is.  I believe by investing in 21st century transit solutions that ease traffic congestion and promote economic development we will solve many of the current issues we face.","Yes I do support the legalization of recreational marijuana.  Times have changed, I support it more for medical purposes, but realistically this is an issue that will not go away, it is supported by nearly 60 percent of Maryland voters and will inevitably be passed.","We must urge Congress to reject any measures that could dilute the effectiveness of Bay cleanup initiatives, such as removing or limiting the EPA's oversight role.  We must protect Maryland's environment and restoring the health of the state's most important asset: the Chesapeake Bay.",I support Gov. Hogan's signed legislation to prevent the collapse of the state's individual health insurance markets.,"State police, parole and probation officers and juvenile services staffers join warrant task forces; state police staff the Juvenile Booking facility, thereby freeing up city police to patrol the streets; and increase probation and parole visits to the homes of violent offenders.","At least in my District, District 10; I've seen too many business closures and not satisfied with what's being done to help the closed and currents business still open.  I will support legislation to help small business with tax incentives for supporting their community by hiring from there own community.  More start up programs to help business grown and succeed.  Incentives and help to bring back closed businesses that have been loss over the years.","Yes I do, I believe there are many areas here in Maryland including my own District 10 that are not fairly represented.",I do support some changes and updates to the bill.   I support making the agencies processes more transparent.  I also support that officers should undergo mental health evaluations from time to time to ensure they can give the public the upmost reliable and safest care possible.,I believe obtaining help from the federal government on expanding medically assisted treatment will greatly assist in fighting the addiction.  The treatments not only are by prescription but also being able to give a support group to mentally break the addiction and help individuals fight this from all angles.,"Increasing focus on class and poverty will bring forth new challenges, new calls and new cures.   .  Increasing awareness and  teaching economic literacy at younger ages I believe will greatly help our youth close the gap.  Creating more opportunities through education and employment will also help the fight, we must help our small businesses thrive and grow instead of seeing more and more close.","To a certain point only, but it also requires representatives to make more of an effort to come and meet more of their constituents.  Smart & efficient government is about providing service.

I am unsure of the full impact with the cancellation of the Baltimore region, but I believe it to be significant enough to harm employment growth.  Corporations such as Amazon do not consider regions that have poor to mid grade level transit for furture employees.  We must move to a more aggressive approach to obtain larger coporations to increase our business tax base and reduce the burden on homeowners, who carry a significant portion of the taxes.","I support the use of marijuana for medical purposes.  I believe that in some of our progressive approaches we are missing the mark on long term negative impact(s) recreational marijuana is having on our youth below the ages of 18.  Additionally schools are facing more students and parents entering the buildings under the influence, clothing saturated with marijuana which exposes other families to the drug and family members driving them to school exposing them to second hand smoke.  We must be more thoughtful in our long range approach when crafting legislation, removing the emotional attachment and including measures like this on the ballot for a vote.",I believe Maryland should take steps notwithstanding guidance from the EPA and federal government to set our own guidelines to continue moving our state forward on all environmentally friendly measures.,"Maryland should create a commission to investigate best practices in and outside of Maryland that addresses elderly care, youth and elderly affordable healthcare.

I believe it has been abused by some lawmakers to benefit their re-elections and disregarding the will of their constituents.,"The bill was written in 1974 and appears to be outdated which could benefit from amendments that have a more balanced approach which give both parties equal protections.  Unfortunately we have witnessed an imbalance with some officers being held accountable for their actions around the country.  When this happens it develops an mistrust and unhealthy relationships with officers who have not acted unethically or criminally.   Prince Georges County had this issue serveral years ago and addressed it head on with results that has built trust, positive relationships, accountability, community collaboration with alleged complaints and investigations.","I would provide more engagement with our youth, schools and faith-based communities to provide on-going prevenative workshops and access to nalozone.  Also we should hold companies more to task with tracking the amounts and frequency they are prescribing addictive medications.  Secondly pharmacists should have more responsibility in policies that implement and promote the proper uses and dangers of the drug while also reducing opiods usage.","The states should implore a strategic diverse team compiled of predominately under-served populations to obtain a true report of the inequalities.  Thereafter the states should address the inequities by assigning divisions to work directly with those municipalities to create a more balanced system within an adequate timeline.  I feel that in order for this to truly happen in the foreseeable future several members of our assembly would need to be voted out of office or retire, for a more diverse and fair body to be elected.",No.  There needs to be adequate changes to ensure full transparency and accountability.,"Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

Mikulski, 1988-92 - Associate for Federal Relations, The Johns Hopkins University, 1992-2014","As a member of the Kirwan Commission, I very strongly support the findings in the preliminary report and look forward to continuing to meet and make recommendations before our final report is completed. I am committed to funding the reforms necessary to make Maryland's schools among the world's best and have already taken action to help pay for them. This year's budget created a Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education Fund and appropriated $200 million into it as a down payment on Kirwan-recommended reforms. I was also the lead sponsor, along with Senator Joan Carter Conway, on the ""casino lockbox"" constitutional amendment that, if approved by voters in November, will ensure that gaming revenue enhances, rather than supplants, general fund commitments to public education. The amendment directs money in the lockbox be used on areas of need already identified by the Kirwan Commission.","Maryland's transportation spending has traditionally favored road projects and as a result, we do not appropriately balance our resource allocation between roads and transit. The recent emergency closure of the Baltimore subway is a testament to that. Transportation is one of the largest areas state investment, and I do believe we have enough resources to meet our transportation needs. The question is how do we prioritize our resources in a forward-thinking way.  The cancellation of the Red Line was a particularly bitter blow for our city, both for it's transportation impact (the City does not have adequate public transit options to travel east-west) and for the foregone community investment that was set to happen along the route. BaltimoreLink has rolled out with mixed results, though an overhaul of our bus network was long overdue. Yet just investing in the bus network is not enough.  One of the unheralded accomplishments of this session for the Baltimore region was including provisions in the Metro Funding Act to increase operating and capital investment in MTA service throughout the Baltimore region coupled with a comprehensive transit needs assessment for the region, similar to what the Washington, DC region did a decade ago. The needs assessment will be invaluable to determining where and to what level additional state investment is needed to improve public transit in the Baltimore region.","I believe that the tide of public opinion is turning on marijuana legalization and I would vote for legislation to permit the recreational use of marijuana should it come to the House floor. There are enough states who have already experimented with recreational marijuana legalization that Maryland would have a clear idea of the potential impact on public health and public safety. One note I would add, I believe that should Maryland move to permit recreational marijuana the attendant laws and regulations must be developed with an eye towards equity and include provisions to ensure that racial and ethnic minorities that have been disproportionately impacted by the War on Drugs are not shut out of any new industry.","Maryland's delegation to the Chesapeake Bay Commission, I am greatly disturbed by the apparent unwillingness of the Trump Administration EPA to commit to successful Bay restoration efforts. In the absence of federal action, the state of Maryland has an obligation to protect our most valuable natural resource.  This session saw the General Assembly take a number of actions to protect the Bay. First, we affirmed that Maryland will remain in the US Climate Alliance, a group of states that have committed to greenhouse gas reduction goals. We also passed legislation to prohibit the Governor from withdrawing from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative without legislative consent.  Absent leadership at the federal level or in Government House, the legislature can and must continue taking steps to ensure we do not backslide on the gains we've made to clean up the bay and to continue investing at the State level in projects like stormwater remediation improvements.","I believe, first and foremost, that access to health care is a basic right. I am not so rigid in my understanding of health care policy to say that this goal must be achieved by enacting a single-payer plan or via some other means, but the guiding principle should be ensuring every single Marylander has access to affordable care.  Maryland has some successes to tout: our uninsured rate has dropped to 6% this year, after being as high as 14% prior to 2010. Maryland also ranks among the top of all states in new-enrollees, young people signing up for coverage, and lowest number of uninsured.  In 2017, the General Assembly created a commission to review Federal health care changes and make recommendations to the legislature. This year, we created a similar commission to study long-term fixes to stabilize the individual insurance market to keep premiums affordable. If re-elected I will work to make sure Maryland devotes sufficient financial resources to our healthcare system and that we exercise the necessary political will to enact whatever changes these commissions recommend.","The State definitely has a role to play in helping the City address violent crime. In the short term, the state can devote resources to assist BPD, as happened recently with the effort to apprehend offenders with outstanding warrants. The State can also exercise greater oversight of BPD to ensure that available resources are being put to appropriate use and to restore community trust in our police department. This session, we took legislative action to do both of those things.  In the long term, the State can help Baltimore address violent crime before it starts. As one of my colleagues said this session, the best anti-crime bill is an education bill. Investments in early childhood education will help more students get a leg-up. We also took action to make critical investments in evidence-based violence reduction programs like Safe Streets and LEAD. These programs will, hopefully, result in fewer Baltimoreans being involved in violence in the first place.","I believe Maryland is a great place to do business, despite partisan rhetoric to the contrary. What is attractive about our state is our well-educated workforce, our schools, and our infrastructure. If we want to support more family-sustaining jobs, the way to do it is to continue to invest in those areas so that Maryland remains an attractive place to live and work. One of the major reasons Baltimore failed to make the cut for Amazon's HQ2 wasn't our inability to offer tax incentives, but our lack of sufficient investment in public transportation infrastructure. Maryland cannot – nor should it attempt to – undercut other states in terms of the financial incentives it can offer. What sets us apart is our commitment to investments that improve residents' quality of life.","I do support some sort of reform in the way Maryland draws congressional and legislative districts, but the devil is always in the details. The proposals put forward in recent years by Governor Hogan have generally served to transfer authority over the redistricting process from a process shared by the Governor and General Assembly to one driven by the Governor. I think that it is important that we reform the redistricting process as a measure to restore citizens' trust in their government, but the way we do so must be transparent, open, and even-handed.","I believe that LEOBR tilts too far in the direction of protecting police, often at the expense of the public. One way I believe it can be changed immediately for the better is to require citizens to sit on police review boards. This change would help to restore citizens' confidence that allegations of police misconduct are being handled fairly and transparently.  This session, one of the last pieces of legislation passed gives the State greater oversight to address repeat issues found in BPD's biennial audits and forms a commission to investigate the Gun Trace Task Force to make recommendations to ensure that level of corruption is never allowed to take root in our police department again. I think it is imperative that when recommendations come before the legislature as a result of this bill, that we act on them quickly, even to the extent some of those recommendations include LEOBR reform.","We in Baltimore City know better than most the devastating effects of widespread opoioid addiction on communities. One of the challenges in addressing the crisis at the state level is that treatment services are not equally available across jurisdictions. This session, the legislature passed a bill to create grant funding for local governments to better provide services such as mobile crisis teams, 24/7 walk-in services, crisis residential beds, and other crisis response programs. We also passed legislation to require pharmaceutical companies to report to the Attorney General when they fill suspicious orders and to require doctors to discuss the risks with patients if they choose to prescribe opiates.  As with violent crime, the long-term answers are education and economic opportunity, but in the short and medium-term, we can and must continue to invest in resources to expand treatment options and ensure anyone who needs help has access to it.","Income inequality is one of the defining issues of our time, especially in Maryland, the richest state in the country. The government has a role to play in ensuring our prosperity is shared across the state.  The state should focus first and foremost on the factors that prevent equality of opportunity. We need to invest in schools at a level where every child, no matter their zip code, receives a world-class education. We need to pass policies that support working people, like earned paid sick and family leave and an increase in the minimum wage. We also need to deal seriously with the legacy of the War on Drugs, which has disproportionately impacted minority communities. In 2017 I sponsored, and in 2018 the legislature overrode the governor's veto of, legislation to expand higher-education opportunities to returning citizens who want to pursue a better life for themselves. This is just one small way we can expand opportunities for Marylanders who've historically been left out.","I believe that, generally speaking, Maryland's Public Information Act and open meetings laws allow our citizens to exercise appropriate oversight of the government, but that it is also imperative to continually revisit and update those laws to ensure they keep pace with new technology as well as the evolving needs of our citizens. Our guiding principle should be ensuring that state and local government is open, transparent, and accountable.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

Retired Military Officer  Elected Town Commissioner (Bel Air) Elected Harford County Council,"In general, I support the finding of the Commission.  Specifically, I align myself with MABE and am generally in support of their initiatives.  Autonomy for local Boards of Education is paramount.  The prosperity of this state is totally dependent on its relationships to quality education.  That education begins in Pre-K and and for English learners.  Governor Hogan and the Maryland General Assembly made limited progress this year in funding some of the programs identified by the Commission.  A step backward, however, was legislation authorizing the creation of a special commission that will be responsible for remunerating the 23 Counties and Baltimore City with their school construction monies.  Taking that function away from the Board of Estimates should be looked upon as an affront to every voter in this state.  Adequate funding will always be a legislative nightmare, but I support funds for education because it is a fundamental need that fuels commerce, industry, and every citizen's quality of life.","No. The balance is skewed.  Yes, public transportation must be where the population is located to support it, but there has been a  great need for highway funds in the counties to meet the needs of the commuters over longer distances. These roads have deteriorated and are in dire need of the appropriated assets to come back to the counties.  I did not support the Red Line but I do support the Link for the Metro area.",No,The Federal and State Government should take a very hard look at the sewage treatment system of Baltimore City.  It is old as we all know. If truth be known it is probably grossly inefficient and the affluent discharge can't help be contaminated. That problem demands every citizen's support.  The Governor and the Susquehanna River Basin Commission are actively involved in reducing  up stream  farm run off pollution into the Susquehanna River. We are awaiting their findings so a plan can be implemented.  Then we must look for funding.  The Bay is one of Maryland's greatest  economic assets for commercial and tourist trade.,Funding for the  rural counties must be restored and it is folly to turn a blind eye to this problem.  Our rural health departments need the financial assets  to treat the disproportionate number of  lower income families in need of health care. Dental needs of these citizens are treated with pain killers that end up on the street when providing dental care in our rural health departments could solve the problem better.  From Western Maryland to the Eastern Shore and Southern Maryland the fiscal need for our rural health departments has been put on the back burner.,"I support the recent legislation passed by the legislature as a start.  Until the court system gets straightened out in the city and people arrested with a gun are not let back out on the street one and two times, crime will run rampant. First offender is an OFFENDER adjudicate appropriately. A slap on the wrist serves no purpose. The cops are putting their lives at risk trying to get the gun toting criminals off the street and then the courts give no penalty.  Makes no sense.","Every state's business climate is linked to its educational system.  If you can't read or write effectively when you graduate you are not going to find a decent job and that turns idle minds and bodies into folks just waiting to get into trouble.  Where did our trade schools go? You do not have to be a rocket scientists to be a good house painter, landscaper, property caretaker but you do need to  be able to do basic math, fill out an application and read the directions on a container. Until we get hold of the education system in this state and mainly the metropolitan areas, the stagnation will prosper.  Business incubators attract investors, train workers and put folks on the road to success but require some government support.",YES,"The  LEOBR has stood the test of not only local courts but the Supreme Court of the United States.  Some people complain that it is nearly impossible to  fire a Bad Cop.  Frustrating at times because everyone has their ""day in court"" but certainly not impossible as we have recently witnessed in Baltimore City. It is just as hard to fire a government worker many say. The point is that ""due Process"" is the law we ascribe to as citizens of a democracy. A police officer is entitled to the same protection. The LEOBR also protects against higher ranking individuals unjustly bringing suit or claims against those  in lower ranks without benefit of experience or knowledge of the system.","We in Harford County have been among the most aggressive counties in the state fighting the Opioid epidemic .  We take back unused drugs to get them off the street.  We have a pre- release program run by our Sheriff at the detention center to prepare those convicted of substance abuse for life on the outside again.  We need more visible and authentic media attention to how easy it is to DIE from an overdose .  Its called ""tough love"" FOR THOSE YOU LOVE.   Dying from an overdose isn't pretty.  SHOW IT TO THE KIDS IN SCHOOL AND ON TV.","Income inequity is again relative to education.  Many of the urban area school systems are plagued with scandal, contract shortcomings and downright fraud. All of this takes much needed money away from the class room. We need to reduce the classroom size, provide the tools and pay our teachers to teach, and nurture in a safe environment.  Until we get our major urban school systems under control, systemic problems will fester. I applaud the teachers in Harford County. Their dedication to their students can't be questioned.   The state needs to take back their obligation under the retirement contribution for teachers so the counties can put that money toward raises.",They serve well when they are adhered to.,"Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

My undergraduate degree is from the UW-La Crosse with a B.A. in Political Science and English.,"I have been an active entrepreneur creating businesses and jobs in printing and publishing (newspapers, books and magazines) and printing. Currently, I am the owner and president of Advertising Media Plus, a full service media, communications and development firm in Howard County. My initial career was as a reporter, working on weekly and daily newspapers. I also served as an editor and publisher at several publications.","Yes, I support the Commission's findings. The Commission has documented specific areas of improvement for Maryland and we need to invest in those for the good of our children and for our future economic growth. Our students are preparing to participate in a global economy.   All of our children deserve the opportunity to achieve their full potential. I am especially committed to helping children who are now under served by our education system. We need to implement a Pre-K program and to help children who come from economically disadvantaged homes and neighborhoods. We need to improve teacher recruitment and retention programs.   The revenues from casinos must be allocated to fund education, as was promised. In addition, the casinos can pay a larger portion of their profits to the education fund.   Also, savings from current state expenses can be redirected to help our schools. For example, the state utility expense is millions of dollars and an investment in renewable technology will free up funds for education.   There are also opportunities  for new  partnerships with the business community.  As a member of the Howard County Chamber of Commerce, I have explored collaboration with career and technical internships.   Implementing the Commission's recommendations will be a major activity of the legislature and I look forward to helping shape education policy and finding funding sources that will impact the next generation.","The clog of traffic is harmful to business, the environment and to individuals who waste too much time stuck in their cars.  A successful transportation system for the future must be designed that reduces the number of cars on the road.  It is clear that simply expanding roads will not be sufficient as our communities grow. We need investments in transit systems that are efficient, effective, affordable and safe.   Cancellation of the Red Line was a set back that hopefully will be temporary. The Red Line would have been an important link in a transit system that would grow incrementally.   Maryland needs a comprehensive transportation plan that reflects the way that people will want to live, work and play in the future. Many millennials are not interested in long commutes from the suburbs and they don't want to be dominated by car transportation to their work places. Seniors are also interested in options that get them to appointments and recreation without the responsibility of car ownership. Housing patterns, the work force and lifestyles are changing and our transit systems needs to evolve, too.  Maryland needs the equivalent of a ""Kirwan Commission"" to develop a transportation strategy for the future.","I have knocked on more than 5,000 doors in my area and I have heard from many people that it's time to legalize recreational marijuana. Other states have taken this step and Maryland should, too. Legalization will be of help to law enforcement and also provide an additional source of tax revenue.","The Bay is a national treasure and it deserves protection as a great environmental resource. The Bay is also important to the Maryland economy.  Personally, I have participated in Oyster Restoration programs. We should expand these programs as soon as possible.  I also will fight for full implementation of The Forest Conservation Act. We need to protect contiguous forests that provide intact forest ecosystems. We also must improve replanting formulas and existing mitigation systems such as forest banking.   We also need to develop a broader communication strategy to help all Marylanders understand how they are personally connected to the Bay and what they should be doing to protect it.",Having quality health care is a right of all people and we need to encourage universal participation to create an affordable health care system.   Massachusetts created a system that is working. Maryland should adopt a simiar program.  We need to move toward a single-payer system that requires Maryland residents to obtain a minimum level of insurance coverage.,"The state should be actively involved in addressing violent crime in the city. Baltimore is Maryland's signature community. Its health and reputation is important nationally and globally. Baltimore has so much to be proud of and we need to invest in making its charms -- economic, cultural, artistic and historic -- shine.   Addressing violent crime requires a two track system.   First, the state should provide resources for law enforcement to actively reduce violent crime. Working with city leaders, the state should offer personnel and technology to root out organized gangs and violent offenders.  A closer working relationship between law enforcement and the citizens is essential for stemming violence in the city.  Second, more needs to be done to reverse the root causes of crime. Growing and supporting neighborhood associations will stabilize communities. Expanding youth recreational activities and after school programs is also important.  Community schools that involve parents, teachers, school based staff,  residents and other stakeholders offer hope for growing stronger neighborhoods.","Maryland's business climate is improving and can continue to get better. The location of our state provides many advantages. The close proximity to Washington means that we have many federal workers. We also have international institutions related to education, health care and finance. However, more needs to be done to grow our industrial and commercial base.  As a small business owner, I have started companies and created jobs. As a board member of the Howard County Chamber of Commerce, I am mindful that nearly 80 percent of its members have 25 employees or less. They need support from the state by minimizing regulations and offering incentives for new job creation.  We need to encourage entrepreneurs to develop their ideas here and to stay here as their firms grow.","I oppose gerrymandering. Public offices do not belong to political parties. They belong to the people. Drawing district boundaries is a civic process, not a political process. Eliminating gerrymandering is an important ""good government"" reform.   Yes, I support the creation of a non-partisan, independent body to draw legislative and congressional boundaries. These districts should be compact, contiguous and follow natural boundaries.  They should be drawn without information about voters, voter registration or where current elected officials live.","In light of recent issues related to police activity in Baltimore City, I believe that the LEOBR should be reviewed.   Clearly, we want our police to have the resources to do their job. However, we have a number of cases that indicate an over reach. Formation of civilian review boards would be a good step. In addition to providing protection to both the police and the public, these citizen review boards would help to re-establish trust between the police and the people they are sworn to protect and serve.","The opioid epidemic needs to be addressed vigorously on several levels. First, we need to stem the flow by working with doctors to reduce the number of prescriptions for pain.  We need doctors to use prescription drug monitoring programs.   Second, we need more treatment facilities, including beds, to treat those already addicted.     Third, pharmaceutical companies must take responsibility for the opioid epidemic. We need them to step up and offer their profits and resources to reverse this epidemic.","Income inequality is a major issue. If it is not addressed, it will continue to tear our society apart.   We need to provide livable wages and that means we should move to a minimum wage of $15 as soon as possible. Also, the minimum wage should be indexed so increases do not require legislative approval. A livable wage should not be a political football. Indexing is good for workers and it's also good for business that needs to be able to plan expenses.   The tax code should be more progressive. The recent federal tax cuts that provided 50% of the savings to the top 1% added to income inequality.","As a former journalist, I favor sunshine laws and open meetings laws. As a board member of the Maryland Delaware-DC Press Association, I was proud of our vigilance to keep government open and accessible to the press and to people.  More needs to be done to make records available, digitally and online. Costs for accessing records should be reduced. QR codes can make information about public works projects available onsite.  With technology (and its relatively inexpensive application), government actions, activity and records should be more widely and easily available.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

In order to adequately fund the final recommendations, we need to fight for existing dollars, identify partnerships that can produce funding and resources, and generate new revenue by expanding our tax base.    First, casino revenues (roughly $500M) which will now be re-directed to education can help to fund these recommended initiatives.   Second, I will also propose legislation for a grant/foundation-seeking Authority to assist with certain recommendations that private and corporate funders would consider. We are a small, nimble state that can partner on pilot projects to enhance the quality of our education.   Companies like Tesla, foundations like Pew, or nonprofit advocacy groups can partner with our school systems to provide new opportunities for students.  Third, on a larger scale and with a longer-term timeframe, I have a tiered economic plan for expanding the tax base, which includes smart growth for neighborhoods, creating the conditions for small businesses to thrive, recruiting businesses from certain high-paying sectors (i.e., tech, finance, etc..) and investing in renewable energy.  If we prioritize renewable energy in Maryland, we can aim to generate more of Maryland's energy within our state, and sell to surrounding states. This will produce a strong, diversified revenue stream for our state, with an enormous potential for growth.","I would say that we need to spend more dollars on transit, but am pleased that the $167M in dedicated Metro funding was passed in the last two weeks. The  dedicated funding for Metro is a step in the right direction.  If we can recruit Amazon, this investment will pay for itself.  If Amazon does not locate in Montgomery County, we still need this investment to recruit other smaller businesses and expand our tax base.  Forty percent of Metro riders are federal employees, so we need to work with our Congressional representatives to push for federal funding.    We need to ensure that we are addressing the needs of residents and reducing traffic in order to increase our quality of life and entice new businesses to locate in Maryland.  We want to ensure that no additional businesses re-locate to other states. Investing in transportation, and offering affordable, accessible, convenient transportation options is one way to provide additional value to businesses. We don't want to build super-highways, but instead, our solutions should leverage technology and best practices from across the globe.   I defer the Baltimore region transit analysis to those living in the Baltimore region.",I would support the legalization of recreational marijuana. We can establish marijuana sales as a new revenue source by taxing it appropriately and selling distribution licenses.,"We can't let the federal government off the hook for the health of this national, natural resource.  Through the media, we need to create enough tension as legislators and citizens to ensure that federal funding is not dramatically cut.  While the Trump administration has gutted the EPA, we need to change the conversation from one of environmental protections to one of economic sustainability because that narrative will generate more support in DC.  And in the end, that is what is most needed.  We need to commit to sustained funding for addressing environmental concerns for the Chesapeake Bay, and take a regional approach to ensuring we reduce contaminants and stormwater runoff. I support incentiving organic farming practices for industrial poultry farms while assigning fees for farming pollutants. I support the 100% clean energy goal for Maryland's RPS, and strengthening programs aimed at regenerating the ecological life of the Bay. I support incentivizing surrounding towns to increase their green space and to curb stormwater runoff.","A single-payer plan is ultimately the best way to provide broad access to affordable health care. This is not an easy piece of legislation to pass, but it is necessary and Maryland is the right state to pursue it.   By folding employer insurance plans into the single-payer, businesses would no longer be responsible for providing health insurance, and individuals would be granted the freedom to change jobs without potentially losing certain health benefits.   The Obamacare Exchange in Maryland has caused great difficulty for business owners and individuals, as it has dramatically increased premiums in the last two years, which comes when competition is limited.  As a state, our plan for increased accessibility and affordability must incorporate a standardization of fees for health insurance premiums and prescription medication.  Without this, many Marylanders are one health incident away from a severe economic burden with the potential for loss of property or, in certain situations, life.","Violent crime in any part of the state should be the concern of the entire state. We need to prioritize community policing, and more aggressively address the deteriorating relationship between police and lower-income communities of color in the aftermath of Freddie Gray's death.  As a person who doesn't live in Baltimore, I defer to Baltimore community leaders on specific actions; however, as a Delegate I will support and vote to fund efforts that enhance and improve the relationships between law enforcement and communities, particularly those approaches that are based in best practices.     The state can fund crime prevention efforts by investing in education, free college and vo-tech training, job-creation efforts, and healthcare for Baltimore's at-risk residents.  Given its needs, Baltimore should receive universal pre-K and other early childhood interventions as soon as possible.   I have received the Gun Sense Candidate distinction from Moms Demand Action and am a member of Marylanders to Prevent Gun Violence.  I strongly agree with the approach to pass common sense gun regulations, and strict regulations in locations where gun crimes have spiked. We need to close gun purchasing loopholes, and ensure that people with dangerous histories have less opportunity to purchase guns quickly.  I will be a fierce advocate in the General Assembly to this end.","I would characterize Maryland's business climate as fair.  There are 27,000 open jobs in Montgomery County, which is indicative of the overall situation in the state. We need investment in affordable housing surrounding Metro hubs and in workforce development in order to ensure that we have trained individuals to meet the needs of small and large businesses.  We can encourage more partnerships with community colleges and other in-state universities to ensure that we have the trained workforce we need.   I support encouraging an incubator approach by subsidizing office rent for a set period of time, streamlining (and onlining) state requirements for business growth, and providing tax incentives for the growth of our current businesses.  The incubator approach should be applied state-wide, including in Western Maryland and the Eastern Shore where entrepreneurism - along with micro-loans - can be fostered to bring revitalization.  I support the $15 minimum wage, which will help to move our state in the right direction for providing better wages to individuals supporting themselves and their families.    Lastly, we must deal directly with the lack of affordable child care, as this is a major stumbling block for families, especially women who want to re-enter the workforce.  Making childcare tax-free and further subsidizing it for lower-income women is the right approach.    As a candidate for Delegate D18, I have been endorsed by former Governor Parris Glendening, and share his concern for prioritizing shared prosperity throughout Maryland.","Absolutely.  We cannot support gerrymandering when it works in our favor, but complain when it works against us.  Gerrymandering is unethical. The independent, non-partisan body is the right decision.","The 1974 law does not adequately balance protections for police and the public, and as many argue, protects officers from discipline and scrutiny.  We need to respect our law enforcement personnel for the sacrifices they make each day.  We also need to ensure that no individual is harmed or killed at the hand of law enforcement as an accident.    We need due process for city officers. We also need to ensure that everything from minor to gross misconduct is addressed appropriately.  Officers should not be granted special rights when they are investigated for misconduct. There should be no impediments to conducting comprehensive investigations. The responsibility for disciplining police officers should not belong to boards of sworn officers.  We need to remove the wait time for when superiors can question officers. We need to lengthen the timelines that individuals have to bring about excessive force complaints. Civilians should participate as part of a broader board of review.","As a person who volunteered in an opioid clinic in my earlier career with the Jesuit Volunteer Corps, and as a public health executive for the past decade, I would say that any approach needs to be evidence-based and grounded in best practices. Ohio was able to dramatically reduce their overdose and addiction crisis by creating interventions that promoted the responsible use of opioids, reduced the supply of opioids, and targeted overdose prevention efforts. Public awareness campaigns are critical. Mental health funding is even more critical, as so many opioid users are self-medicating for mental health issues that are not yet identified and are un-addressed.  Pharmacists need to be engaged in a state-wide strategy to promote responsible prescribing and must adopt prevention practices.  Other evidence-based approaches include interventions with families and students to reduce risk factors (such as delinquency) and increase prevention (such as honing decision-making  and problem solving skills, as well as successfully resisting peer pressure.) If we target prevention through schools, we can dramatically reduce the addiction rates.    The overdose component can be addressed in part by addressing the underground market of fentanyl. Fentanyl is up to 100 times more potent than morphine, and in many overdose cases, is confused with heroin by the user.","I have worked on issues of poverty at the grassroots level - both in the US and abroad - for a long time. The best way to address income inequality is by offering opportunities to lift individuals, families and communities out of poverty. Education and training is the first prong of a multipronged approach to dealing with income inequality.  I support free community college and free technical/vo-tech education for all Marylanders.  I support laying the ground-work now for free four-year college in the future.    We also need to increase pay for those at the bottom rungs of the economic ladder. We need to commit as a state to increasing the minimum wage to $15/hour.  We need to strengthen our equal pay laws, and work to close the gender pay gap. Women of color receive slightly more than half of the pay of white men for the same work, per recent statistics with EqualPaytoday.org.   Lastly, we should assist in the transition to good jobs. We need to invest in apprenticeship programs, and similar programming to assist with the movement out of poverty. We must facilitate high-quality, accessible childcare.","Government agencies have been known to block access to public information through delays, redactions that many consider unnecessary, and excessive fees, which was reported by the Baltimore Sun nearly two years ago.  The Maryland Public Information Act Compliance Board does not hear complaints that involve fees of less than $350, which is an unreasonable fee for many in the general public and can be considered a barrier to proper government oversight.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

My political work has included managing campaigns for Rep. Jamie Raskin, Sen. Rich Madaleno, Maryland Democrats, and Montgomery County Councilmembers Hans Riemer & Nancy Navarro. I also founded the state politics blog, Maryland Juice.","Yes. In some respects the recommendations seem obvious. Early child education, quality teachers, and enhanced resources for the most at-risk students are no-brainers that will benefit the whole state. Paying for these ideas, however, is the real challenge. This year I supported legislation to create a constitutional referendum to ""lockbox"" casino revenues, to increase education funding.  Additionally, I believe we need to close the ""combined report"" corporate tax loophole, that allows large national and global corporations to dodge their Maryland taxes. Generally, we should also restore more progressive tax brackets that previously generated millions of dollars in additional tax revenue that we are currently foregoing.","No. While road maintenance funds are obviously necessary, the state needs to prioritize transit infrastructure. Instead, Governor Hogan has proposed billions of dollars in toll-funded highway widening projects across the state that are likely to induce car-oriented development and more traffic. Ironically, Hogan also unilaterally lowered the cost of tolls across the state, thereby depleting our bond-backed transportation funding sources. This leaves us with few choices to raise new dollars, except for public-private partnerships that provide the public with less accountability and bring a private entity's profit-motives into setting tolls and other fees. Other states that have gone down this road, including Virginia, now see laughably exorbitant ""Lexus lane"" toll pricing in effect. It's no wonder the Hogan administration has been aggressively relying on excessive and unjust video toll violation penalties to raise new transportation revenues.","Yes. For the last three years, I was the lead sponsor of legislation to let the voters decide the fate of legalization through a ballot referendum. The policymakers are behind the voters on this issue.","Maryland needs to aggressively preserve open space and restrict the discharge and runoff of toxic pollutants into our waterways from the agricultural industry, energy plants, cosmetic lawn treatment, and impervious surfaces. Many of these policies were proposed in various bits of legislation over the years (eg: stormwater fees, chicken waste regulation, ""safe grow"" lawn restrictions, transit-oriented development, coal plant discharge, and more). Almost all of these initiatives failed or were rolled back, so the fight continues.","Maryland is better off than many states, due to our unique ""all payer"" heath care model. Nevertheless, the model relies on layers of entities with profit motives involved in our system. This year we worked to temporarily halt premium increases with a new fee on insurance companies (who just received a federal tax cut), but we are all aware that this is a temporary band aid. Ultimately, we need to continue pushing to restrain excessive prescription drug costs, and put our state on a path to transition our ""all payer"" model to one that achieves universal, affordable coverage. This may require a transitional period where we implement a state-level individual mandate. In the meantime, we need to take back Congress and the White House,  so that we will have allies in restoring federal support to cover the uninsured in our state and constrain costs.","All of the historical data indicates that violent crime spiked in Baltimore after Freddie Gray's spine was snapped and an uprising followed. This has clearly been exacerbated by mistrust of the police, fueled by recent revelations of criminal activity and evidence-planting by law enforcement. Unfortunately, the policy response has been primarily to resuscitate antiquated and emotional ""tough on crime"" laws, without a corresponding effort at addressing what started us down this road. We can make whatever laws we want, but if people don't trust what happens if they call 911, it's hard to see how this problem will be solved.","Like many if not most states, Maryland's business climate is geared toward large corporations and multinational companies. I would like to see this rebalanced in favor of small and medium sized businesses, since they are more likely to cycle state assistance back into the local economy. We can start by reallocating our economic development tax credits toward these more needy businesses. Lastly, we should continue modernizing and expanding our transportation infrastructure, including through enhanced transit services and investment in our port and airport economies.","When policymakers have the ability to require nonpartisan, independent maps for an entire legislative body there are sound policy arguments for doing so. However, this makes less sense when you are only able to do so for a portion of a legislative body. As a result, i support independent redistricting for state legislative districts, but believe congressional districts should be drawn independently for the entirety of Congress. If the latter is not possible, I support doing so in tandem with other states, through an interstate compact.","The role of civilians on review boards should be enhanced in the LEOBR, but fundamentally the real problems I see are with the authorization for use of lethal force in too broad a range of circumstances. The public outcry after unwarranted police shootings is not likely to subside until this root issue is addressed, and training is correspondingly reformed.","The opioid and overdose crises should be viewed as public health problems warranting a harm reduction approach. We have made great strides in promoting the use of lifesaving drugs like naloxone and shielding those who call 911 for help from prosecution. We have also begun more aggressively monitoring opioid prescriptions and steering people into treatment instead of jail. But fundamentally, we need more resources targeted at substance abuse treatment, given the long waiting lists we currently see at facilities. Additionally, on a macro level, we need to address the economic undercurrents and social malaise that feed the current wave of substance abuse.","Maryland should reinstate it's millionaires tax bracket and roll back recent tax breaks for those who stand to inherit multi-million dollar estates. These two reforms alone would generate almost $1 billion in revenues during each four-year legislative term. Additionally, casinos currently keep a lion's share of profits, when they should be putting their fair share into the Education Trust Fund. Lastly, Maryland has numerous corporate tax credits that have been deemed ineffective by our state's nonpartisan legislative analysts. These giveaways, mostly to weapons manufacturers & arms dealers, should be redirected from multinational companies, to local small and medium sized businesses.","No. PIA officers too frequently deny requests or attempt to charge excessive fees for public records. Last year I had to pass a bill to require police to explain why they can't redact documents instead of denying public records requests, when the Montgomery County police refused the press access to files regarding rape cases that they deemed ""unfounded."" I also previously introduced legislation to livestream General Assembly floor debates and to post written testimony submitted at bill hearings online. There is no solving this problem. The legislature must be proactive in monitoring compliance with the spirit of our PIA laws.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

They have not only drilled down on current limitations of our school objectives and outcomes but also developed areas of opportunities to provide a paradigm shift for public education. I am deeply encouraged of the commission's evaluation and understanding for the need to address the correlation of school funding formulas to concentration of poverty. Equity in education is essential to level setting the playing field and providing all of Maryland's children the opportunity to take full advantage of all the opportunities our state has to offer. I am excited about the emphasis being placed in early childhood education. Through empirical data, we know the sooner a child is placed in a productive learning environment, the better the outcomes we see matriculating through our school systems.   As a committee member on Ways and Means, I am committed to funding the reforms necessary to moving our school system rapidly in the right direction. I think there are several opportunities to establish funding mechanisms to ensure reforms take effect.  Over the course of the next 4 years we will start receiving 100% of the Educational Trust Funding as a supplement to existing school dollars, we will also start receiving revenue from new streams of money, such as, medical marijuana and potentially recreational marijuana. Implementing the Kirwan recommendations is a  MUST!","Mass transportation in the Baltimore Metropolitan area is anemic and the Achilles heel to the expansion of sustainable economic development. Governor Hogan's decision to cancel the Red Line and insert the BaltimoreLink bus overall  as it's replacement has major long term implications in our ability to compete and grow proportional to neighboring metropolitans. The Red Line was not a perfect project, like any project of it's size and scope, but was a game changer in terms of connecting people to jobs, increasing quality of life, and an economic stimulus to our economy. Studies show the number one determinant of upward mobility out of poverty is the presence of a robust transit system.  The readjustments and the allocations, in this years budget, to highway user funds will deem a significant benefit to Baltimore but doesn't erase the reduction of spending and deferred maintenance Baltimore has experienced  over the past couple of years. Since we are the only jurisdiction in the state responsible for the maintenance and upkeep of state roads in our boundaries, we are always at a disadvantage to the propotional amount we receive from the state.   Transportation must be a priority and unfortunately that has not been the case in Baltimore. We are far from the days of Baltimore being a national transportation leader through technology and innovation and we need the new administration to make that a core competency.","I believe the legalization of marijuana is inevitable due to the regulated roll out of medical marijuana and the legalization of recreational marijuana in bordering areas, such as, Washington DC. I will support a responsible and sensible solution to the legalization of marijuana but I will adamantly fight to ensure the wealth created by it's presence is proportional spread out in the areas that have been disproportionately impacted by over enforcement.","As Marylanders, we understand the vital role the Chesapeake Bay represents to our economy and environment and regardless of what the federal governments stance is on Chesapeake Bay restoration regulations, Maryland must maintain to current level of effort of restoring and sustaining the bay and our waterways.",Maryland must continue down the path of having open and accessible heath care exchange opportunities regardless of the federal administrations attempts to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. Healthcare in our country should be viewed as a civil right and we must ensure we provide access to all Marylanders.,"The state has a vital role in supporting Baltimore's attempt at addressing violent crime. We must learn from mistakes of the past, particularly as it relates to the explosion of opioid usage and all the violence that has resulted from it. We have to do a better job as a state to cut the root out of this epidemic and hold the pharmaceutical companies, drug distributors, and healthcare professionals who are engaging in ""Pill Mill"" operations and illegal drug trafficking to our streets, accountable in the same proportion that we hold to street dealers. Without the state sending a serious, severe, and firm message to the medical institutions who have created, perpetuated, and sustained this epidemic, we will not see the level of usage, overdose, and violence decrease that we desire. The explosion of drug usage has always caused an explosion in violence and applying mandatory minimums to street dealers will not stop it.","For far too long we have become accustomed to focusing in big business as opposed to supporting and learning the intricacies of small business. Small businesses are the engine to our states economy. The more we do to protect small businesses successes and trajectories, the stronger our working families and communities are in the long run. Maryland is an amazing state with a tremendous amount of natural assets and resources, amazing geographical location, and educated workforce. Those characteristics provide an amazing foundation that can be used to synergize small business growth. We must identify tax incentive programs that work for small businesses the same way we consistently develop unsuccessful programs in an attempt to lure big business.",Yes.,"The Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights (LEOBOR) does not adequately address balance of protections for the police and the public. The one thing that we have learned through recent police involved incidents, such as the tragic deaths of Freddie Gray and Det. Sean Suiter and the GTTF racketeering and corruption convictions is that police officers should not be placed in the position to solely investigate their own members. One main concern in the LEOBOR is the protection to have only sworn law enforcement officers participate in the initial interrogatory of an officer. That is even more problematic when the officer is interviewed by their peers who they have come up through the ranks with and worked side by side with. There should be an indepedent body to investigate such cases. The current arrangement of having officers invistigating their peers is unfair to those officers and drives increased concerns around transparency and crediability to the general public. The LEOBOR should also mandate the change of administration trial board compostion to require the inclusion of non sworn officers participation.","The healthcare system and healthcare providers are supposed to add value to our communities and not participate in the nefarious practice of using someone's addiction as a means of gaining wealth. We must do a better job of holding ""Pill Mill"" practices accountable for their actions to ensure we cut the problem out at the root. I propose applying stiffer criminal penalties for individuals who facilitate in the practice of running ""Pill Mill"" operations.  I also support the concept of augmenting the reach and services of the newly created stabilization center and proactively providing additional diversion services, resources, and incentive in Drug Court. Lastly, we must continue to expand the awareness and education of the disease to all Marylanders, including our children.",I support a statewide mandate of increasing minimum wage.,Yes,"Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

,YES,state-house,42B,Daniel Nemec,Nemec,11/6/1985,Parkville,Democratic,Baltimore County,http://www.danielnemec.com,,,http://surveygizmoresponseuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/fileuploads/296249/4297291/44-ac8796e4da13b3e686013e480e615b51_headshot-why.jpg,"University of Maryland Bachelor of Science, Accounting Bachelor of Science, Operations Management","Certified Public Accountant, license 39048, since 2011 Finance and accounting professional since 2009","Among other things, the commission recommends strong support for early childhood education, phasing in an increase of teachers' salaries, and creating an effective system of career and technical education and training. I support all of these recommendations.   This may not be popular, but it needs to be said. Maryland needs to impose a tax on carbon dioxide production. This encourages good behavior and discourages bad behavior. We can use the money raised from this tax to invest in clean energy, build better roads and public transportation, and above all fund public schools. Moreover, any funds that were promised to public schools from the gaming industry must make its way to our public school system.","Ultimately, public transportation needs more funding.  Baltimore is one of the only major cities in the nation without a properly and efficiently functioning local rail system. The Light Rail only serves the wealthier, central area of the city and the bus system has always been terrible and the adjustments haven't improved the system at all. Also, services such as the Charm City Circulator, which is free for public use, only serve the higher income areas as well which makes no sense. By creating revenue from a carbon tax or the legalization of marijuana, we could possibly have more funds to allocate towards improving our transportation infrastructure and therefore improving the quality of life for all Baltimoreans.","Yes, I do for several reasons. One reason is that, by many sources, marijuana is less harmful than alcohol and cigarettes. There's no doubt that long-term use of marijuana has an affect on the human body, but no more so than alcohol.  Another reason is that it is immoral to imprison humans for using marijuana. The war on marijuana leads to a black market that criminal organizations use to fund violent operations. It has contributed to the explosive growth of incarceration in the US over several decades. Moreover police enforcement of marijuana possession and use distracts them from crimes that hurt real victims. Despite the costs, millions of people still use a drug that most Americans view as relatively safe.   Lastly, we have seen success in other states that have legalized and regulated marijuana. By some reports, Colorado has spent its early revenues renovating schools, funding treatment programs, and combating dropouts and bullying. On top of that we are in the middle of an opioid epidemic. In places where marijuana is legal, opioid use drops.","Nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment pollution are the top contributors of weakening the ecosystem of our Bay. Maryland must continue to work towards reducing pollution below the total maximum daily load it can withstand. This isn't just about animal and plant life; it's about human life and commerce too.   We must continue to encourage farmers to use conservation practices like cover crops, forest buffers, and streamside fencing to reduce agricultural runoff into the Chesapeake Bay. Nutrient management planning for all agricultural operations in Maryland are mandatory, and we need to ensure that farms comply with these regulations. These ideas not only reduce agricultural runoff but can reduce a farm's operational costs and improve a farm's production.  I've mentioned this in a previous question: Maryland must impose a carbon tax. Every serious economist, scientist, and mathematician supports this idea.","We live in a country where lots of people don't have healthcare. Even after the ACA, there are still people who don't have health insurance. However, the idea that the most vulnerable people in this society are not going to have access to basic healthcare in this incredibly rich country is shocking. Health insurance companies are in the business to make a profit. As a result, they charge high premiums and copays, refuse insurance to people who need it the most, and make the claims process more difficult than it needs to be. There is no question that the United States should implement a single-payer healthcare system like the rest of the modern world.  Many states have tried to implement a single-payer system at the state level and have failed. We should at least be trying to make affordable healthcare more accessible. California is currently exploring a bold and controversial new plan to keep healthcare costs in check by letting the state government set medical prices. I think Maryland should do something similar. I propose that we establish a new state authority to regulate prices that health insurance plans charge. We should use Medicare prices as a baseline on we charge for medical care.","Total violent crimes have risen roughly 30% since 2014. We can increase police presence and give them better resources, but that only goes so far. We must address the root cause. The problem is that many of these people are desperate. They've grown up in poverty without adequate education or strong leaders. Baltimore City public schools has an average high school graduation rate of just 56%. Their neighbor Baltimore County has an average high school graduation rate of about 81%. It's no coincidence that the median income of the city is a fraction of that of the county. Furthermore, the unemployment rate in the city is about 8.6%.  We need to ignite Baltimore City with better access to education, after school programs, and decent paying jobs. Educated people are less likely to commit crimes. One study showed that the nation could save as much as $18.5 billion in annual crime costs if the high school male graduation rate increased by only 5 percentage points. At only 56% high school graduation rate, there is a lot of room for improvement. If we keep children in after school programs, we keep them engaged. Finally, someone who works 40 hours a week on minimum wage earns about $20,000 gross annually. That's assuming they don't take a day off. After paying for necessities like rent, food, utilities, taxes, etc, one hardly has anything leftover for themselves. When people are hopeless and desperate, they resort to crime. Introducing a livable wage would be a solution.","As of the third quarter in 2017, Maryland has a GDP of about $398 billion. This is higher than the majority of other states and some countries. So our economy isn't doing too bad, but we can do better.  Maryland can certainly do better for small businesses and family owned business. We must look over our licensing laws and general regulations to consider what changes may help businesses thrive without creating undue risks to the public. Expanding state-subsidized health coverage would help businesses avoid the high costs of administering an employer-driven health insurance plan. Small businesses already have a tough time competing with large companies recruiting talent as the basis of salary; there is no need to add to the difficulty of running a small business by tacking on the difficulty of offering a competitive health insurance plan. We can also improve public transportation so that people can get to their jobs faster. This will enhance quality of life in the state so that we attract more employers and employees.","In a time where there is so much divisiveness in our country, this is one issue that both major political parties can find common ground. This question addresses the issue of gerrymandering which is fundamentally unfair. It's fundamentally unfair when Republicans do it, and it's fundamentally unfair when Democrats do it. It is bad public policy to let politicians choose their voters rather than the other way around.  I would support legislation that commissions an independent non-partisan authority to draw legislative and congressional lines without regard to how voters are registered. A healthy democracy requires an informed public to be actively engaged in the selection of its representatives. Gerrymandering effectively aims to give one political party an unfair advantage over the other.  I would also support legislation that would change our voting system to reduce the effects of gerrymandering. Particularly, the use of multimember districts alongside voting systems to establish proportional representation such as single transferable voting can reduce wasted votes and gerrymandering. In other words, I would support sensible legislation that proposes an alternative voting system, like ranked-choice voting, in favor of our current voting system where people have a single vote for a single candidate.","In my opinion, it does not. To summarize, the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights (LEOBR) protects American law enforcement from investigation and prosecution arising from conduct during official performance and gives them certain privileges additional to those provided to other citizens. For matters of emergencies, it makes sense that an officer can ""break"" local speed limit laws in order to arrive timely. But this idea can be abused. We have seen instances in other states and our own where police officers have betrayed the trust of their community and put citizens' lives in danger. There must be a balance between allowing police officers to stray from the law (like breaking the speed limit) from time to time and protecting citizens.   I would support legislation that allows the formation of civilian review boards to give civilians oversight over police actions.","Studies show that in areas where marijuana is legal, opioid use lowers significantly. The legalization of marijuana in our state would give people suffering with chronic pain an alternative pain relief that is non-addictive. However that is not the only step in our opioid crisis.  People need access to healthcare, proper healthcare.  If someone doesn't have health insurance, they end up in emergency rooms where doctors prescribe them those types of drugs.  If someone was able to see a pain management therapist at a reasonable price, or even had more open and adequate access to any type of healthcare, opioid use would decrease.","If there is only one issue we should address in the state legislative session next year, it should be this. History tells us that when income inequality is allowed to go on for a long enough time, bad things happen. It's bad for the poor, it's bad for what's left of the middle class, and it's bad for the wealthy too. This is why America exists in the first place. The loss of shared prosperity was the reason for the French Revolution, Peasants' Revolt, Tiananmen Square protests, and many other revolutions that occurred throughout human history.   One obvious solution to address income inequality is to raise taxes on the wealthiest people in the state. Those people can afford to pay extra taxes without taking away their quality of life. Another solution would be to increase the minimum wage to $15 per hour. This would help bridge the gap between being low-income and being middle class. People who don't have to live paycheck to paycheck can also have extra money to invest back into our economy.","Not enough. Not only do citizens need to be able to get the information, but they need to be able to do something about it. I believe we need a citizen oversight committee of sorts.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

I spent the past ten years working on science policy, both on Capitol Hill and at the non-profit American Institute of Biological Sciences.  During that time, I trained more than 1,050 scientists to better communicate their research with the public and policymakers.","A strong public school system is of vital importance to Maryland's future.  Research is clear that states that invest in K-12 education reap the rewards of a stronger economy, as well as better outcomes for individual students before and after graduation.  Maryland must invest in our public education system with additional funding.  We should implement the recommendations of the Kirwan Commission, especially relating to addressing the achievement gap.  These recommendations include universal pre-K, increasing support programs for low-income families, measuring school readiness for incoming kindergarteners, and creating an early warning system to identify students that are falling behind.  I'm especially enthusiastic about universal pre-K.  As a scientist, I turn to research and data as the basis of sound policymaking.  The science is clear on the benefits of pre-K for four year olds, namely gaining the social and cognitive skills they will need to succeed throughout their entire lives.  To adequately fund our public schools, Maryland needs to put a lockbox on the Education Trust Fund.  Although the Education Trust Fund is being used to fund education, the state has meanwhile decelerated funding for schools from the general fund.  In fact, the share of general fund monies spent on public schools has dropped from 21 percent in 2011 to 18 percent in 2017.  This is not in keeping with what voters supported at the ballot box when gambling was legalized.","Public transportation is key to addressing the traffic congestion that plagues many parts of the state.  Maryland needs to invest more in public transportation.  The recent approval of permanent, dedicated funding for Metro is a step in the right direction, but we need funding for other projects, including in other parts of the state.  New lines, such as the Bus Rapid Transit in Montgomery County, will provide much needed options for people to commute, go to school, and run errands.  Additionally, Maryland should support expansion of MARC service as another valuable way to serve the state's commuter transportation needs. MARC train service should be more frequent and have additional off-peak options in order to further increase ridership.  Bike lanes and pedestrian safety improvements are also an important part of our region's transportation needs.  People must be safe and also feel safe to choose to get out of their cars.  That's why I'm pushing for the statewide adoption of Vision Zero.  Vision Zero has been successful in other states and countries in decreasing deaths and serious injuries on roadways and in increasing people's comfort with using alternate modes of transportation, such as bicycling and walking.  Vision Zero calls for better street design, better education for both drivers and pedestrians, and reducing conflicts between fast moving cars and vulnerable road users, including pedestrians and bicyclists.","Maryland should legalize recreational cannabis for adults age 21 or older.  The main reason I favor legalization of recreational cannabis is because of racial discrepancies in arrests for possession.  According to one study, African Americans are eight times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than a white person is in Maryland.  Legalization also presents an opportunity to raise additional funding for public education, by imposing a sizable excise tax on marijuana sales.  Other states, like Colorado, that have taken this step are seeing growing revenues for public schools.","Years ago, I spent a summer while in college studying restored oyster reefs on the Choptank River on Maryland's Eastern Shore.  I saw firsthand the impacts Maryland's restoration efforts are having on the Chesapeake Bay and believe that restoration of the Bay is critical for Maryland's future.  The Trump Administration's proposal to eliminate funding for EPA's Chesapeake Bay cleanup program is very troubling.  Although Bay restoration will be most efficient if the federal government and states in the Bay watershed work together, Maryland cannot sit idly by if other jurisdictions fail to uphold their commitments.  The improving health of the Bay shows that Maryland is doing many things right.  Stormwater runoff, however, is a major contributor of nitrogen pollution, and the state needs to step up efforts to address stormwater runoff in urban and suburban areas.  Timely issuance of permits to municipalities would ensure that local governments are addressing their share of the problem.  Rockville and many other towns have been waiting for years for the state to issue their permits.  It's difficult for local communities to do their part without this guidance from the state.  Maryland should also limit the expansion of large, industrial-sized poultry farms, which are proliferating on the Eastern Shore.  They have an outsized negative influence on the Bay's health.","The rising costs of healthcare are a growing burden for many people.  This is especially true for people who get their health insurance through the state healthcare exchange, which includes both individuals and small businesses.  Insurance premiums increased by an average of 52% since last year for one of the two insurance companies that provides plans in the individual health insurance market.  This is clearly not sustainable.  During the 2018 legislative session, the General Assembly passed important reforms to stabilize the health exchange, including applying for a federal waiver to allow the state to develop high-quality, affordable health insurance while maintaining the protections granted in the Affordable Care Act.  In the longer term, Maryland should consider single-payer health care.  It has the potential to offer benefits such as improved access to medical care for all residents and cost savings for individuals.  In an ideal world, the federal government would create a national single-payer system instead of a patchwork of state plans.  But without that federal leadership, it may make sense for individual states to go it alone.","The state has a vested interest in addressing safety issues in all of its communities.  That said, I would defer to elected officials in Baltimore as to the specific ways the state should assist.  It is also worth noting that stronger gun control laws could help to address the dramatic increase in shootings in Baltimore in recent years.  In 2017, 301 people were shot and killed in the city.  Currently, under state law, local governments are preempted from having gun control laws that are stronger than the state.  I will push for Maryland cities and counties to have the ability to enact stronger gun control laws to address specific concerns in their communities.","Maryland is fortunate to be home to the biotech corridor, to multiple highly regarded universities and colleges, to some of the best public schools in the country, and to a highly educated workforce.  We also have a AAA bond rating—something that most states cannot boast—and our economy grew at 2.5% last year.  The prospect of Amazon locating its second headquarters in Montgomery County potentially means tens of thousands of new high-paying jobs being created.  This could be a great opportunity for Maryland and Montgomery County, so long as proper planning and investments are made in public transportation and local schools.  There will also need to be careful planning by the County to meet the additional housing needs and to ensure that affordable housing is not squeezed out of the market.  Although the state is headed in the right direction economically, government agencies and programs should ensure that their internal processes are efficient and easy for their customers to navigate.  Speaking from personal experience, that is frequently not the case.  The state should strive to put more services online, when possible, and to leverage technology to optimize the user's experience.","Maryland should be ashamed that we have one of the most gerrymandered congressional districts in the country.  I support the plan that was proposed by then-State Senator Jamie Raskin to have Maryland move forward in a compact with Virginia to have both states redistrict simultaneously.  As a result, both states would get more compact districts without changing the net partisan makeup of the U.S. House of Representatives.","In general, I support civilians being more included in police oversight.  Specifically, I support having a member of the public serve as a voting member of police trial boards.  Participation by a properly trained member of the public makes the board more objective.  This would require a change in Maryland state law and legislation to implement this proposal died in the House of Delegates this year.","Maryland and other states cannot wait for the federal government to act to address the opioid crisis.  Our state has experienced one of the highest per capita increases in overdoses.  The task force convened in 2015 to address the epidemic was a positive step, but the growing number of overdoses indicate that much more needs to be done.  Prevention: -Maryland should strengthen our state law that limits the prescription of opioids.  Current law requires health care providers to prescribe the lowest effective dose and the smallest quantity of pills needed for the expected duration of pain. We're the only state in the nation with this standard.  Meanwhile, the 15 other states that have laws limiting opioid prescriptions have limits based on a specific number of days (3-14 days, depending on the state).  That's a much clearer standard for a doctor to follow. -33 other states require an assessment of each patient for possible substance abuse disorder prior to receiving an opioid prescription.  Maryland should enact a similar law. -Require pharmacists to check ID before dispensing controlled substances.  Treatment: -Other states have had success with public awareness campaigns to reduce the stigma of treating addiction and informing people about treatment options. -Funding to address the crisis has been inadequate.  This year, the Governor proposed a paltry 2% increase for community behavioral health providers.  These providers are working on the frontline of drug addiction treatment and rehabilitation.","Maryland needs to take multiple steps to address income inequality.  1) We need to increase the state minimum wage to a $15 an hour.  The cost of living is high in this region and a person cannot support their family on $10.10 an hour.  (This is the statewide minimum wage as of July 1, 2018).  I supported the change to a $15 minimum wage in Montgomery County and have pushed for the county's higher minimum wage to be implemented by the City of Rockville, which is not required to comply with the County law.  2) We need paid family leave.  One of my top priorities, if elected, is to create a system for paid parental and family leave in Maryland.  New parents should be able to take time off of work to bond with their infant or adopted child without worrying about making ends meet.  The same should be true for a person who needs to care for an aging parent or ailing spouse.  California's paid family leave system is a great model for Maryland, as both the employer and the employee both pay into the system.  3) Community college should be free for graduates of Maryland high schools.  This is a key step to making higher education affordable for all students.  Students would have to apply for other need-based aid first, and the program would cover any remaining financial gaps for tuition, thereby keeping the cost of the program low.",Attorney General Frosh's December 2017 report on this subject includes many good recommendations which should be taken up by the General Assembly and the Governor.,"Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

The Kirwan Commission is the single most important reason to send me to the House of Delegates. We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reshape our schools, and it's coming in the next 2-3 years. We need experienced teacher-activists to shepherd us through the process and help push for desperately needed changes in teacher recruitment/retention, pre-K, career/technical education, STEM offerings, arts, and more.    The underfunding of schools is clear throughout the United States, and Maryland is no exception. The devastation of property values during the financial crisis greatly harmed government coffers and made an already-bad school funding situation in the United States still worse. The extent of that funding crisis was made evident here in Montgomery County by the legal hoops county officials jumped through just to prove they had the right under state law to shirk their maintenance of effort obligations. We are finally starting to recover from those darkest of dark times (at least financially), and we face a serious risk of underestimating what our spending levels on education should be because anything will seem like a big improvement compared to where we have been.   The case for tax increases has always been a tough one to make, but we need a one-two punch of new revenues and robust economic growth to get our economic furnace burning again.","Though maintenance of state roads is important, I believe investment should focus on transit.  Baltimore desperately needs transit investment that will spur development, draw residents, and connect the city.    I do not support Governor Hogan's splashy but substance-free proposal to expand I-495, I-270, and the BW Parkway. All experience shows us that building more highways can hollow out communities while inducing further traffic demand. For this reason, transit expansions would instead be a much better use of limited state funds. My priorities specifically would be:  all-day, two-way MARC service an infill MARC station in the White-Flint area true bus-rapid transit via the Corridor Cities Transitway, Route 29, and Route 355. I have been a consistent supporter of BRT in Montgomery County, most recently advocating for a study of the BetterBRT plan for 29.  That is all not to say that we should not invest in roadways. Cars in suburban Maryland are not disappearing anytime soon.  I, however, would want to make sure that existing repairs are prioritized before adding even more road infrastructure. Any additional freeway lanes should come from repurposing existing median space, not widening; I would like to see that new lane space devoted to dedicated transit, such as bus-rapid transit or HOT/HOV lanes. We should be extremely wary of Virginia's model in this regard, where the PPP leading to 66 toll lanes actually forbids expansion of the orange line. I would vehemently oppose any such deals that hamper transit infrastructure to prioritize roads.","The time has clearly come to legalize marijuana. States throughout the country have accomplished this, ensuring that no one will be punished for using a substance that is much less dangerous than alcohol. Maryland should be one of those states.   That said, Maryland should also be a leader in the design of its marijuana legalization policies, recognizing that just because marijuana isn't as destructive as alcohol or heroin doesn't mean that it can't be harmful to its users. As marijuana policy expert Mark Kleiman points out, alcohol policy in this country has largely been a failure, with more than 90,000 people dying as a result of their own or someone else's drinking. One way our policies differ on these two controlled substances differ is the business we have allowed to grow up around them, he explains. While tobacco companies have been (rightfully) villainized and banned from advertising, we all laugh along with the ubiquitous funny commercials produced by beer companies. If we end up with large conglomerates running marijuana business in Maryland, our state will be much worse as a result. Imposing a requirement that legalized recreational sale would be limited at most to non-profit producers should be a starting point for legalization, as should a ban on advertising on mass media. While recreational marijuana should definitely be legal, I am not eager for Maryland to embrace the Philip Morris or Anheuser-Busch of cannabis.","The Bay matters both emotionally and economically.  I hope that Clean Water Commerce Act's credit trading scheme will show real pollution reductions, but I do have some concerns about how the massive size of its Western Shore/Eastern Shore/Susquehanna region might not create enough pollution reduction in the places that need it most.  If this does not lead to noticeable decreases, we should tighten up the plan with more restrictive caps.   We need to take a hard line on the Conowingo Dam license renegotiation.  Though upstream sediment and nutrients are not the only threat to the bay, they are certainly important challenges.  With the dam full a decade ahead of schedule, post-storm nutrient washover sets back the work of cleaning up the Bay.  We have a once-in-a-generation moment to demand that Exelon bear more of the burden and not leave the taxpayer to pick up the entire tab for expensive and temporary dredging operations.    Long-term, the other part of the solution has to be working with Pennsylvania and New York to control sediment and nutrient pollution at the source through cooperation with the whole watershed.  Also, we will have to continue to work with our federal delegation both to pressure the EPA into demanding more aggressive nutrient limits upstream in Pennsylvania and to stand up to President Trump and protect the EPA itself, whose crucial Bay cleanup program is perpetually at risk due to looming agency budget cuts.","I believe that Maryland should explore options for single-payer health care within our state. To create a single-payer model that meets the unique needs of Maryland, we will need to work together across multiple stakeholders. From health care providers, to employers, to policymakers, to the wealth of health care experts we are fortunate to have located right here in our state, we will all need to come together to research and determine the best ways to both finance and implement an innovative single-payer model in Maryland. We are already spending far too much on health care, so in implementing a single-payer system in Maryland, upfront investments in the system should pay off in the long run. I am committed to exploring a single-payer system and other innovative, forward-thinking ways to reform our health care system to lower costs and expand access.  In the short-term, though, Maryland must take drastic action to stabilize our statewide insurance marketplace; the bipartisan one-year plan to charge insurance companies a one-time fee or $380 million in order to start a reinsurance fund would hold off premium increases.  Likewise, it should hopefully stop CareFirst from leaving the state's market.  A statewide individual mandate would also help in the absence of federal individual mandate enforcement.  This is the bare minimum we can do as we explore the possibilities for statewide single-payer or await a resurgent national Democratic wave to deliver single-payer in 2020.","The state should inject extra resources (for instance, state police resources for high-priority warrants) and set the stage for long-term crime reduction via social investments.  The state should not play the entire role envisioned by Governor Hogan; we should resist the urge to further militarize police or to return to the tired, zero-tolerance, mandatory-minimum approaches of the past.  Longer sentences may feel cathartic to levy, but certainty -- not severity -- of punishment is what actually deters future punishment.","My parents were small business owners, and I spent a fair amount of my childhood helping out at the register or just reading a book and watching my parents run their shop.  It wasn't easy for them.  Now, as a computer science teacher, I give kids the technical skills they need to go start businesses of their own -- perhaps business that will someday grow into something larger.  With a growing/aging population and growing need, the only way to pay for everything our community needs is to supercharge our business sector.  We have to grow our way out of this squeeze.  The state should use the Kirwan Commission to renew our commitment to middle-skill, new-collar jobs with high-quality apprenticeships so that we can fill gaps in our economy.  We should work to improve transit and education infrastructure to draw large businesses.  And finally, we should work with business community members to identify points of friction in their interaction with the state.","I enthusiastically support non-partisan redistricting measures like independent commissions for both state and federal lines.  I am sympathetic to the desire to elect more Democrats, but this is not the way to do it.  At the same time, the past several decades of American politics have made one thing abundantly clear.  While not all Republican legislators are unreasonable or disingenuous, Democrats are not, in general, bargaining with good-faith partners on the other side of the aisle. For this reason, I am nervous about unilaterally disarming. To do so would be both morally right and a pleasingly cathartic gesture of commitment to strong, representative democratic institutions. It would be a statement of confidence in the power of our side's ideas. But I worry that unilateral disarmament would be a strategic blunder and would forfeit the one bargaining chip that we do have in the fight to get Virginia to draw better maps. That's why I favor regional compacts that use interstate cooperation to trigger structural reforms, like then-Senator Raskin's national popular vote compact.",We should abolish the ten-day waiting period before questioning an officer suspected of excessive use of force.  Hearing boards should review decisions rendered by superiors rather than serving as the first step in the discipline process.  Civilians should have some say in the review process.,"1. Change the way healthcare providers prescribe opioids to require a medical history and a pain treatment plan and limiting initial acute pain prescriptions to a 5-day supply.  When that runs out, prescribers may issue a 30-day resupply.  Prescription painkillers are a critical gateway to street opioid addiction, and we have to reform our use patterns.  2. Invest in schools as the site of early access to health resources.  Young people struggling with addiction should be able to access services in the places where they are most comfortable and where they spend the most time.  3. Treat addiction as a public health issue, not a criminal issue; bring people struggling with addiction out of the shadows so they can get help.  4. Tackle issues of broad alienation and isolation via education and economic revitalization.","1) World-class public schools.  The Kirwan Commission's recommendations will arrive in late 2019, and the Assembly has one shot to make a series of funding and operational decisions that will govern an entire generation's experience in our schools.  I'll fight for funding increases that especially serve kids with need. I'll also weigh in on implementation and funding of statewide universal pre-K, career and technical education programs, new teacher recruitment/retention/promotion mechanisms, and the expansion of computer science courses to every high school in the state.  2) Transit investment.  We have to invest in public infrastructure that can move people to jobs and cultural institutions as safely, quickly, efficiently, and greenly as possible. I'll support Baltimore investment and DC Metro accountability measures (along with dedicated funding, which we achieved this session) and will also push the state to invest in BRT, strategic state road maintenance, and all-day, two-way MARC service.  3) Employment law. Economic growth does not have to be framed as a zero-sum game between management on labor.  Everyone benefits from robust wage growth; when we all do well, we all do better.  I'll support measures that encourage both small and large businesses, and I'll advocate for laws that keep our workers healthy and balanced.  4) Healthcare.  Healthcare costs and unexpected medical expenditures can ruin wage-workers' lives. Against the backdrop of the national dismantling of the Affordable Care Act, Maryland should implement its own individual mandate and take swift action to expand rate-setting to prescription drugs.","As advocated by Common Cause, the Public Information Act needs a pre-litigation appeal process.  And we should resist the urge to carve out exemptions under the law -- for example, police body camera footage.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

I have not decided whether to support recreational marijuana.,"Maryland has many options to further improve the health of the Chesapeake.  We can choose to control fertilizer runoff from suburban lands and agricultural fields by controlling things such as the use of lawn fertilizer and the spreading of poultry manure.  We also can do a better job managing development so that septic systems that leak into our waterways are controlled and development that ruins stream habitats is minimized.  I was the lead sponsor of a bill that was intended to limit the use of certain lawn fertilizers, but unfortunately that bill did not pass.  We need to foster broader awareness of the importance of the Bay and the steps needed to protect it or there will not be sufficient political will to take appropriate measures.",The rising cost of health care and health insurance is threatening the budgets of many Maryland families and businesses.  If healthcare becomes unaffordable it will expose us all to the high cost of ignoring medical problems and publicly provided emergency care.  This session I sponsored two major pieces of legislation.  One bill would authorize Maryland to seek a Section 1332 waiver from the federal government.  This would allow Maryland to implement a reinsurance program to stabilize the individual insurance market.  The second bill placed an 2.75% assessment on insurance companies to raise the funds needed to establish a state reinsurance program.   I also sponsored a bill that would create a prescription drug commission.  The commission would make recommendations to the legislature on how to limit excessive drug price increases.,"We should be ""one Maryland"" and Baltimore's issues are all of our concern.  We are looking into issues with the police force, school funding, criminal justice reform, and economic development.","Maryland has a strong business climate that is helped by good schools and vibrant communities.  We can foster more job creation with incentives such as job creation tax credits (and tax credits focused on manufacturing jobs).  We also need to make sure that our citizens are prepared for the available jobs through things like apprentice training, and career and vocational training.   The new medical marijuana law also will create various jobs in growing and dispensing this product.",Yes.  I co-sponsored such a bill many times in prior sessions and in this session.,The LEOBR may be used to shield officers that are abusing their authority.

These measures address expanding access to treatment, boosting overdose prevention efforts by changing doctor prescription practices, and increasing the availability of naloxone.  We also have funded schools and providers to teach about substance abuse.  Finally, I have advanced a bill that would require Maryland's public colleges to implement recovery programs.","Wage stagnation and weak job creation have caused increased income inequality.  To address this we have raised the minimum wage and are creating more vocational and training programs through the Department of Labor.  We also provided $10 million to help students pay for community colleges.  Finally, we expanded the earned income tax credit.","In 2015 the General Assembly amended the Public Information Act and required a final report from the Attorney General at the end of 2017.

(fine arts), cum laude, 1973, M.A. (fine arts), 1974.","A former art teacher, I began my career in government and politics as a Howard County community activist for slower growth and an adequate number of public schools. I served on Howard County Council from 1986 to 1994 and have served as delegate in Maryland's District 13 since 1994. I served as vice chair of the Health and Government Operations (HGO) Committee from 2007 to 2016 and have been HGO chair since 2017. Before that, I served on the Economic Matters Committee from 1995 to 2002, including as vice chair of the Science and Technology Subcommittee from 1999 until 2002. I also serve on the Rules and Executive Nominations Committee. Over the years, I have served on various committees related to health insurance, including the Joint Oversight Committee of the Maryland Health Benefit Exchange, the Task Force to Study Electronic Health Records, the Joint Legislative Task Force on Small Group Market Health Insurance, and the House Medical Malpractice Workgroup. I have sponsored numerous bills with the goal of making health care accessible and effective for Marylanders, including a 2001 bill to provide affordable prescription drug coverage to seniors. That bill was ultimately incorporated into a comprehensive health bill that became law. I was among the first legislators to begin advocating for electronic health records, including sponsoring a law passed in 2008 that allowed for electronic signatures. I also sponsored successful legislation halting the proposed conversion of CareFirst Blue Cross/Blue Shield to a for-profit company, and a subsequent bill establishing increased oversight of the CareFirst board of directors. I also sponsored a successful law in 2006 requiring public reporting of healthcare-associated infections rates in the state-mandated ""Hospital Report Card."" This year, I was a sponsor of legislation that created a reinsurance pool to help stabilize health insurance premiums.","Yes, as a former teacher, I understand the importance of quality public education for all students -- and the need to include sufficient money in the budget for them. The Kirwan commission concluded that Maryland's students are ""in the middle of the pack"" in the US and the world but that ""it is possible to build systems where essentially all students perform at a high level."" We are obligated to do that. I am just beginning to study the report and await the cost analysis. I am committed to working on and improving how we educate our state's children.  A small start would be using public funds exclusively for public education rather than siphoning off taxpayer money for private schools. We should also ensure that casino revenue is used for education, a step the General Assembly just voted to place on the ballot in November.","We have not reached the appropriate balance between roads and public transit. Highways and the regional beltways are still congested, and many people have no other way to get to work or stores than by car or complicated and long bus routes. I was pleased to vote for dedicated funding for the DC Metro and hope that we can look again at the Red Line funding. Letting private companies add beltway lanes and keep the toll money is the wrong approach, focusing too much on cars and exacerbating income inequality.  My personal goal for Howard County would be to improve public transit within the county and also better connect us to the rest of the state.","Yes. I have also been very involved with legalizing medical marijuana in Maryland and voted to decriminalize small amounts of marijuana (2014), to decriminalize marijuana paraphernalia (2015), and to override the governor's veto in 2016 of the paraphernalia law.","First, maintaining the federal Chesapeake Bay funding is critical. It has broad and bipartisan support in Congress and affects watershed projects in 7 states and the District of Columbia.  In addition, the state must continue to fund programs to stick to our ""pollution diet,"" including by helping farmers reduce soil and nutrient runoff from their land. We'll also need to ramp up focus on the suburbs and cities, where stormwater runoff has become the fastest and only growing source of watershed pollution. Through the combined efforts of the state, nonprofits, and community groups, we will need to slow polluted stormwater runoff through green infrastructure (trees, rain gardens, green roofs, etc.) – and educate residents about using less fertilizer and more native plants, installing rain gardens and conservation landscaping.  The state will also need to evaluate the 20-year-old Forest Conservation Act for possible updates. Although the House and Senate passed legislation to do this, differences weren't resolved before the end of the session.","As chair of the HGO Committee, Ive spent much of this session working to make meaningful health insurance available and affordable to all Marylanders. We were forced to address the President's decision to end critical federal payments to health insurance companies, followed by Congress's repeal of the individual mandate, which caused premiums to dramatically increase in the individual market.  We passed a stop-gap measure this year, establishing a state reinsurance pool that will compensate insurers for the most expensive patients in 2019, thereby helping to stabilize rates for everyone.  Longer term, we applied for a federal waiver to become eligible for additional federal reinsurance dollars over the next five years. We considered establishing a state individual mandate. Homeowners and automobile owners must buy insurance, and we are happy if we never have to use it. Our payments cover the unfortunate experiences of others – and we don't complain that we didn't have an accident or natural disaster. Sometimes, we need that insurance and are glad we have it. Very few people get through life without needing health insurance. Without healthy people paying into the pool, only the oldest and sickest patients seek coverage – making insurance unaffordable. Short of having a single-payer system, the individual mandate, coupled with a reinsurance fund, might be the two most important pieces of this complicated puzzle.","The root of most violent crime is the persistence of poverty, barriers to quality education and inadequate housing, along with a lack of access to health care and mental health and addiction services. State investment in those areas will be key to addressing violent crime. We also need to continue to strengthen gun safety laws.","Businesses want to operate – and families want to live – in a state that offers excellent public schools, colleges and universities;  well-paid teachers who are treated as professionals; an educated and trained workforce; good roads and transit; clean air and water; and safe neighborhoods. The more Maryland invests in these areas and services, the more we can attract businesses and well-paying jobs.","Independent redistricting commissions operating in all states would help ensure fair districts (that also don't dilute minority communities' voting strength) and a more responsive Congress. An Associated Press analysis of 2016 elections found that Republicans won as many as 22 additional U.S. House seats over what would have been expected, and, among the most populated states, there were three times as many seats with Republican-tilted U.S. House districts. The Brennan Center for Justice has similarly found that ""congressional maps are consistently biased in favor of Republicans,"" along with ""clear evidence that aggressive gerrymandering is distorting the nation's congressional maps,"" posing a ""threat to democracy.""  Gerrymandering, largely by the GOP, has created a Congress whose actions rarely reflect the will of voters (such as on gun-safety measures, health care or taxes). Voters are clamoring for fairly drawn districts across the country. Making registration and voting easier is also important.  I was pleased to vote in the General Assembly this year for legislation that allows residents to automatically register to vote at the DMV and other state agencies and for a ballot initiative that calls for same-day registration and voting.","The Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights was designed to protect officers from frivolous lawsuits. Maryland's LEOBR was enacted in 1974 and is considered among the most extreme in the nation.  Though I am not an expert in this area, it seems reasonable to reexamine and update policies periodically.   Communities want to know that police will treat them fairly – or be held accountable.","We need to treat opioid addiction and overdose as a public health crisis. The first step is prevention of future addicts. Last year, my committee (the House Health and Government Operations) helped craft and the General Assembly passed the Prescriber Limits of 2017 because of the soaring number of deaths linked to opioid addiction and overdoses. This requires health-care providers to prescribe the lowest effective dose of an opioid in a quantity no greater than the amount needed for the expected duration of acute pain, typically three days or fewer and rarely more than seven days. A bill passed this year requires health-care providers to advise patients about the benefits and risks of prescribed opioids. In addition, we need to continue efforts to make naloxone (Narcan) and treatment options readily available.   We have increased funding for treatment programs.","The state will need to address at least three key areas to address income inequality: *Education: Invest in public pre-k-12 education and provide affordable community college and trade schools, because education is the pathway to economic security;   *Improve public transit, so people won't have to rely on cars to get to work;  *Raise the minimum wage to $15/hour, setting a minimum wage that is a livable wage.  In addition, access to meaningful, affordable health care is critical.","Open meetings and public information laws are key to ensuring faith, accountability and public participation in government. Regarding public information laws: The General Assembly passed legislation establishing, in October 2015, the state Public Information Act Compliance Board – to review whether fees are ""unreasonable"" – and the position of Public Access Ombudsman, who can mediate disputes between agencies and those seeking information. The latest PIACB report makes no major recommendations other than considering a one-time fee waiver for indigent individuals requesting records  about themselves. The General Assembly also passed legislation in 2017 to strengthen the state's Open Meetings Act.  In its most recent report, the Open Meetings Compliance Board found that most violations occur through a ""misstep"" in applying the act rather than from disregard or lack of awareness, and it had no recommended amendments to the OMA at this time. Before making more changes, let's take some time to evaluate how these new measures are working.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

I have a Bachelor of Engineering in Civil Engineering (BE) from Hofstra University in New York.  I have a diploma from Saint James School, St. James, Maryland.","My professional background includes the position of President & CEO of a regional senior living and health care company with over 1,000 employees in six facilities in two states. I have worked in the construction industry for many years managing multi-million dollar projects in Maryland. I have performed business development for a Maryland based minority business enterprise (MBE) firm. And during college, I worked part time for a think tank consulting firm working on projects for the U.S. Army.","I do support the work of the Kirwan Commission. The main policy areas of the commission are: Early Childhood Education, High Quality Teachers and Leaders, College and Career Readiness Pathways, More Resources for at–risk Students and Governance and Accountability. I am especially an advocate for early childhood education. One of my heroes is Steny Hoyer. Congressman Hoyer created the Judith P. Hoyer Early Childhood Care and Family Education Centers, known as ""Judy Centers"", which coordinate services for children from the time they are born until they enter kindergarten. My grandfather used to tell me when I was in school, ""study hard because this education has to last you the rest of your life"". That is why I believe that we must attract the best possible teachers and pay them the best possible wage to give our children the best possible education. All of the recommendations of the commission have a price tag. We need to commit to funding public education including the Kirwan Commission reforms. The alternative is to have to pay and pay and pay for so many other problems that poor education breeds including many described in other questions in this article.","My district, 2B, incorporates the City of Hagerstown which is an area that has limited transit options and therefore we depend on our roads infrastructure. The Governor has not adequately funded the Highway User Revenue Fund for local jurisdictions like Hagerstown and Washington County. As a candidate, I do not necessarily have access to the information to determine whether the State has the resources to meet its transportation needs, but I do believe that we must look for new and innovative alternatives for transportation. Until then our current infrastructure needs to be improved such as the widening of Interstate 81.",No.,"I am a proponent of local-state-federal-private partnership efforts to restore and protect the Chesapeake Bay. The Bay is one of the most valuable natural resources in our country. Marine aquaculture, the business of working in and around the water is a very important part of our State's economy. I will work to increase the effort to repopulate the oysters in the Bay which help to filter unwanted nutrients that cause dead zones and impair our Maryland blue crab and indigenous fish.","The Democratic led Maryland legislature took great steps in the 2018 session to stabilize the Affordable Healthcare Act for Marylanders by establishing the Maryland Insurance Stabilization Fund and the Health Insurance Down Payment Escrow Fund. This was in response to the Republican led Congress working to strip the provisions of the Affordable Healthcare Act. One of the biggest challenges to access to affordable health care is the ever-increasing insurance premiums and deductibles. Previously I employed over 1,000 people and we struggled every day to cope with the cost of health insurance and what portion the employees paid. I will work to find ways to change the incentives so that providers and payers focus on wellness and prevention. Too many people are forced into high deductible plans that discourage them from seeing a doctor or seeking care. In the end this ultimately costs the health care system more money rather than ensuring that people get the care they need when they need it.","I support Mayor Catherine Pugh's ""Call to Action"" program to help reduce violent crime in Baltimore City. The State needs to have her back as she works to make Baltimore safe. We can work with the Pugh Administration to increase effective policing by regaining the trust between the community and the police. Baltimore is working to increase the number of sworn officers and improve their training as well as enhance the effectiveness of the Baltimore Police organization. By reducing the number of violent repeat offenders and getting illegal guns off of the streets, the violent crime could be significantly reduced. And finally, the Baltimore Police can focus on de-escalation to diffuse situations before they become deadly. I support Mayor Pugh's Administration's efforts to improve community engagement.","I would characterize Maryland's business climate as a struggle to balance the need to attract living wage jobs with giving those workers the protections and support that they and their families need. As a businessman who once ran a business with over 1,000 employees, I understand the delicate nature of that balance. Too far in one direction, and businesses who have a choice of where to locate may consider Maryland to be an unfriendly climate. However, we have seen many stories of states that do not look out for workers and the unsustainable situation that creates. For example, in West Virginia (a place that most agree is very conservative) it took a state-wide walk out to get teachers even a basic cost of living wage increase, which is now being replicated in similar states of Arizona and Oklahoma. To create more family-supporting jobs, I am in favor of more private investment in Maryland such as Kevin Plank's Port Covington project in Baltimore.","I believe that extreme partisan gerrymandering, such as they had in Pennsylvania, is bad for our country. There are many highly intelligent people who are, as we speak, trying to find a solution to extreme partisan gerrymandering. These include the former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder and even the United States Supreme Court, who are currently considering gerrymandering cases brought in Maryland and Wisconsin. So, I do not claim to have the answers that many others are working hard to find. In the end, however, we clearly need a national fix to the problem that has created so much gridlock that it keeps Congress from functioning properly.",I believe Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights adequately balances protections for both the police and the public.,"I will work to tackle the opioid crisis that is gripping our city. Too many families have lost loved ones to the opioid crisis, and every day that we don't act more people die. In Annapolis, I will fight to bring detox and treatment facilities to Hagerstown, expand opioid education programs in our middle and high schools, and help provide families with the life-saving medications.",This response assumes that this question is referring to income inequality between men and women.  I believe that it is unconscionable to pay one person more for the exact same work as another person only based on gender. Two people performing the exact same job should be paid the same regardless of whether they are a man or a woman. I am sure that my friends in the UAW Local 171 working on the production line making transmissions and engines at the Volvo / Mack plant in Hagerstown are making the same pay whether they are men or women. We must enforce the federal gender anti-discrimination laws and protect those laws from being undone by the current Administration.,Yes.,"Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

I have earned some college in Information Systems from Strayer University.  I began working on my Social Science degree, at University of Maryland University College (UMUC) in 2012.","In 2010, I served as President of the National Youth Rights Association, D.C. Chapter of the Greater Washington Area.  I worked for the United States Postal Service as a career city carrier in Alexandra, VA , from March 2013-June 2016.","I support the Call to Action as prescribed by the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education - with exceptions. I am committed to funding expanded access to Pre-K (regardless of household income and circumstances) so that children become students as early as possible. We must devote more resources to at-risk students, students with disabilities. and provide ESOL for students and parents. Most importantly we have to reduce classes sizes, employ culturally-competent educators who teach a culturally-relevant curriculum and not a standardized test. Funding to support what is needed is already available through a well-appropriated budget that prioritizes closing achievement gaps first. There has to be reforms and the answer is not limited to demanding more and more money. Fix the fund by fixing the budget and changing the Leadership.","I do not believe the Baltimore region is adequately served by transit. As a resident of Howard County, its difficult to get to downtown Baltimore - unless you own a car.  I believe the state has the resources to develop comprehensive plans to build a much needed common-sense mass transit system that connects the Baltimore-Washington area. We need to consider building a mass transit link before we continue with all this 'developing' - which has led to overcrowded schools and no access to real affordable housing.","Yes. I support the legalization of recreational marijuana because it has in-part contributed to the mass incarceration of black men. I also support a tax on the sale of recreational marijuana. I believe that the revenue should be considered as a funding source for rehabilitation services and programs in our prisons (along with a reformed criminal justice system) - to begin second chances while serving fair sentences. With a state-operated prison system that rehabilitates offenders intro productive citizens we could see a sustainability of economic growth, reduction in crime, and reduced dependency on welfare programs for lower-income families.","We need to make sure that every public trash can has a recycling bin next to it. Conventional farmers have to be fully educated on the 'best management practices' conservation practices which is helping farmers reduce and prevent runoff of nutrients, fertilizer and other resources into streams, rivers and the Bay - the ""pollution diet"".  Styrofoam needs to go. We need to do better at enforcement of some of the steps we've already taken. There's needs to be more accountability.","I believe in a single-payer healthcare system that will help to ensure each Marylander has coverage when he or she needs it, low-cost affordable prescription medication and a primary physician. Gaining access to affordable health care requires immigration reforms - to make sure and provide opportunity that anyone who is not a legal citizen is in a lawful status and authorized to work and contribute to our economy.","We should make sure that highly-effective programs like 'Safe Streets' have secured funding and accountability, to expand and to do more of the work that has helped to reduce violent crime.","Corporations are opening their doors, not paying livable wages, not investing back into their employees or local economy, raking-in profits, and paying their executives big bonuses adding up to millions and millions. In order to foster the creation of more family-supporting jobs, we have to move from a minimum wage to a livable wage that provides for a sustainable living, savings and benefits with real job protections. If you make a big profit, your hourly-workers should enjoy handsome paychecks and consistent scheduling. Their must be real reforms made to at-will employment in non-union workplaces.",Yes.,"No it doesn't adequately balance protections for police and the public - it seems to provide more excuses with less accountability for the police. Officers should not be allowed to use profanity when engaged with citizens, whatsoever. Officers should not allowed to antagonize citizens  or provoke situations.  Citizens need more protections in their rights to question their interaction with police, in any aspect.  Complaints should be welcomed with accountability and responsibility within a customer service approach. There is no real accountability for the actions of police officers. We must first make changes to the  Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights with the input of the people, then move towards customer service training.","The abuse of opioids is an unfortunate epidemic. Families and lives are literally being ruined daily. I'm prepared to be an advocate for policy and programs that educate our community about prescription drug-use safe practices. I will also support mental health programs that better address drug addiction and helps push recovering addicts towards healthy lifestyles. Opioid abuse is an extreme disservice to patients who are in need of the medication to reduce their symptoms. We have to be more vigilant about tracking and monitoring the use and frequency of the drug; and holding physicians and pharmacist more accountable. I am committed to advocate legislation and collaborate with our community stakeholders to develop a holistic approach to rid our communities, families, jobs, and property of drug abuse. Not forgetting to extend this work to the heroin epidemic.","While workers are actively demonstrating their skills at-work, employers are often under-compensating employees who don't hold a skill certification or degree (unskilled).  This contributes to income inequality. However, more often employers are not investing into their employees or their communities or recognizing their demonstration of undocumented skills .  We have to increase accessibility to skill certifications programs that can be presented equivalent to both the education and skill qualifications for skilled jobs. These programs must be made available in lower-income communities and should be based on the demonstration of skills and should not be limited by the requirement of a high school education.","No. Maryland, specifically Howard County and Baltimore County, has major transparency issues. The rules are being written, passed into policy, then broken.  I am committed to holding our government accountable at all levels. I believe in accessibility and transparency - both are equally important to the democratic process.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

In particular I support the push for universal Pre-K education for all students. I am committed to funding education reform through a combination of casino ""lockbox"" funding, revising funding formulas, and raising the percentage of state contributions across the board.","I support an ""all of the above"" approach to transportation including roads and transit, with a strong focus on investing more heavily in public transit. I was thrilled to see WMATA receive a dedicated funding commitment from all three local jurisdictions, but expanded transit with a focus on BRT is also needed in the fast-growing Upcounty region of Montgomery County. I was a supporter of the Red Line and was disappointed by Hogan's decision to withhold state funding. While BaltimoreLink is a step forward in the region's bus system, I do not believe it adequately serves the region.",I do not support the legalization of recreational marijuana but do support medical use.,"As a symbol of Maryland, the Chesapeake Bay is the nation's largest and also the dirtiest estuary. Cleaning the Bay should be an ongoing priority for Maryland, which is why the Trump Administration's decision to stop funding for the Chesapeake Bay is irresponsible and outrageous. The Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure we must protect for our future generations. The State Department of Natural Resources' Oyster Management Program has helped restore the oyster stock through sanctuaries in the Bay because the oysters are natural protectors of clean water with their unique function as the ""sanitary workers"" of the Bay. The DNR program to limit the harvest of female blue crabs has also led to a healthy come-back and increase of crab population. We should continue and enhance such programs with appropriate staffing and resources.  While much more needs to be done to clean up the Bay at an accelerated rate, Maryland has been generally doing a good job (compared to other states) in the Bay cleanup efforts. I support Maryland's Storm Water Management program to reduce storm water runoff into the Bay. In particular, I support Maryland's current phosphorus-management program that help farmers calculate how much chicken manure they can safely spread on their fields to limit the amount of the run-off into the Bay. I also support the State's current program to reduce lawn fertilizer runoff into the Bay that leads to algae growth and kill natural habitat.",I believe in monitoring and regulation for drug corporations and the formation of drug cost review commission. Drug costs should never be so high that only the highest earners can access  life-saving medicine.,"Last year when the federal government passed over Baltimore for National Public Safety Partnership funding it was a blow to the city. The state needs to invest heavily in public safety programs, community policing tactics, and outreach to at risk youth to address the growing violent crime statistics in Baltimore.","Maryland is improving in our business climate but our business and jobs growth should be stronger for a state with unrivaled institutional and human assets. We need to do more to minimize duplicate processes and unintended consequences in government regulations that either hinder business growth or sends an unwelcoming message to entrepreneurs and businesses that want to put down their roots here. We need to be more competitive with Northern Virginia, especially, in our ability to attract and retain talent and investments so our residents don't have to drive long distance for good jobs and so our quality of life from schools to roads to senior care can be funded with an expanding tax base.","We should adopt a new way of drawing district lines by moving away from letting the State Legislature create districts and exploring the creation of an independent commission. Anytime elected officials are drawing district lines, there will be the temptation to create boundaries to bolster themselves or their party. I believe in order to have truly equitable districts we need an independent commission armed with the proper data and mathematical modeling tools.",I do not believe the Officers Bill of Rights balances protection for the police and the public. I support the creation of civilian oversight committees to give citizens a voice in police investigations.,"The opioid crisis is affecting communities all across Maryland. As usage spins out of control, we need to focus our efforts on stopping the abuse of painkiller prescriptions and make sure treatment is readily available. I support establishing new guidelines on prescribers, increasing funding for treatment programs to allow all residents, regardless of economic background to receive help, and securing funding to make sure all municipalities have Naloxone on hand.","I believe we should have a multi-pronged approach with statewide minimum wage increase, heavy investments in workforce training to be ready for growing industries of the future that bring quality middle wage jobs, and make it easier for residents to start businesses to build asset and help their communities. In order to truly address income inequality, we need to provide our citizens with the tools and systemic support such as a strong entrepreneurial support network, which is what I have been championing and working on.","Maryland's Public Information Act and open meetings laws provide our citizens with strong access to oversee government activities. I support the creation of a central agency in charge of PIA requests and eliminating  ""reasonable fees"" from requests.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

She has over thirty years of program, project, group management and team leadership experience in establishing and overseeing program management offices (PMO) for commercial and government agencies, including the IRS, Fannie Mae, and IBM.","Yes, I support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education (Kirwin Commission).  The commission's recommendations are data-informed and comprehensive.  Therefore, I supported HB 1415 which starts implementation of Kirwan Commission recommendations to improve teacher recruitment, greater resources for low-income schools, greater options for career technical education.  The Casino Lockbox bill would dedicate casino money to supplement K-12 educational initiatives.","I support a robust and well-connected mass transportation system which is important to address access to employment; and reduce traffic congestion.   A comprehensive State transit plan is needed that incorporates assessing funding and infrastructure needs from a regional perspective.   As a year of implementation approaches, assessing the effectiveness of the BaltimoreLink overhaul is warranted, especially with connectivity between bus-to-rail.  To address the funding needs for transportation efforts,  during the 2018 Legislative Session, HB 372 passed which allocates $178 million to the Maryland Transit Authority (MTA) over the next three years to be used for the Baltimore Metro Subway system or other MTA systems (MARC commuter trains or commuter buses). Furthermore, the MTA is required to conduct a comprehensive assessment of all of its capital assets, such as Baltimore buses, MARC locomotives, and the tracks and cars of its Metro and light rail systems.  The outcome will help highlight the resources needed to meet the State's transportation needs.","Not yet. While I support efforts to decrimalize small amount of marijuana for personal use and medical marijuana usage, before enacting State legislation to allow recreational marijuana, the State needs to ensure the medical marijuana industry in fully functional with leveling-the-playing field for access to the industry; and fostering reasonable competition with price stabilization for patients. Until the federal government moves to legalize medical marijuana, state tax policy for business owners is hampered.  Consequently, taxing and regulation of recreational marijuana will be problematic.  Once Maryland gets medical marijuana operation, regulation, and taxing under control, efforts to move towards recreational use of marijuana can be explored.","In response to a President Trump Administration that is implementing regressive environmental policy, I supported efforts by the Maryland General Assembly to require the Governor to join the U.S. Climate Alliance of states committed to reducing greenhouse gas emission and not withdraw from the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative without approval from the State Legislature.   To protect Maryland's waters and coastline businesses,I  supported legislation to establish a liability for an entity that causes an oil or gas spill while engaged in offshore drilling activity.  The agriculture sector in my District understands that cleaning up the Chesapeake Bay is an important priority for the State. I champion bay clean-up and maintenance efforts including the Stormwater Management program to reduce erosion and sediment control, implementation of cover crops and use of manure transported from the Eastern Shore. Future legislative efforts are needed to incentivize greater use of technology such as software applications by Monsanto that help farmers have sustainable food growth while protecting nature resources that can survive environmental changes; this can be achieved with subsidies, grants, or tax-breaks that enable more farmers to utilize decision-support systems that adhere to our State's environmental objectives, including reporting requirements.","Despite the Trump Administration's sabotage of Obamacare, Maryland ranks among the top of all states in new-enrollees, young people signing up for coverage, and lowest number of uninsured.  However, more efforts are needed to increase access to quality health care for all Marylanders.  I support legislation to keep insurance costs down, to stabilize rates, and provide more health provider choices.  For the 2018 Session, I supported Reinsurance Program (HB 1795) which allows insurance companies to subsidize the cost of care for high-risk individual market enrollees; and Health Care Access Program (HB1782) allows collection of suspended federal fees; and requires a study to explore long-term options to stabilize individual market rates.","The state should view this pervasive culture of violence, as a health issue; and implement a multi-facet approach with addressing this disease using data-driven, best practices that focus on causes, acute and long-term treatment, and prevention of violent crimes.  In the 2018 Legislative Session, the state has started some progressive efforts to address gun violence in Baltimore, but more efforts are needed.    The state should foster via incentives a collaborative effort involving academia, medical professionals, business, law enforcement, Corrections, Judiciary, and community advocates to develop a comprehensive strategic approach to addressing violent crime in Baltimore, and throughout the state.","Maryland's is a great place for business with its educated workforce and educational institutions capable of providing training and certifications to realign employee skills to business needs; more collaboration between business, government, and schools is needed to align goals.  Maryland has a good transportation infrastructure to facilitate access a workplace.  With more comprehensive transportation plans and dedicated funding to implement, access to quality jobs is improved for more working families.  With efforts to improve public education, increase affordable housing, increase workforce development, provide recreational options, and reduce crime, Maryland is a more attractive place to live than neighboring states.","Yes, I support a non-partisan, independent body to draw legislative and congressional district maps after each census. Unfortunately, issues with redistricting has put Maryland in the national spotlight; and efforts to remedy apparent issues aren't forthcoming.   Due to the national implication of redistricting results, I support a regional approach involving multiple states that will use the same independent body to redraw the boundaries.","The intent of the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights (LEOBR) is to provide a uniformed level of due process for Law Enforcement officers accused of wrongdoing which provides reasonable protections for law enforcement without avoiding appropriate discipline and limiting transparency to the public.  Until Law Enforcement works more aggressively to self-discipline itself to rid its ranks of ""bad apples"" and proactively works to restore public trust in Baltimore and others were community trust is erroded, there will always be public outrage about too much police protection under LEOBR when allegations of police misconduct surface.  In such cases, efforts are needed to increase transparency and civilian oversight.","For the 2018 Legislative Session, efforts continue to address the opioid overdose crisis including - a behavioral health crisis response grant program that awards funding to local behavioral health organizations to expand capabilities of crisis response programs and services such as  mobile crisis teams, 24/7 walk-in services, crisis residential beds, and other crisis response programs.  Other legislation requires pharmaceutical drug companies to file reports of suspicious orders of opioids to the Attorney General's office in addition to federal government reporting. I support more efforts to limit use of opioids by medical professionals for pain management; greater education and public service campaigns targeted to youth and adults on the dangers of substance-abuse and drug addiction.","I support state policies that level-the-playing field  in education,  employment, housing, and career mobility, especially policy to eliminate poverty by addressing impediments to upward mobility via training, certification, and apprenticeships; eliminating gender-biased hiring practices; and more mentoring programs to develop a pipeline of diverse corporate managers.","Yes, I believe Maryland's Public Information Act (PIA) and open meeting laws are adequate.  Maryland's PIA grants residents access and rights to information about government activities without unnecessary cost and delay.  This is essential for a democratic government to ensure public trust.  Maryland's PIA applies to all three branches of Maryland state government as well as local government entities.  Unfortunately, most residents are not familiar with the process to request information; or understand the scope of information access.  Likewise, many residents do not take advantage of the open meetings laws, especially related to Law Enforcement reviews.  This may be an areas in which community groups and advocates can educate residents on this process.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

Preschool should be available to all at a discounted rate. At-risk students should receive the help they need to help them succeed. Teachers should be compensated at a higher rate. High school diplomas should help prepare students better for college. Lastly, the public needs to be given the confidence that funding is making a difference in education.","Studies need to be completed to see if the Baltimore area is adequately served.

The health of the bay impacts every single one of us. We need to protect it at all costs.,Healthcare is tricky. There's not an easy answer or fix. I think there should be more research with community involvement to see what would fit our state the best.,"We should support education in school age children to help prevent violence. If children are given opportunities at an early age, the streets become significantly less important to them.","We need to offer incentives to encourage small, family-run businesses. Opening a business should be supported. There have been way too many closures of small businesses in our state.",Gerrymandering is a huge issue in our political climate. I do agree that an independent body needs to re-draw the maps.,Law enforcement officers need to be respected by our communities. The officers must hold themselves at a high standard and be a true public servant. I would have to do more research to see how it balances protections and if it needs revision.,"I am very well versed in this topic. As a Paramedic, I see and treat people dealing with this crisis. My thoughts for improving this crisis is to provide more back end support. There are a lot of people that want help. There are only so many beds and places that they can be offered treatment.

,YES,state-house,42B,Tim Robinson,Robinson,10/29/1952,Timonium,Republican,Baltimore County,http://www.robinsonfordelegate.com,RobinsonForDelegate,,http://surveygizmoresponseuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/fileuploads/296249/4297291/253-7f7eef427bfb7d1a94a63d06a0afd7dd_Tim_headshot_larger_at_statehouse.jpg,Medical Doctor,Anesthesiologist  Former President York Road Anesthesia Associates Former President Maryland Society of Anesthesiologists Former General Practitioner U.S. Public Health Service,"The preliminary report has 59 separate recommendations in an 80 page report.  In general, I support a comprehensive effort to evaluate and strengthen the public education system in Maryland.   A crucial issue for parents and students is transparency and accountability in how money and resources are spent.  We allocate tremendous resources to education, and need to do a better job with what we have before we add huge new resources. Education is among the most crucial responsibilities of the state government, as massive state funding of both K-12 and higher education indicate.  In the projected budget for 2019 education spending is slated at $14.7 billion dollars, 33% of the $44.4 total budget, slightly edging out health, at $14.5 billion, as the largest issue in the budget. We need to figure out how to spend that 33% more wisely, better supporting both teachers and students.","Revenue derived from gas taxes should primarily be used for road and bridge infrastructure, the dominant form of transportation in the state, upon which every Marylander depends.   Where workable, we also need to support mass transit, while understanding that it works best only when transporting between areas of high density housing/ residences and areas of high density employment or services.   The Red Line was not a good use of resources, but when we can identify projects that will make effective use of resources, we should support them.","I believe recreational marijuana will eventually become legal in Maryland, and that we must prepare to minimize any destructive impact on the general public.  Multiple states have legalized recreational marijuana, and we must look at their experiences to determine the best way forward.   We must find effective ways to evaluate driving under the influence.   Perhaps most crucially, we need to target tax revenue generated from sales, for treatment of all addictive behaviors; gambling, drugs, etc.","The Chesapeake Bay is in the process of healing from many decades of over use and abuse.  We have made a good start, and need to continue protecting the Bay, and to encourage federal assistance.   An enormous challenge to the Bay is the state of sediment behind the Conowingo Dam.  Governor Hogan has begun the process of determining how to protect theBay and removing sediment.  We need to continue that effort.","The just passed bipartisan bill assessing health insurers addresses the steep rises in premium costs for Marylanders.  Instead of a narrow group of insured paying the whole tab for the high cost of covering those with pre-existing conditions, the cost is spread much more widely.   We have decided as a state that we will provide health insurance for all regardless of their state of health, and those costs need to be spread widely, not narrowly on residents in the individual marketplace as is currently the case.   In addition, we can initiate a consortium of nearby states to make a common application for health insurance carriers to underwrite coverage.  A single common application would make it easier and more affordable for insurers to offer coverage in Maryland.  The resultant increase in choice and competition would be an advantage for consumers.   We also need to allow consumers wider latitude in choosing the scope and type of their coverage. Additionally, we need to employ tools to ensure patients have ""skin in the game"", that they are incentivized to use healthcare wisely and frugally,lowering the cost of healthcare in general.","Governor Hogan has done an excellent job of offering support to the city, while encouraging Mayor Pugh and her administration to continue to aggressively search for answers.  The just completed legislative session has mandated longer sentences for repeat violent offenders.  Crimes involving guns need to be prosecuted as gun crimes, not pled down to lesser charges.   We also need to support alternatives to incarceration, with early intervention to break the progression from petty crime to more serious and violent crime. Education and job opportunities are important in curtailing the temptation of crime.","Maryland had been historically unfriendly to business for decades prior to the Hogan Administration.  We were ranked 49th among states, with significantly higher business tax rates that nearby competitor states, with oppressive business regulations, and a crazy quilt of forms and permits.  This is improving, but we need to continue our progress.   The keys to improving the creation of family supporting jobs is to to provide a well educated, well prepared work force.  This requires we do a better job of educating our students, both to move forward in higher education, as well as to pursue careers in professions that require training or apprenticeships rather than college. We also need to lower the tax rates in Maryland to compete with less highly taxed surrounding states.","Absolutely.  Maryland wants and needs an independent, non-partisan commission on redistricting.   New districts should draw heavily on continuity of communities, geographic continuity, and with a strong emphasis on minimizing changes from census to census.   Voters should be able to identify their district from election to election, rather than knowing their district was chosen to give an advantage to a political party or politician.","The law enforcement community across the nation, and especially in Baltimore, has been under attack the last several years.  There is a perception in the media, and in some communities, that police officers are guilty until proven innocent.  We need to support the police, as the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights does well.  At the same time we must continue to weed out bad actors in the departments.   Law enforcement is an incredibly difficult job, requiring great patience, tolerance of danger, and split second decision making.  We have seen the results of the constant second guessing of the police in the stratospheric level of homicides and violent crime in Baltimore.   There is clearly a problem in Baltimore City recruiting new police officers, with a large percentage of applicants not passing the background check and the entrance exams.  We need better outreach to city students to encourage better, more qualified applicants.   The body camera program is an effective part of the solution.  Both officers and citizens have a tendency to act more civilly when they know they are being recorded.","The current crisis is due to a number of factors, and took many years to develop.  There are no quick fixes,  Among the solutions are: Education of on the real dangers of narcotics, and in particular of super potent versions like fentanyl and carfentanyl mixed in with heroin.  This needs to be done at schools, doctors offices, pharmacies and the media. Continued encouragement of physicians to use lower doses with smaller  prescriptions as appropriate when using narcotics in treatment of acute pain from injury or surgery. The use of narcotics for treatment of both acute and chronic pain needs to be carefully assessed by both the treating physicians and by patients, with an eye toward treatment with non-narcotic alternatives when feasible.   Naloxone , or Narcan, needs to be widely available for treatment of overdose.   Treatment options for addiction need to be available.  If recreational marijuana is legalized, tax revenue must be sequestered for addiction treatment.   Continued oversight of prescriptions to monitor over prescribing, while understanding the suffering patients in pain endure.  Strong legal action against dealers in street narcotics. Continued teach for non-narcotic pain treatments.","The most important thing the state can do to address income inequality is to pursue equality of opportunity.   In order for Marylanders to have equal opportunity, we need to ensure a better business climate, favorable to the growth of good, well paying jobs.   We need to ensure regulations protect the community rather than handicapping business growth. Equally, we must have quality education for all Marylanders.  This allows opportunity, and attracts business growth.  Education may be of all different types and qualifications- but quality education means opportunity.","The state's Public Information Act and the Open Meetings Act represent an attempt by the legislature to balance the need and desire of the public to obtain information from the state and local governments, with rights of privacy and need to conduct some deliberations in private.  The acts cannot and do not always ensure the ability of Marylanders to adequately oversee all government actions. There are times when access or information should legally be provided, but is denied.  There are penalties prescribed in the laws, but they are minor and rarely if ever used. The lawcannot account for all actions taken by government representatives, and are clearly a compromise.  Both acts support the withholding of information or access to meetings at times, for specific reasons with which a petitioner may not agree.   A potential partial relief would be to allow elected officials access to closed meeting and information, though this does not address the issue of timeliness of notice for meetings.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

I was disappointed that nothing was accomplished on the funding formula.  This is particularly frustrating for my county as we are dealing with declining enrollment. I appreciate the work that has been done and I firmly believe in getting much more flexibility and innovation in our school system.  We need to focus on true workforce skills so that our students will be equipped for success in college or in the workforce.   I believe we must put great emphasis on incorporating computer science and programming in K-12.  I believe we should track the success of P-Tech and expand that program throughout the state so that every jurisdiction has those opportunities for our students.   I also support expanding our career and tech schools and programs.  We need  to expand access to education in the trades and providing pipelines of apprenticeships and internships in those fields.,I think that historically there has not been an appropriate balance between roads and transit.  For far too long the emphasis has been on transit at the expense of areas like Carroll County. We have needed expansion for Route 32 for more than 10 years.  I appreciate Governor Hogan's approach of moving forward with every jurisdiction and their transportation priorities.  That is a fair and balanced approach. I believe that Baltimore will have success with BaltimoreLink.  From the briefings I have received on this initiative it will be focused on customer service and is making the commitment to ensure these routes make sense and are timely.  The Red Line cost was skyrocketing into the billions.  I appreciate Governor Hogan looking for a more reasonable way to address those issues while keeping the entire state in his mind rather than all of the transportation funding going to just a few jurisdictions.,I do not support legalization of recreational marijuana.  At this point in time there is no technology available for law enforcement to determine if drivers are impaired by use of the drug.  I feel that we need to be very focused on keeping our roads safe and I have great concerns over increased use of this drug and the resulting increase in dangerous conditions on our roads.,I believe that we have already been doing is sufficient.  The Bay has improved with the work that has been ongoing.  One of the major issues is runoff that comes into our waterways from the Susquehanna and neighboring states.  The other issue is Baltimore City and the lack of sufficient infrastructure improvements that would prevent the constant issue of polluted water being leaked into the waterways.,"I believe that the Affordable Care Act has been a dismal failure.  It has resulted in skyrocketing costs with no end in sight.  I believe the mandate and penalty should be eliminated for good.  I believe we need to open up the insurance market nationwide and empower people to purchase the coverage they feel would be best for their families.  Free market solutions and options should drive down the costs.    We should also allow trade organizations to be treated as a qualified ""group"".  This would allow groups such as realtors, NFIB, etc. to get better rates for their members.  This must be dealt with as soon as possible because insurance is becoming completely unaffordable.",I believe the two crime bills we just passed this session will provide excellent tools to assist Baltimore City in reducing crime.  Baltimore City must step up and do everything in its power to address crime.  We need mandatory minimum sentences for the most violent offenders. We need judges who impose proper sentences on repeat offenders to keep them off the streets and unable to terrorize neighborhoods.  Baltimore is a great city but it has become a national disgrace.,"I think the business climate has improved somewhat during Governor Hogan's first term. However we continue to push job killing initiatives such as the one size fits all mandatory sick leave law.  I hear from small businesses almost every day who are really struggling with the lack of flexibility and cost of implementing this law.   Maryland lawmakers need to stop micro-managing private business.  We need to reduce corporate tax rates so that businesses will have more capital to grow and hire people.  The more we do to foster a positive business environment, businesses will feel confident to invest and grow their firms.  As they increase their profits everyone will benefit with job creation and wages.  Helping businesses will result in more individuals working, paying taxes and spending money in our state.  When businesses win, everyone wins.",I support this 100%.  It is long overdue and will be the only fair way of drawing districts moving forward.  We need to get politics out of this process.  It should be bipartisan and transparent.,I support the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights as it stands in law.,I believe that under Governor Hogan's leadership every jurisdiction has been given additional resources to help combat this terrible problem.  I know that more treatment beds are desperately needed and that would be my main focus to help get treatment for more people who truly want to overcome this addiction. We need to continue to work with the medical community to crack down on the prescription of these powerful drugs so that people do not become addicted to the point of resorting to heroin use. Additional money for treatment and treatment facilities is something that should be a priority for those already addicted. Education of the dangers of these drugs should be a focus starting in elementary school.  Streamlining the access to treatment services should be a focus in every jurisdiction so that families struggling with this issue knows what is available to help them combat this problem.,A rising tide lifts all boats.  We need to create a positive and supportive business climate in the state.  As we give businesses tools to be successful and to grow it will result in more jobs and more opportunities for everyone.  If our businesses succeed and create wealth that will result in increased wages for every employee and new job creation for those not already employed.  We need to stop passing inflexible laws that are hurting job creation.,I believe in transparency at all levels of government.  I support our current laws and will continue to support initiatives that provide additional transparency.  The citizens should have full access to government operations at all times.  We work for the citizens.,"Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

Requiring the State to provide universal access to public and private prekindergarten for all four-year olds and low-income three-year olds is of particular interest to me because of my efforts in this area.  When we raise more money for public schools, I would vote for a more progressive way of doing so than the current reliance on lottery or slots revenues.","I supported the Red Line Project, and I would support similar projects in the future to increase mass transit options in and out of Baltimore City. Funding can be achieved by appropriate distribution of existing resources.","Yes. We need to build upon and learn from the experiences of other states with recreational marijuana, as well as our own experience with medical marijuana. Legalized recreational marijuana would provide a significant revenue source for the State. Legalization would also result in better outcomes in our criminal justice system because a disproportionate number of young African-American males are arrested and charged with marijuana possession.","I introduced and defended on the House floor the legislation giving the Attorney General the authority to sue to protect Marylanders from harmful federal policies, including misguided and illegal actions by the Environmental Protection Agency.  In 2015, I was the primary sponsor of legislation to provide financial assistance to farmers for state or local watershed implementation plans associated with the Chesapeake Bay total maximum daily load limits. If re-elected, I would introduce similar legislation to provide funding assistance to farmers for pollution management.","Increasing access to health insurance coverage and boosting enrollment, especially for low-income and vulnerable residents, is essential. I have supported efforts to protect our state's current health insurance marketplace, which is composed of public and private payers and has seen dramatic increases in enrollment since the passage of the Affordable Care Act. The Maryland Health Benefit Exchange recently reported that 81,553 individuals purchased insurance on the Exchange in 2014; in 2018, that number nearly doubled, to 153,571. Enrollment in Maryland's Medicaid program has increased by nearly 300,000 individuals.   I support efforts to protect and build on these existing programs. I am concerned that regulatory actions taken by the Trump Administration and legislation approved by the Republican-led Congress could discourage individuals from purchasing health insurance and thus destabilize the market. Our response, House Bill 1782, seeks to stabilize the individual health insurance market by requiring that, for calendar year 2019, the State will recoup the health insurance provider fee that otherwise would have been assessed under ​§​ 9010 of the Affordable Care Act.​ I was a co-sponsor of this bill.","A cultural shift must occur in the Baltimore Police Department; accountability will make that happen. An important step was taken this session with the enactment of SB 1099/HB561, that will set up a state commission with subpoena power to investigate allegations of Baltimore police corruption.   Additionally, I supported legislation this session to provide a $3.6 million increase in funding for Safe Streets, a proven reducer of gun violence and an important facilitator between the BPD and communities. Safe Streets stops the spread of violence in communities by using the strategies associated with disease control, the Abell Foundation concluded.  It detects and interrupts conflicts, identifies and treats the highest risk individuals, and changes social norms.","Maryland has one of the best educated and trained workforces in the country, but those educated workers are not equally distributed around the State.   More family-supporting jobs will be created over the long term by providing a better educated workforce so that companies with high paying jobs will want to locate in Maryland.   To further this long-term goal, I have championed funding of  universal pre-k. Race to the Tots was the name Senator Bill Ferguson and I gave to our 2013 legislation creating a competitive grant program to stimulate innovation and expand access to high-quality early childhood education.  A grant program was enacted the next year.    On the other end of the education spectrum, I worked with Freeman Hrabowski, President of UMBC, in 2014 to create a tech internship program, where the State of Maryland pays part of the salary for a summer internship with a start-up. This session, I worked with Governor Hogan to fund the program and expand it to larger companies, like Amazon, as well as state and local governments. These types of programs make our business climate a long-term winner.",I support a new process consistent with the holdings in the cases which will be decided by the Supreme Court later this year. We need a constitutionally sound redistricting process in every state that adheres to a national standard.,"In the wake of the death of Freddie Gray, I supported House Bill 1016 (2016), which made changes to the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights (LEOBR). These changes included a Community Program Fund to assist local law enforcement agencies in establishing community programs and agencies of local government in establishing violence intervention programs.  The most important change in this law was the reconstitution of the Police Training Commission as an independent Maryland Police Training and Standards Commission. This body now requires substantial further training in de-escalation and sensitivity.  HB 1016  also made a number of changes that make it easier for citizens to use the police complaint process. This is a continual process of revision.  Under Attorney General Sessions, the. Department of Justice has signaled that it is not interested in enforcing consent decrees on police departments. However, I still believe that the enforcement mechanisms in the consent decree process are an important first step in addressing police violence and constitutional violations.  I would give credence to the recommendations of the monitor in the consent decree process if he felt that the LEOBR needed to be changed as the consent decree process continues.","I support the approach taken by the General Assembly of increasing funding for a variety of programs aimed at improving access to substance abuse treatment and behavioral health crisis services but also closely monitoring the flow of prescription opioids into communities.  I introduced House Bill 1092, which  will fund a program for local jurisdictions to apply for state grants to establish or expand behavioral health and addiction crisis services.","A continued commitment to a better education for all students is the long term answer, with a near term goal of fully funding the Kirwan Commission recommendations. Additionally, the State of Maryland should move towards an equitable tax system that relies mostly upon a progressive income tax instead of on regressive sales taxes or lottery and gaming revenues to fund the State budget. I have also strategized with advocates for the Earned Income Tax Credit about expanding this benefit for eligible families and single individuals.",The actions of the Trump administration demonstrate the necessity of the free press for a well informed electorate.  Enabling the public to be better informed about the operation of our government is the standard I will use to judge any legislation that seeks to improve our Public Information Act and open meetings law.,"Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

That sparked a 20 year career in public service, where I managed renewable energy programs at USAID and the Department of Energy, served Senators Tom Harkin (D-IA) and Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ) as a legislative aide, drove successful advocacy campaigns for Middle East peace at J Street and Ploughshares Fund, and served as the Obama Administration's Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Legislative Affairs (House). I also ran for Congress in 2016 in Maryland's 8th Congressional District, after which I was elected to serve the Town of Chevy Chase one year ago as one of its five Council Members.  I am currently a Visiting Fellow at Carnegie Mellon University's Graduate School of Public Policy in Washington, DC, a foreign affairs consultant, and a frequent progressive national security commentator on MSNBC.","As a certified elementary school teacher who taught in the Peace Corps, and the father of three daughters who attend the Montgomery County Public Schools (MCPS), I am deeply committed to the success of our school system. While we will not know the Commission's final recommendations until after the election, we do know that the MCPS system, which receives about 12% of state capital funding while accounting for nearly 18% of Maryland's school population and 40% of its school enrollment growth, is not receiving its fair share of the state's revenue. Both the State and County have roles to play in meeting per-pupil spending and I would advocate for cost-sharing between the two that keeps pace with rising enrollment.   I will fight to grow the MCPS budget through a multi-faceted approach that will raise revenues in order to grow the State's overall education budget, secure those gains in an Education Fund, and tie funding to enrollment growth. Such an approach would smooth out the financial costs to MCPS associated with enrollment spikes by creating a consistent supplemental funding source, while also addressing base budget needs.   I will also press for a State Constitutional amendment to direct casino revenues to supplement the State's education budget – particularly for capital investment - and propose a mathematical formula that keeps pace with our school's needs. This would help fund the reform Commission's recommended reforms and secure public education funding for the long term.","Transportation is a quality of life issue that affects every Marylander. However, Governor Hogan has long neglected our state's transportation infrastructure, choosing now as a time – in an election year – to propose vast sums of new spending with hardly any community involvement or transportation expert planning behind it. I do not have confidence that his plan is either financially feasible nor makes sense for north-south commuters on I-270. This proposal also comes in a vacuum, rather than as part of a comprehensive regional transportation plan -- something that should be required before any such significant investment - however much needed - is made.   My family and I have lived in Montgomery County for over 10 years. I've taken the Metro to work most days and personally understand the frustrations that many have with our public transportation and automobile traffic. And as a Town Council Member in Chevy Chase, I have engaged my constituents on issues related to the Purple Line and dealt with the Hogan Administration's botched rollout of that massive infrastructure project.   We can and must do better. To do so, I would work to secure dedicated, stable funding for major transportation projects. I would advocate for competition and innovation in transportation to get better results out of the money that we currently invest. And I would prioritize spending funds for environmental impact studies and safety reviews for all projects, so that we ensure that we get it right.","I support a structured pathway for marijuana legalization and oppose federal efforts to roll back recent gains towards this objective. It should be decriminalized and access to medical marijuana should be both simple and accessible. In addition, marijuana businesses should be able to operate without fear and a portion of the tax revenue obtained from these businesses should be dedicated towards researching the impacts of marijuana and other drug use.","I strongly support regional and statewide efforts to both protect and clean up the Bay, as these efforts require multiple stakeholders to take action for the Bay to become truly clean. In particular, I would focus my efforts on strengthening wastewater treatment. To do so, first, I would work to reduce nitrogen loads flowing into the Bay from Maryland by sponsoring legislation to fund nutrient removal technology upgrades for sewage treatment plants. Second, I would sponsor legislation to fund septic connections for already upgraded treatment plants within the scope of Maryland's State Watershed Implementation Plan. We should not drop any programs to clean up the Bay until it is certifiably clean, and in Annapolis, I will strongly support efforts to protect the Bay.   Our communities, not polluters, should come first. Therefore, environmental quality in our communities should be judged by how communities are being impacted by pollution, not just by how much pollution each individual emitter creates. A holistic understanding of pollution levels in a community must be a prerequisite for any permitting decision, to ensure that the community impacts of the pollution are the first measurable criteria for regulation. I would push the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) to establish a baseline level of acceptable pollution levels in a community prior to deciding upon permits. And I would then press the MDE to only provide permits that add up to that level, and not beyond.","I have had successful surgery and had health coverage, so I recovered without fear of financial collapse. No one should have to live in such fear, which is why Maryland needs a single-payer system. Yet because of the federal repeal of the individual mandate, many Marylanders live in such fear. I will fight for the state to backfill funding for Medicaid expansion to ensure that that doesn't occur. After that, we should consider banning private insurance that fails to meet the standards of the original Affordable Care Act and establishing the legal existence of a single insurance pool to which all Maryland citizens who are financially able will contribute. These would be the first steps toward creating a public option through which the State of Maryland could help shape the ultimate realization of a national and universal public health care program.","Naturally I would look to Baltimore-area legislators for leadership on this issue. That being said, I am a big believer in community policing. I would support police officer training that is developed, taught and sustained with trusted community partners who directly represent the neighborhoods they patrol. I also favor emphasizing de-escalation measures in police training, believing that the use of force should be an absolute last resort.    A major component of community policing is for the police to take proactive steps towards learning the cultural dynamics at work in their communities, in order to make better-informed choices when interacting with people from different backgrounds. This training should be provided early in an officer's career and sustained through active partnerships with immigrant rights groups and local leaders. I would also push police departments to hire officers that reflect the racial, ethnic, and religious makeup of the communities where they live and work.  I believe these types of policies foster trust and respect between people and law enforcement which will lower the violent crime rate. I also want Maryland to have the strictest gun safety laws in the nation. I am in favor of blanket bans on all semi-automatic weapons and requiring intrusive background checks to keep guns off our streets.","As a small business owner in Maryland, I understand what it takes to compete in a dynamic economy. Like most small business owners, I pay attention to immediate issues related to revenues, expenses, taxes, and infrastructure. Our state economy is at a crossroads, where economic development needs an injection of creativity and dynamism. The federal sector has long been a reliable employer, but as it's constantly put under duress by constrained federal budgets, it's clearly not enough to sustain our economy. I studied business at Carnegie Mellon University and teach there (in the DC office) as a Visiting Fellow. I believe that we need to unleash the vast human capital that our region both attracts from around the world and cultivates here in our schools.  For example, I believe we need to invest more aggressively in school construction, so that our children can learn in state of the art facilities. We also need to train our workforce more proactively in science, technology, and mathematics, so that workers can reinvent themselves through new skills acquisition. And we need to facilitate access to both capital and to technology incubator facilities to encourage new entrepreneurs to locate here in Maryland. Attracting companies like Amazon would help in this regard.  On the Chevy Chase Town Council, I made key votes on budget issues to ensure that our town is both balancing its books properly and supporting local economic development. I also support an $18 minimum wage and will crack down on pay discrimination.","Maryland is one of the most gerrymandered states in our country and, if elected, I'll advocate for the implementation of the recommendations of the independent citizen commission to transparently draw districts using objective and nonpartisan criteria. I am an enthusiastic supporter of my 9-year old daughter and wife who co-wrote The United Shapes of America, an anti-gerrymandering coloring book.","I would support increased civilian participation and voting on police hearing boards to make police departments accountable to the communities they serve. The House of Delegates recently passed HB 1016, which allows municipalities to appoint civilians to police hearing boards, but their power is limited and an officer can bypass the hearing altogether. As a Delegate, I would review the implementation of HB 1016 in order to measure whether it is an effective solution to police misconduct. I would also consider additional legislation to empower both civilian oversight and inspectors general who would oversee police internal affairs investigations and pass their findings on to the review board.  I also believe nondisclosure agreements are too often used to intimidate and silence victims of police misconduct and I would support restricting their use. We must remove special rules that lower the public trust and should instead increase transparency whenever possible, especially regarding an officer's disciplinary history. We cannot hold problematic officers accountable if key information is not made public. In this case, sunlight is the best disinfectant.","Drug addiction is a significant problem in our communities, particularly with the opioid crisis, as Maryland is one of the most impacted states by this crisis. We should therefore do all we can to prevent the spread of truly addictive narcotics, including prescription drug abuse.  I also recognize that our current drug laws have had an unacceptable disparate impact in terms of arrest rates for African Americans that far outstrip arrest rates for whites, despite similar usage rates. We need to take a closer look at this dynamic and review our law enforcement efforts to ensure that this disparity is rectified.  Ultimately, we have to treat addiction as a public health issue and not a criminal matter. That will require increased support for health outreach, behavioral therapy, and preventative education.","In addition to raising the state minimum wage, I would also call attention to the cost of living and explore policies that prevent rapid rent increases and curb abusive behavior on the part of landlords and developers.   Rent and property prices in many parts of Maryland are out of control and we must put in place sustainable policies that allow for affordable, rent-stabilized properties for middle and low-income families. According to the Montgomery County Rental Housing Study, released in June 2017, rental housing accounts for around 33% of all housing in the county, and 75% percent of renters earn less than the area's median income.   As Delegate, I would support policies such as rent stabilization and legislation that curbs abusive behavior and price gouging on the part of landlords and unscrupulous developers. I will also support sustainable development and infrastructure projects that allow our workforce to settle, live, and age with dignity here in my District, Montgomery County, and in communities around Maryland.","I believe our civic and political institutions are the bedrock of our society and we must do all we can to protect them from dangerous interference, both foreign and domestic.  I favor the public financing of state elections at all levels. Here in Montgomery County it has brought significant diversity and openness to the process. The result is that we have more competitive candidates who reflect the broad array of communities that make up the County. I believe the same should be done at the state level, as currently the individuals competing for state office are limited in both their economic and community diversity.   We need to create a state finance system that maximizes the value of small donors beyond just the dollar amount that they contribute. As Delegate, I would explore policies that make their contributions go further. This would drive a public financing program providing unparalleled government transparency, shifting power away from entrenched wealth, and encouraging new candidates to enter government.  I also believe that automatic voter registration, particularly through drivers licenses and other analogous mechanisms is a must. Additionally, I think we should rename ""Absentee Ballots"" to ""Mail-in Ballots"" Such reforms, in conjunction with strengthened amendments to the Public Information Act, would make our government more transparent and more accountable.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

In 2017 I worked with Delegate Bob Long in the legislative session as a legislative aid.   I have started my own political consulting firm.   I am currently a radio host and tv host to a news show.",I support funding our school systems and making sure that our citizens have access to their school boards and have more transparency with in our school systems.,Yes I believe that the state is adequately spending a balanced portion on both roads and transit. I live in the Baltimore County area and I have relied on the buss system as well as all forms of transit to get to and from work within the city and to neighboring counties. I have experienced the system before Governor Hogan was in office and after he took office. We did not need the red line but we need more buses and we need the bus routes to be at a constant time. Many of the buss routes are late or some times are not going because the buss drivers don't show up or there are not enough buses. we need to make sure that the buss routes are on time and constant. Peoples paycheck count on these buses to be on time and to make sure people get to work on time.,I support the full legalization of recreational marijuana as well as decriminalization.  Marijuana accounts for most of the criminal cases within the state of Maryland. This substance should never have been classified as a schedule 1 narcotic and should be regulated and taxed just like alcohol. The revenue alone from businesses as well as growers would add a revenue source that is sorely needed in today's society and could relive many of the taxes burdening the citizens of this state.,I believe that we need to commit efficient resources to clean up the Chesapeake Bay. This is a precious resource that we must not abandon nor should we neglect. I believed that the drilling off the shore of Maryland by the federal government was the wrong idea and could expose the Chesapeake Bay to disasters in the ecosystem and the water. Maryland is famous for its crabs and we need to provide every possible resource available to make sure this industry stays strong,"Having lost my job and being on medicare from the state. I know all to well how much an affordable healthcare system would mean to a family struggling to get by.  However, we can not afford to screw up and waste 400 million dollars on rolling out a state affordable healthcare system that does not work. I believe that we need to make sure the people have access to health care and make sure the people are able to seek medical help if they need it. But all to often these affordable programs implode due to the lack of people signing up and the premiums rising due to the fact that the young people just starting work have to pay higher premiums to offset the cost to the elderly.  This will drain the middle class and after a whole implode and become a mess. we need to make sure that we have a system that has competition and that we look to our  neighbors to the north and across the sea. England's system allows the opportunity for both a payer system and a government run system to make sure that all people are taken care of.","The state's role in addressing the Baltimore violent crime wave is to come up with bills that would allow for harsher punishments as well as body camera bills and funding needed to reinforce a police force. However the state can only do so much as far as bills. the Things that would actually make a difference, like community policing, cracking down on corruption and making sure that we keep these people off the streets comes down to the city of Baltimore and its mayor.","Maryland's business climate is on the rise thanks to Governor Hogan and his policies of getting Maryland back to work. However, we still have a ways to go to be number one. Many people are losing jobs do to automation jobs that would have provided family supporting pay and would allow people to put food on the table and a roof over their family's heads. Now many democrats are supporting a living wage or a 15 dollar an hour wage that would kill many small businesses and automate many of the left over minimum wage jobs. what we need to do is invest in our work force and train them for jobs such as plumbers and electricians and technical jobs so they can get hired for a job that would afford them a livable wage.","I fully support the creation of a non-partisan, independent body to draw legislative and congressional districts in Maryland. When we have the President of the Senate, the Speaker of the House , and former Governor O'Malley all saying that they intentionally drew these lines to get more democrats elected and to make sure that no republicans had a chance was subverting the voice of the people and broke a trust between the people of Maryland and their representatives. when listening to the Supreme court case of Maryland's redistricting case. Even the democratic Justices concurred that there was evidence of extreme bias in drawing of these lines. We need to bring the power and checks and balances back to the people and out of the hands of corrupt politicians that draw lines to favor them staying in power and for their party's gain.",I believe that the Officers Bill of Rights adequately balances the protections for police and the public.,The strategy I would adopt to address the opioid epidemic would be to make sure that the doctors prescribing many of these medications do not over prescribe and that we regulate the amount doctors can prescribe someone with pain.,"The state can address income inequality by investing in its workforce and providing training and opportunities with tech companies as well as labor companies, like plumbers and electricians to hire and train the work force for jobs that would provide them a living wage.","No the state's Public Information Act and open meeting laws do not adequately ensure Marylander's ability to exercise oversight of the government. We need to make sure that Marylander's are able to view, interact and trust their government. However that is difficult when the legislation wants to make bills such as HB 1723 that would take the school building programs out of the hands of the board of public works and put them in the hands of lobbyists, or when legislators vote against a bill that would audit and provide transparency about the funding of the Baltimore County school system.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

As a state we must begin to evaluate all of our corporate tax credits to ensure that we are only committing  money to programs that actually provide a benefit to Maryland, not put money in the pockets of large corporations. I am committed to looking at all discretionary spending to ensure that we fund our public educational system first.","Under this administration, spending is not balanced towards an approach that makes sense for Maryland. The state would have the resources it needs if we were properly evaluation projects and needs around the state. Baltimore is not adequately served by transit, and we cannot expect Baltimore to be able to experience the growth we want without a comprehensive public transportation system.","Yes, I do. For far too long, we have clogged our criminal justice system (Police work, courts, detention facilities, etc.) by criminalizing low level possession and use of marijuana. It is time we focus our attention on eliminating violent crime that has sprung out of the drug trade, and use the revenue to help our public educational systems.","We must continue to set strict guidelines and policies that ensure a healthy Bay. At the same time, we should be working with our federal partners to bring in as much federal money as possible to pay for the restoration, and maintenance of the Chesapeake Bay.",We have to look at adopting a true single-payer model in the State of Maryland.,"The state should help provide resources to the City of Baltimore to help address crime. This means providing the correct amount of funding for the public school system to end the school to prison pipeline. We should also provide funding to the Police Department to ensure officers are properly trained and equipped to do their jobs. We should also be providing smart crime policy that gives Police, Prosecutors, Judges, and Public Defenders the correct tools to deal with the various issues that individuals that enter our criminal justice system are actually dealing with.","I think we could always do better to make our state attractive to anyone who wants to open a business. We should be providing assistance for small businesses, and eliminating barriers for minority businesses to be successful.","I would like to see it happen for state legislative districts. For congressional districts, I think we need a national approach to ensure that representation is not impacted negatively in Maryland without our neighboring states, and states across the country also doing it. I think state leadership should be working with leadership from other states to bring ideas forward and lead the way to a real solution.","There have been instances in which the balance of protections of the LEOBR has been brought into question. I have my concerns, but I believe that the Police Officers should be at the table to discuss and negotiate any changes. I think we have to ensure transparency with our police force. As citizens we have given the police the authority over our constitutional rights if they believe we have committed a crime, their actions while in the line of duty should be held to the same standards.","Education about opioids and overdoses, policies that punish doctors, pharmacies, and other health care providers who assist in getting prescription opioids on the streets.","The state should have policies for state jobs that ensure there is no income inequality due to gender, race, ethnicity, etc. Before we ask private corporations to do something, the state should be wiling to do it with their own employees.",I am not well versed enough in these laws to know.

Like alcohol, marijuana should be regulated, the purchase of it should be regulated, and it should be criminal to drive while under its influence.",I would work with environmental groups to determine what additional steps can be taken to protect our amazing resource.,"Healthcare is and should be treated as a human right.  We need to ensure that every Marylander has access to affordable health care coverage. We must address our failing healthcare system.  The options in Maryland are thin, and costs continue to skyrocket.  At the same time, Carroll County has been hit hard by the opioid epidemic, and we have seen increases in overdoses year after year.  It is time that we stop ignoring mental health, and mental health treatment. While it has been proposed that employers could pay for universal healthcare through a wage tax, I am concerned that may be too burdensome on small business if all business is treated exactly the same.  Other proposals of a progressive tax, or sliding scale that balances deductibles and copays based on family income (with some paying nothing when appropriate) may be promising.  Ultimately, I would want to see a task force established to find the most appropriate method of funding a public option in the state of Maryland.","Leaders throughout Maryland  must work in collaboration with leaders in Baltimore. By taking a supportive rather than an instructive role, we are empowering those battling Baltimore's violence regularly to implement solutions.","I believe we must pay people a living wage.  In Carroll County, that is $15/hour.  It does vary from county to county and that should be taken into account.  Additionally, we must pay teachers and police a wage that allows them to live in the same communities they work in.  As the daughter of a small business owner, I am aware that Defendants often make the mistake of conflating 'big business' and 'small business' by lumping them together as 'business'.  We must work with small and local businesses to implement these regulations in a thoughtful and manageable way.  By taking such an approach, we can ensure that our business communities thrive and employees earn a living wage.",Absolutely.  Our state is incredibly gerrymandered and we must fix it so all residents have true representation.,"There are two things that are important to note here:  (1) communities are entitled to be protected and served by police and when they are not, when they face an occupation or harassment, those communities are entitled to justice; and (2) Many police departments are taking great care to be part of the community they serve, and their officers are also entitled to due process and protection in their extremely dangerous job.  As I am not a resident of Baltimore, I cannot speak for that community's relationship with their police, although it is clearly not a positive one.  In Carroll County, I have been very proud of our Sheriff's Department.","Universal healthcare would be an important first step.  Addiction is a mental health issue, and we must start treating it as such, rather than a criminal justice issue.  We must make more rehabilitation centers available to those seeking help. We need to focus on expanding treatment options in local communities, and seek alternatives free from opioid-driven treatment plans. Access to naloxone, immunity for those responding to overdoses, increasing the effectiveness of the PDMP to reduce overprescribing and identify doctors engaging in unethical prescribing practices are also critical.","I believe we must pay people a living wage.  In Carroll County, that is $15/hour.  It does vary from county to county and that should be taken into account.","Despite the efforts of many local jurisdictions to resist open government, we have made great strides in ensuring transparency in government. We still have improvements to make, and we need to protect individuals' information in the process.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

If fundamental unfairness that affects counties like mine is addressed,  I'll be more than happy to address their other recommendations. However, as a state, we are spending  $6.5 billion on education.  At some point, money alone can't be the answer.","Only 3-5% of the public regularly use mass transit, yet we spend about 50% of our transportation budget on it. Thankfully,  Governor Hogan has placed an emphasis on spending transportation money on projects that serve the other 95% of us, i.e., roads, bridges and the like. I support the Governor's reprioritization.","I don't support legalization until we get more data from States where it has been legalized, like Colorado.",I fully support the Governor's idea of requiring the owners of the Conowingo Dam to reduce sediment  (which is a major contributor to pollution in the Bay).,"The best thing the State can do is to stop mandating coverage for this and that, because those costs get passed along to the consumer.  Furthermore,  nationally, Congress needs to act to allow interstate competition by health insurance companies to drive down the costs of premiums.","The state spends millions of dollars on Baltimore City.  The legislature needs to spend less time coddling criminals,  and should enact stricter sanctions on repeat offenders, and drug dealers.  In 2018, we took some steps forward,  but there is more to do.","Under Governor Hogan's leadership, the business climate has improved considerably.  He has reduced regulations and has passed legislation to incentivize job creation.  There is more to do, and I will support additional efforts to revamp Maryland's tax policy to make us more competitive with surrounding states.",Absolutely.  I have cosponsored the Governor's bill to do just that. I firmly believe that the Supreme Court will ultimately take action to reverse O'Malley's gerrymandering.,"Yes, it does and no it should not.  One size does not fit all, and if the Baltimore Police Department has issues, those should be addressed through Baltimore-specific legislation.","We are spending a bunch of money on this epidemic.

I also am a Certified Professional in Learning and Performance (CPLP) by the Association of Talent Development,"I have been a public servant since 1992, when I began as a Child Protective Services worker for Harford County Department of Social Services. I was involved in public government oversight at the Citizens Review Board for Children, the Deputy Director of Campaign Finance for the Election Board, a Family Court Facilitator, a grant writer for the Department of Human Services, and a couples' therapist for Christ Lutheran Church.  I currently serve as the Education Program Manager for the State Retirement Agency.","Education is vital to our growth as a State. As such, we must always strive to improve our schools. The Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education provides many important recommendations that must be enacted. We must evaluate education's funding structure—the way it is currently structured is not working for our most vulnerable students. Our funding structure must be based on the cost to provide all students, regardless of where they live, a high-quality education that prepares them for a higher education and career.   I graduated from a Maryland Public School.  Teachers should be compensated for their sacrifice for our future.  I would oppose all legislation designed to weaken our public schools.","A strong public transportation is vital to protecting both our economy and environment. More people will use public transportation if it gets them where they need or want to go—the Red Line would have provided vital connections across the city for the people of Baltimore. As Delegate, I would advocate for state funds to build the Red Line to bolster Baltimore City's public transportation system. Our current budget is overly concerned with expanding roads to increase traffic and pollution.  Public transportation must also be safe and well maintained. The recent complete shutdown of the Baltimore Metro system was appalling and should have been prevented with proper oversight. It caused stress on workers, their employers, and customers. As Delegate, I would support strong regulatory oversight of public transportation safety and construction to ensure that our tax dollars are building projects made to last.","Marijuana has been proven to be much less addictive than the other Schedule 1 drugs. Legalizing marijuana in other states has resulted in a reduction in crime. While small amounts of marijuana are decriminalized in Maryland, people with larger amounts are still subject to criminal penalties. African-Americans do not use marijuana any more than members of other races, yet they are more often incarcerated for marijuana-related offenses. This contributes to the mass incarceration of African-Americans in the State of Maryland, causing deep pain in our communities. For these reasons, I support legalizing recreational marijuana for individuals age 21 and over.","Maryland must take strong steps to protect the Chesapeake Bay, a vital resource. Public awareness campaigns, like the don't be a litter bug campaign, must be part of all environmental protection legislation to ensure every generation understands how to protect our land, water and air. As State Delegate, I will sponsor and support legislation to ensure that environmental regulations stay in place at the state level to prevent large companies from polluting the Bay without regard for the devastating consequences such pollution has on Marylanders.","My daughter has Crohn's disease. Her treatments cost over $15,000 each. We even received a bill for over $43,000 for the exact same treatment she receives every 6 weeks. I am very thankful we have good insurance.  Unfortunately, that's not the case for everyone. No one should be a paycheck away from becoming bankrupt because they or someone in their family gets sick.  This empathy drives me to support single-payer healthcare to ensure every Marylander has access to the care they need. We must always incorporate community input when making changes to healthcare.  Healthcare is a right, not a privilege reserved for only the wealthy in society.","Addressing the root causes of violence is vital to ending its cyclic nature. The State government has an obligation to provide funding to programs like Safe Streets that are proven to help reduce violence.  The State must expand access to victim services.  All legislation should include funding for law enforcement training and community oversight. Furthermore, anti-crime legislation should include provisions that provide rehabilitation opportunities for offenders who have served their sentences to ensure they can reintegrate into society.","Maryland's current business climate is cautiously optimistic. However, we need qualified workers to fill positions.  In recent years, Maryland has spent considerable time, energy, and money courting larger corporations at the expense of many of our small family owned and minority businesses. Maryland needs to facilitate long lasting relationships between our local businesses and our higher education institutions to reduce education costs, keep local businesses current with innovations and trends, and meet the need for qualified employees.","Districts in Maryland are not drawn fairly. Gerrymandering, regardless of which party does it, is undemocratic. Voters should choose their representatives—not the other way around. Maryland needs an independent multi-partisan commission that uses mathematical equations to determine districts.","As a former child protective services worker and a program manager for the Law Enforcement Officers Pension System, I understand the risks and sacrifices our State and local law enforcement officers make to protect Marylanders. That said, every profession has a few poor performing misguided workers who are clearly in the wrong profession and reflect poorly on the rest of the team. In law enforcement, a minority of misguided individuals have caused horrific instances of police brutality that reflect poorly on the entire force when they are protected rather than terminated.   An unjust society is created when any citizen is given more rights than other citizens. All workers, regardless of profession, should be protected while performing their duties—but these protections should not permit willful negligence or immunity from responsibility. Police officers deserve the same due process rights as every day civilians and not special treatment. This will allow corrupt officers to be brought to justice and dedicated officers to continue protecting Marylanders.","The opioid epidemic is a mental health and substance abuse issue.    Tough on drug campaigns don't work. People don't stop using or selling drugs because they are afraid of going to jail. If it did, our drug epidemic would have been solved when these campaigns were initiated 30 years ago, 20 years ago, 10 years ago and 4 years ago.  People addicted to drugs and their families need services, not punishment. Addiction is already difficult enough. As a community, we need treatment, not punishment.   Our judicial system is not equipped to rehabilitate people addicted to drugs.  We need more treatment centers, not bigger prisons.  Our mental health and substance abuse communities must be given the resources to lead us to recovery. Properly funding healthcare to include mental health and substance abuse treatment helps protect our communities.","Raising the minimum wage is the first step in improving the economic situations for many hard-working Marylanders. No one who works forty hours a week should live in poverty. Fifteen dollars an hour is a sensible minimum wage that would help lift people out of poverty. I would support implementing this minimum wage gradually over the next three fiscal years, with full implementation by fiscal year 2022.   Income inequality solutions must also address access to clean water, healthy food and quality education.","Our State's Public Information Act and open meetings laws are a start; combined with citizen oversight, these laws provide transparency, cut waste, and improve government programs.  As State Delegate, I would sponsor and support more citizen review programs to audit and improve government functioning.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

I am the product of public education and my son is a future Baltimore public school student.  Better funded and performing schools are central to combating Baltimore's population decline. Adequate school funding is needed to ensure Baltimore City youth are ready for kindergarten and our high school graduates can successfully obtain a post-secondary credential.  Due to historic and enduring social/economic inequities, nearly 90 percent of Baltimore students live in poverty.  This is why I am fully committed to enhancing school funding to meet the challenges of districts with high rates of poverty.  In order to achieve necessary funding reforms, I support increased taxes on tobacco products, using gaming revenue to supplement not supplant school funding, and increasing the inheritance tax for millionaires.",The cancellation of the Red Line was a generational miss for Baltimore.  Nearly 1/3 of Baltimore households do not have regular access to a vehicle and neighborhoods with the highest rates of unemployment often have some of the longest commute times to job centers around the perimeter of the City.  Improved investments in light rail and metro will increase the competitiveness of the Baltimore region and the state overall. We must use all resources available to improve our transit system. We must also aggressively pursue federal transportation support whenever possible.,"While I'm still studying the impact of full legalization in other states, I am not opposed to full legalization.  For too long, disproportionate amounts of Baltimore residents have faced criminal prosecution for marijuana possession. These marijuana-related criminal records have impeded the ability for residents to obtain jobs or receive student aid in pursuit of higher education. Full legalization should be explored to assess the impact on state revenue to support priorities around education, transportation, and workforce/small business development.","I've spent my entire life in the Chesapeake Bay watershed and know that this important natural resource is a vital part of Maryland's natural heritage and economy. With uncertain commitments from the U.S. Environmental Protection Administration (EPA), it is critical for Maryland to aggressively clean up local waterways that feed into the Bay. The health of the Bay is continuously compromised by nitrogen, phosphorus and sediment pollution.  That is why I support Maryland closing any bay protection/restoration funding gap that results from federal cuts.",I support researching the feasibility of implementing single-payer health care on the state level. Passing single payer would require a coordinated education campaign with advocacy allies. It would also be critical to learn lessons from other recent failed efforts to adopt a single payer system. California is one important example to unpack and analyze. I'm intrigued by the funding strategy outlined by California Representative Pete Stark entitled AmeriCare that would cover all children from birth and allow employers to buy into the plan to keep costs down. Employers would cover 80 percent of the premiums and workers 20 percent. The system would eventually yield a situation where most people would be covered by Medicare or Americare.,"While publicly viewed as a municipal law enforcement agency, the Baltimore Police Department (BPD) is a state agency. As the BPD navigates addressing systemic abuses uncovered in the U.S. Department of Justice report and the recent criminal prosecution of the Gun Trace Taskforce, the limits of municipal oversight are significant. That's why Maryland should be supportive of transferring municipal control over to the City of Baltimore so that City Council and our Mayor are more fully empowered to shape BPD policy.   One of the most challenging populations to support in combating violent crime are Opportunity Youth. Disconnected or Opportunity Youth (defined as young people ages 16-24 who are not enrolled in school or employed) are more likely to live in poverty, have limited social bonds and are vulnerable to the temptations of crime. Creating an environment where Opportunity Youth can reconnect is essential to improving community safety and well-being.  I support:  -Increasing state funding for localities to scale evidence-based violence interruption programs like ""Safe Streets"" -Establishing a state fund for programs that target employment and education pathways for Opportunity Youth -Establishing tax incentives and state procurement preference for companies that hire and support the development of Opportunity Youth","We have a moderately welcoming business environment. Strengths include our location along the Eastern seaboard, higher education network, and port. However, our rising cost of living, limited transportation network (particularly in the Baltimore region), and tax rate decrease the perception of business ""friendliness.""  While the courting of mega businesses like Amazon attracts a ton of media coverage, smaller businesses drive our state's economy and are key to neighborhood revival. That's why it's important to think about how we can better support community-based businesses access capital. Additionally, 1 out of 5 residents of the Greater Baltimore region have criminal records that hamper their employment mobility.  It's critical for workers with a criminal record to be able to earn a living wage in order to have more stable and sustainable consumer markets that in turn support small/large businesses.",Yes.,No. There should be more opportunities for civilian oversight and transparency in police misconduct files.,"I support making overdose-reversal drugs more accessible in public places, expanding training on proper use, enhancing addiction treatment for inmates, and expanding alternatives to incarceration for low-level drug offenses.",Pass a state minimum wage of at least $15 per hour.,Improved enforcement of these laws are critical to enhancing public trust.,"Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

Maryland has long claimed to be #1 in Education while ignoring the growing achievement gaps and in-equities in educational opportunity within and among districts and populations of students. The recommendations presented by the Kirwan Commission provide a comprehensive framework with strategies that will move Maryland forward toward college and career readiness, but only if the implementation maintains a strong emphasis on equity.   Investing in early childhood education, strengthening the quality of teachers and school leaders, providing coordinated wrap around services through community schools, and expanding CTE pathways are practical, high impact strategies that will take a major increase in dollars but will reflect the states priority and meet our constitutional requirements. The lock box on the casino dollars was first step in paying for Kirwan. Some of the initiatives may need to phased in while revenue strategies are developed. Moving dollars away from institutional incarceration in favor of more successful and affordable community based rehabilitation strategies can also increase our investment in education while continuing to balance the budget responsibly.","No due to the continued focused on automobiles and roads as evidence by planned expansion of major interstates versus the cancellation of the Red Line.  Yes, the state does have the resources that meet its transportation needs.  For example, the expansion plans of I-295 and I-270.  The Baltimore region is not adequately served by transit.","My personal belief is no I do not support the legalization of recreational marijuana.  However, recognizing the economic impact upon the state of Maryland and the work that has been done on behalf of Baltimore City as well as a large consensus of constituents who in fact do support the recreational use of marijuana for that reason I would support it.",Additional protection on secondary waterways and an increase focus on sewage runoff.,"Affordable health care should be a right and not an after-thought.  The steps Maryland should take are to improve, support and protect the Affordable Care Act.","A good first step was the passing of the non-violent felony expungement bill which was a part of the overall crime bill legislation.  In addition, increasing focus on the underlying social factors that drive crime and merge that with an increase focus on re-entry for returning citizens.","I believe Maryland is Open for Business.  From the focus on increasing the overall small business participation from 10% to 15% and the increase compliance of MBE & VSBE participation.  Ensure that businesses hire local, and that existing businesses have the resources they need to expand.  Thriving small, minority, veteran and women-owned businesses will create community wealth and increase jobs and opportunities throughout the state.",Yes I do support the creation of a non-partisan independent body.,No it does not balance the protection for police and the public.  Yes it should be changed.  It should be changed by shifting the focus back to the rights of the citizens.  The police are treated more like citizens than the public is.,"State and Federal legislation needs to be more comprehensive in addressing prescription, distribution, and abuse.",The start would be to pass legislation on $15 per hour minimum wage as well as tax credits for low-income wage earners.,"The laws are adequate; however, adherence to the laws can be an issue.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

Sydnor III,Sydnor,3/18/1974,Catonsville,Democratic,Baltimore County,http://www.charlessydnor3d.org,Citizens@CharlesSydnor3d,CharlesSydnor3d,http://surveygizmoresponseuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/fileuploads/296249/4297291/52-1f71f28c0c42e3fcb700b91a3c33f0da_DSC_3589.jpg,"Baltimore Polytechnic Institute, A Course diploma Johns Hopkins University, BA University of MD Baltimore County, MPS University of MD School of Law, JD",Attorney,"Yes, I support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education.  To fund the reforms noted by the Commission, I supported HB 1697 during the 2018 session to  achieve the promise made years ago when casino gambling was first allowed in Maryland-- to supplement funding for our public schools.  If approved by the voters at the next general election, HB 1697 would require the Governor to provide supplemental State funding dedicated to public education through gambling revenues beginning in fiscal 2020.","No, the Baltimore region is not adequately served by transit. Maryland could spend more on its public transportation system.  Earlier this year, the Baltimore Subway system was unexpectedly shut down for emergency inspection and repairs. This hindered many passengers, including my constituents', ability to get to work.  Many riders were forced to find other means to reach their  workplace.  If proper investments were made to our transit system, we would not have found ourselves in the situation we did.    According to the Opportunity Collaborative, ""transportation barriers present additional challenges for residents who depend on public transportation to get to work. A quarter (25%) of job seekers indicate that they can't get to jobs accessing public transportation. According to workforce development directors, most transportation problems are linked to the distance between where most low-skilled or low-income workers live (e.g. in Baltimore City) and where most new jobs are being created (outside the city). For parents, the transit travel times can be very long if they must first travel to child care and then again access transit to go to work.""  See https://www.baltometro.org/phocadownload/Publications/OpportunityCollaborative/170508_Barriers_to_Employment_Opportunity_in_the_Baltimore_Region-June_2014.pdf So we need to be sure the right investments are made in order to serve this region by a system which serves all of our residents.  I certainly would enjoy being able to ride a connected subway system around the Baltimore Metropolitan area as I do in Washington, DC and its suburbs.","Not at this time.  While I have supported the decriminalization and medical use of marijuana,  I am still waiting to see how legalization of recreational marijuana plays out in the states that have decided to take this step.","There are likely multiple things we can all do and many things may not be new. Maryland must continue on its path to ensure that the TMDLS  protects this resource.  I think we also need to work with our federal elected officials to make sure they have what they need to ensure this administration does its job.  Marylanders also need to understand that Chesapeake Bay restoration actually starts out in our community streams which feed into the Bay.  In my district, we have Patapsco State Park and the streams in my community feed into the Bay.  Annually communities get out and clean their communities to stop waste upstream from affecting the bay downstream.","We took an important step this past session when we voted to create the Maryland Health Insurance Coverage Protection Commission.  The Commission is required to provide recommendations for individual and group health insurance market stability in its report by December 31, 2019.   I am hoping that within that report, we will have an answer on how we can ensure the broadest possible access to affordable health care.","While there is no silver bullet to this complex issue, the State should ensure that Baltimore has the resources it needs to address the problems.  I believe the establishment of the Maryland Violence Intervention and Prevention Program Fund and a related advisory council within the Governor's Office of Crime Control and Prevention is something that should be beneficial to helping Baltimore address violent crime.  I also think removing barriers which ultimately hinder people, who are working to be self-sufficient, must be reexamined.  By way of example, denying applications for occupational licenses or certificates based solely on the applicant's criminal history is unjustifiable if  that individual demonstrated that they are a constructive and contributing member of their community.","I think it really depends on the community.  In some areas of the state, business seems to be booming.  In other parts of this state, businesses are hurting.  We need to ensure that in those communities where, businesses do not want to open shop, we provide the communities with skills to be entrepreneurs and create their own jobs.  Jobs in industries like transportation, information technology, healthcare, and manufacturing offer some of the best opportunities for family-supporting careers.  I introduced House bill 1606 this past session based upon legislation in Virginia which supported those industries most in need.  The bill would have established a Workforce Shortage Vocational Certificate Grant Program for students who pledge to work in fields of critical shortage in the State on receipt of a vocational certificate. We also should ensure that Maryland once again is rated   number-one for public schools and we should continue to support our colleges and universities.","I do support the creation of a non-partisan, independent body to draw legislative and congressional district maps after each census.   The concern for me is how the non-partisan, independent body would be formed and how reflective of the state's diversity it will be.  While I support the work of the Maryland Redistricting Reform Commission, I  did not agree with the recommendation that it be composed of a nine member panel with 3 Democrats, 3 Republicans and 3 nonaffiliated members. The makeup of this commission is likely where support will either be won or lost.","Over the past few years, we have observed some officers acting with impunity. This issue with Baltimore City Police Department's the gun task force has really brought to light complaints about corruption that were often buried. This is evidence that something is not working.  So yes, something more needs to be done; whether it is the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights or something else, that can be addressed legislatively we need to find the answer and fix it.  We need to determine whether the LEOBR hinders transparency with regard to whether officers are held accountable when they cross certain lines.  If not, we need to understand where things went so wrong that the Baltimore City Police department would miss such criminality over such a long period of time.   The public has to feel comfortable with how police departments deal with records pertaining to use of force complaints and actions by law enforcement officers.","Where the state is using its resources to address this as the public health problem that it is, I believe the state is doing a good job.  I believe we need to ensure more funds are there to help those addicted as well as to address the underlying problem that drive people to drug use.  Where I think we have gone wrong is criminalizing addiction. I think the stabilization center being financed in Baltimore is a great step.  In fact, during my first session Senator Shirley Nathan Pulliam and I championed legislation to examine how law enforcement was dealing with people with substance abuse and mental health issues.  The bill created a pilot program for Baltimore City and County to establish behavioral health units with officers who were trained to deal with the general public exhibiting  mental health issues or even substance use disorders.  We brought in an expert from Texas to describe how they used  these stabilization centers so that these populations were not longer being sent to jail, but to a place where they could obtain wrap around services.",Ensure that people have great schools to attend so that they can obtain good paying jobs to own a home and support their family.  The barriers to home ownership must be addressed to alleviate income inequality.   I also believe that we have to ensure that we support legislation like Delegate Shelly Hettleman's 2018 $15 minimum wage bills.  If her bill was not the answer than we have to continue working towards something that we can move forward and pass.,"While Maryland's Public Information Act and open meetings laws do ensure Marylanders' ability to exercise oversight of the government, there is room to consider improvement to the law.  By way of example, we need to reexamine how we deal with records pertaining to use of force complaints and actions by law enforcement officers.  This issue with Baltimore City Police Department's the gun task force has really brought to light complaints about corruption that were often buried. What we learned was that there was corruption, but because of the law governing personal records, we were never able to put forth evidence of what was really happening.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

Baltimore City Public Schools are failing our kids and lack educational and fiscal accountability. I cosponsored Gov. Hogan's bill for an Inspector General to bring accountability and investigate fraud, abuse and waste in all the schools across our state. We need more efficient use of tax dollars to get more resources to the classroom.  It did not pass but will come back next year.  To ensure the safety of all our students, teachers, and school personnel, I voted for the School Safety bill and sponsored a bill to put a School Resource Officer in every school.   Expanding school choice, especially for kids in chronically failing schools, is a great idea.  I supported Governor Hogan's BOOST scholarship program for income eligible K-12 students to be used in any eligible nonpublic school.  This bipartisan measure has been a big success. This year, in a partisan reaction to Governor Hogan and Comptroller Franchot, the liberals in Annapolis transferred the accountability for public schools from Hogan and Franchot to an unelected and unaccountable bureaucratic commission.  I voted against this and I am concerned about a big expansion of funds into a system without an Inspector General or elected officials' oversight.  The Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education did not support this radical move.  They did have some other good ideas.","I am proud to partner with Governor Hogan as we have done a good job of repairing crumbling roads and bridges and addressing the congestion in Maryland.  The innovative program to sync traffic lights using technology should help get traffic moving more efficiently.  Also, widening of the Baltimore beltway by adding a lane through re-striping will have an immediate effect on traffic.   Maryland transportation spending is too heavily weighted on mass transit.  With 92% of the population using cars and only 8% mass transit, the funding should be more aligned to how people get around.   Local highway and road funds should be restored. When motorists fill up their vehicles, they expect the gas taxes they pay to be used to fix all the roads they drive on.  The state needs to fully fund local and county transportation funds.",No,"The Chesapeake Bay is the centerpiece of Maryland and our national treasure.  Continuing to clean up the Bay for our kids and grandkids is the priority we can most directly impact.  Ensuring the pollution behind the Conowingo Dam is cleaned up and that neighboring states enforce clean water and environmental standards is a challenge we must meet.  This needs to be a local, state and regional partnership.","The predicted demise of the Affordable Care Act has caused skyrocketing health insurance rates and the destabilization of the individual market.  The Affordable Care Act has become unaffordable as we were facing another huge insurance premium increase of 50% this fall.  Without action from Washington D.C., states are forced into repairing the ACA.  As a member of the Health and Government Operations Committee, I worked with Governor Hogan, and Maryland Insurance Commissioner Al Redmer to create a bipartisan one-year fix for next year.  A reinsurance program, also being considered at the national level and passed in other states, will stabilize the individual insurance market and may even bring reduced premiums.   I also introduced a bill to offer lower premium plans in the individual market.  This value plan, the Copper Plan, offered a higher deductible and covered the ten essential benefits mandated in the ACA.  The Copper Plan reduced monthly premium costs significantly.  There are too many people who would like to have health insurance but cannot afford it.  I hope to get it passed next year. We must work to reduce the overall cost of health care and drugs with innovation and incentives for healthy lifestyles.  Finding ways to help people to manage chronic diseases like diabetes will help reduce health care costs for patients and everyone.","The violent crime and murder rate in Baltimore City has garnered national attention.  I joined Governor Hogan and others in calling for legislative action this session.  I voted for three good crime bills that passed.  They will help address violent crime not just in Baltimore City, but across our state.   We mandated tougher penalties on repeat violent offenders who are terrorizing our communities.  Criminals convicted of drug trafficking while using an illegal gun will be subjected to a mandatory minimum 5 year sentence on top of their other sentences.  Violent offenders will face at least ten years in jail.  We made it easier to prosecute high-volume drug dealers and increased penalties for dealers selling deadly fentanyl.   There were also provisions in the crime bills that increase penalties on those convicted of witness intimidation and we toughened sentences on sexual abuse of a child.  This is a good start to turning around the violent crime in Baltimore.","I am proud of my lifetime A+ rating with the top business association, Maryland Business for Responsive Government (MBRG).  They rate legislators votes on taxes and business issues. Under Governor Hogan's leadership and with my full support of good legislation, Maryland's economy is turning around.   I voted for the single-sales factor bill this year that will favor Maryland based businesses and allow them to grow and support more Maryland jobs.  This will improve Maryland's business climate as it is phased in.   Businesses in Maryland are having some trouble finding workers with the skills necessary to fill specific job requirements.  We have been delivering education for the same way for the last 100 years.  It's time to get creative and innovated and makes sure high school graduates have the educational and work places skills needed for jobs in the 21st century.","I have been a cosponsor of Governor Hogan's redistricting reform bills.  We need to implement a non-partisan panel to draw our state and federal districts.  Maryland has some of the most gerrymandered districts in the nation.  The Supreme Court is reviewing Maryland's congressional districts now.   Governor Hogan's redistricting bill was voted down again this year on a party-line vote.  Hopefully, Governor Hogan will get a chance to lead redistricting in 2021 after the 2020 census is complete and all 50 states undertake this decennial charge.  The current process deprives Marylanders of real choices and a fair political debate.  Voters should choose their representatives instead of politicians choosing their voters.","Law enforcement is essential to the maintenance of our freedom and liberty.  I support law enforcement.  The men and women who risk their lives daily to protect us deserve our respect as well as the families of officers who worry if their loved ones will return home.   There will always be bad actors in every sector of our society, including law enforcement.  The corruption in the Baltimore City Police Department darkened the reputation of law enforcement at every level.  Ensuring that corruption is routed out and removed is important for maintaining public trust in law enforcement.   The LEOBR is adequate now and, as with all things, it should be monitored.","As a member of the Health and Government Operations Committee, I am proud to be a partner with Governor Hogan in addressing Maryland's opioid crisis.  Governor Hogan was the first governor in the nation to declare a State of Emergency to ensure that all levels of state government were deployed to fight this crisis.  Over the last four years, we have committed more than $500 million towards fighting this epidemic.  Expanding access to overdose reversing drugs like narcan, expanding access to rehab and recovery programs, and educating  our children about the extreme dangers of opioids have saved lives.   Creating a pill mill tip line, tracking overdoses to fight fentanyl laced heroin, and heightening awareness to overprescribing and overusing opioids for medical care are a few things we accomplished this year.  There is more to do and we must use all the tools in our toolbox.","Every citizen deserves an equal opportunity to succeed and the tools to achieve their dreams.  Our American Dream should be attainable for all American citizens. Education is a key component of earning power and ability.  Every child deserves a world-class education in a safe neighborhood, regardless of their zip code.  Expanding job opportunities including the trades and technology is essential in high schools across our state.  Every one of our public high schools should have access to trades and technical training.  Not every student wants to go to college and a career in the trades or the military are a great options that are often not offered to our kids.  Remedial classes are needed for more of our college bound students every year.  Our public K-12 schools must do a better job of preparing students for higher education.   Baltimore City Public Schools are failing too many of our kids and we need accountability to ensure that kids are not left behind.  Of Baltimore City's 39 High Schools, 13 had zero students proficient in math in 2017.  If none of the students in these high schools are proficient in math, it will be almost impossible for them to get ahead.  This cannot be ignored.","It is appalling that the Maryland House and Senate floor proceedings are not available by video for the public.  We are one of only seven states without public video access to legislative actions in the house and senate chambers.   For the last three years, I have introduced a bill to require public video access.  Governor Hogan has also introduced his own bill and provided funding in the budget.   The liberal leadership in Annapolis continues to block this common sense transparency measure and they have refused to pass a bill to make the Maryland legislature fully transparent to the public.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

I attended elementary and middle school in Howard County, and I am a proud graduate of Oakland Mills High School, Class of 1987.","I am honored to have represented District 3 on the Howard County Council since 2006.

I also served on the Board of Directors of the Maryland Economic Development Corporation, and as a member of the Governor's Task Force for Student Physical Fitness.  Previously, I served as Chair of the Kings Contrivance Village Board and worked as an attorney for 6 years at The Women's Law Center of Maryland.  After law school, I was a Judicial Law Clerk for judges on both the Court of Appeals of Maryland and the Circuit Court for Howard County.","Yes. I'm encouraged by the emphasis on early childhood learning and the impact of poverty. I support expanding early childhood education program so that all four-year-olds have access to a full-day program and that three-year-olds from low-income families can as well.  Assessing school readiness, creating an early warning system for at-risk students, and expanding after-school and summer programs for youth are also extremely important. We need to ensure students are on track for college and career readiness standard by, among other things, defining college and career pathways for junior and seniors including requiring the availability of technical training leading to ""an industry certified credential."" This last recommendation should open the door to increased partnership with union apprenticeship programs. The other big piece of these recommendations is attracting and recruiting high quality teachers which is essential to accomplishing any of these student related goals. To do this, we must increase teacher pay, honor contracts, and maintain high quality benefits. The Commission will include funding recommendations in its final report. I hope these will include resources to combat the negative impact of poverty on school communities. The Fix the Fund Act, which passed this session and will go to the voters in November, is a major step in the right direction to addressing the existing $2.9 billion annual funding shortage, and would create an additional dedicated source of funding going forward. If adopted, approximately $500 million will be redirected toward education which should help in funding many of our education priorities.","No. Maryland's transportation spending is too focused on roads.  We must invest more in public transportation and other alternative transportation modes. While additional resources would be helpful, appropriately prioritizing transit would go a long way.  While rail links, including the Red Line, are important, Maryland needs to immediately improve its existing bus systems, both to provide local and regional transportation options to individuals without cars (including those with disabilities and seniors) and to provide reasonable commuting options to job centers in Baltimore and Washington, DC.","I support the legalization, and regulation, of recreational marijuana.  Despite the fact that recreational use of marijuana remains illegal, there is no doubt that it is still regularly consumed in Maryland. Recent legalization of medical marijuana and decriminalization of possession of smaller amounts of marijuana (less than 10 grams) are steps in the right direction.  However, Maryland should expand this to legalizing recreational use of marijuana for a number of reasons. Currently, marijuana is unregulated, leading to more dangerous products. Legalization would allow for government regulation which would make marijuana usage safer.  Moreover, the fact that marijuana is illegal leads to arrests and incarceration that disproportionately impacts low income communities and communities of color. Legalizing marijuana would end costly police enforcement and incarceration and allow police resources to be redirected to more important issues.  States that have legalized marijuana have seen better than expected impact on their economies. For example, in Colorado, legalized marijuana has created more than 18,000 jobs and added over $2 million annually to its economy. Legalization of marijuana would be good for the Maryland economy through job creation and increased tax revenues. Finally, with more than 60% of Marylanders supporting the legalization of marijuana, it's the right time to change the law, make usage safer, and improve our economy at the same time.","As the largest estuary in the United States, the Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure and a vital part of Maryland's identity and economy.  The State of Maryland must continue to press our partners in the federal government, other states in the Chesapeake watershed, the private sector, and NGOs to prioritize funding for initiatives and programs that support the Bay's restoration.  We can best do this by demonstrating Maryland's continued strong commitment to protecting the Bay's habitat and water quality. This includes supporting cleanup efforts, funding initiatives like oyster restoration, and better managing the quality of stormwater runoff.  Continuing to reduce agricultural pollution must also be part of our multi pronged solution. I remain committed to supporting a stormwater fee program, as it can provide a dedicated revenue source for maintaining, operating, and improving septic and stormwater systems in Maryland.  We must continue to put pressure on the larger jurisdictions to meet required percentages of impervious treatment through their MS4 permit.  A return to loosely held unenforceable guidelines will cause us to regress in our Bay cleanup efforts and undermine our ability to enlist stronger action by our partners throughout the watershed.  Finally, given that climate change is already having an impact on the health of the Bay, Maryland must also continue to work toward deeper cuts in greenhouse gas emissions by boosting investments in clean energy and advancing low-carbon, climate-resilient development.","I believe healthcare is a human right, and therefore, I support universal health care. In addition, making sure all Marylanders have high quality health care is critical to our economy. Ultimately, I believe that as a nation we must implement Medicare for all, and join the rest of the developed world with universal, government provided healthcare. In addition, holistic health care must be a focus moving forward. This should include mental and dental parity, requiring coverage equal to other health care coverage instead of treating these critical forms of care as luxuries. And finally, we must work to reduce to cost of prescription drugs by preventing price gouging by drug companies. Given the unraveling of the ACA on the federal level,  Maryland has to do more. Creating and funding a reinsurance pool by taxing all health insurers is a great first step . In the short term, this fund will cover the costs of insuring high risk Marylanders, while reducing premiums for everyone else. However, this is not enough.  Maryland needs to study other possible reforms to make sure that all Marylanders have healthcare.","The entire state must invest in Baltimore.  Baltimore is Maryland's largest city and a major employment hub.  Baltimore draws in tourism and other revenue, and serves as a corporate hub for national companies.  When companies leave Baltimore and people choose not  to visit, the entire surrounding area suffers.  Most violence in Baltimore is due to the drug trade and a lack of opportunities for youth and young adults.  A holistic approach which invests in creating job opportunities for low income youth and young adults, as well as safe activities and activities for youth, would decrease the number of young people involved in violent crime.  Further, we need to divert individuals from incarceration and work to rehabilitate offenders rather than allow those individuals to move into more serious and dangerous criminal activity.","Maryland can support better jobs and encourage businesses to move to and expand in Maryland by working to provide healthcare for all, allowing for a more productive workforce.  Maryland can also strengthen laws supporting unionization in order to help Marylanders ensure that work pays.","Yes. After the last census, I was on the County Council when we went through the process for councilmanic districts. The process of drawing district maps is incredibly complex, and needs expert review, as well as true. Creating a truly non-partisan, independent body is an important piece of improving this process.  In addition, the legislature needs to create transparent  parameters for drawing districts that are codified, rather than leaving the process wholly open.","	The Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights needs to be improved to protect the public and to protect law enforcement.  Our LEOBR is one of the oldest in the Country.  The vast majority of law enforcement officers are amazing professionals. They want to have great relationships with communities, and they want to do the right thing.  Due process is important. The public and officers need to be protected from the negative behavior of a few bad apples, and the public too needs to be supported to make sure that all government officials and employees are held accountable.","Drug addiction, not just opioid addiction, is a disease and should be treated as such. The media and political attention surrounding the opioid crisis  has lead to a shift toward viewing addiction more as a disease and less as criminal or deviant behavior. Drug addiction is an epidemic, impacting a staggering number of people and families and causing countless deaths. Addressing this crisis is complicated and will require an all hands on deck approach including better addiction prevention, treatment, and recovery services.  In addition, we also need better pain management, mental health support, and increased availability of overdose reversing drugs.","There is no question that the state needs to do more to proactively address income inequality. Wages have not kept pace with housing prices for decades. Creating and expanding meaningful housing programs in addition to addressing the root cause of income inequality will provide additional support to families and individuals. Maryland must needs to make sure that work pays and that workers can support their families.  Maryland should ensure a $15 minimum wage for all workers, and expand living wage requirements, including requiring government contractors include living wages, good benefits, and insurance for their workers  Maryland needs to require paid sick leave and paid family leave to ensure that no worker has to choose between their job and their family.  Maryland must support collective bargaining and ensure that workers have the right to unionize.  And, Maryland must ensure universal healthcare for all Marylanders so that health care costs never again bankrupt another Maryland family.","No. All decision making by public bodies should take place in public.  Information reviewed by those bodies should be timely posted online, in a searchable format. However, making information available to the public is useless unless there is someone to see it, analyze it, and question it. Having an independent, free press is vitally important. I'm deeply concerned about recent attacks on free press. Labeling legitimate news that sources information and ask real questions of those in and out of office as ""fake news"" undermines our ability to exercise oversight over government. Also dangerous is shifting our intake of news exclusively to social media. There is a difference between opinion and/or false information on one side and verifiable factual information on the other side. If we don't support legitimate news sources, we get what we pay for. If we don't believe facts that we read about in those sources, it does us no good. And if we don't care and act on what we learn, we are not doing our part in exercising oversight over our government. While the discussion on the national stage is distressing, Maryland is moving in the right direction -  Passing laws to make information more accessible through PIA and open meetings laws (for example, I co-sponsored legislation locally that among other things required data posted by Howard County to be in searchable format); learning as a society to distinguish between legitimate news sources and trolls on Facebook; and greatly increased activism since the 2016 elections.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

I served as a member of Senator Cardin's legislative staff. There, I covered universal health care reform – finding ways to end healthcare disparities, improving the Children's Health Insurance Program, and related health and wellness issues.   After working in the U.S. Senate, I joined local 1199 Service Employees International Union (SEIU) where I continued efforts toward affordable health care by facilitating the implementation of a $4.6 million Green Grant issued by the U.S. Department of Labor. The grant provided workforce training to over 500 workers, reduced the carbon footprint of 9 health care institutions throughout Maryland, and promoted cost savings by increasing recycling on patient floors, using rechargeable batteries, and initiating composting programs.  I continue to advocate for working families, workforce development, and patient centered healthcare in my current role at Johns Hopkins Home Care Group. I serve as a hospital administrator working with Hopkins physicians to integrate an expansive health care software system that will enhance care for seniors and children across Maryland.","Yes, I support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education.  Yes, I am committed to funding associated reforms.  I would champion efforts to bring student performance up to meet global competition.  I would advocate for increased spending in economically disadvantaged communities. According to the commission, Maryland spends 5% more on wealthy districts than those that are underserved.  Students who come from uniquely impoverished circumstances deserve better.  Increased public education funding would promote smaller class sizes.  Classroom size in Baltimore is non-negotiable.  However, other states like Massachusetts, New Jersey, and California have negotiable class size.  We should have the right to have flexible class sizes.  This would result having the proper population in a classroom so students can receive the attention they deserve.","Maryland's transportation spending is not appropriately balanced.  Maryland needs to invest more funds for transit to benefit a greater number of citizens. The Red Line would have been a tremendous boost to Baltimore's transit infrastructure, but the General Assembly and the governor failed to secure a deal.  Lower income residents were hurt the most by the loss of the Red Line.  Many believe the Baltimore Link was a poor compromise and their voices were drowned out during the decision making process.  As Delegate, I would make sure my constituents were not only informed when major decisions were being adjudicated, but I would invite them to public hearings to ensure their testimonies are and recorded.  Finally, I believe it valuable to review all innovative transit plans to help Maryland residents remain competitive in the regional job market.  Transit ideas such as the Loop underground rail plan, designed by the Boring Company should be reviewed.  The privately funded public-private transit model could ease traffic congestion and limit development along the Baltimore-Washington corridor.","Yes, I do support the legalization of recreational marijuana.  Maryland will save millions from not incarcerating users for possession of small amounts of marijuana and have the ability to regulate its responsible use.",The federal government remains an important partner in Chesapeake Bay restoration.  Several agencies have commitments to maintain the progress made in restoring the Bay.  Additional funds for restoration and clean up can come from tourism dollars and taxes on plastics.  Coordination of restoration activities with the states that comprise the Chesapeake Watershed will be critically important during the rollback of regulations and support from the current presidential administration.,"I have long supported a single payer system.  Single payer will help lower costs and provide better health care coverage for Marylanders.  Overall economic growth could be enhanced because small businesses could grow at a greater rate from reduced health care payments, similar to Canada and the UK.","The role the State should not play is return to failed ""war on crime"" strategies of the 80s and 90s like mandatory minimums.  Crime in Baltimore is linked to poverty and a lack of job and entrepreneurial opportunities.  As a lifelong resident of Baltimore City, I am committed to starting a family in the City and promoting its renewal.    The State should assist Baltimore to create an enabling environment for economic growth with jobs, financing for micro and small business enterprise and attracting new industries.  The State can also help to build community center/libraries in different parts of the city similar to what Washington, DC has done.  Police-civilian programs such as Safe Neighborhoods, Police Athletic Leagues and reintroducing neighborhood councils could help keep crime rates down.","Maryland's business climate is improving, but more progress needs to be made to erase the perception that the state is business unfriendly.  Businesses in the Baltimore area complain of worker/skills shortages for their companies.  The state and the private sector must confer with one another to coordinate curriculum and skills training with job opportunities.  This means offering college prep, internships, and apprenticeships to respond to the needs of employers for economic growth.","Yes, I support a non-partisan, independent body to draw legislative and congressional districts.  This is the surest way to instill fairness in the process and avoid gerrymandered districts favoring one party over the other.","The Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights does not adequately provide enough protection for the public, nor does it instill trust between the community and police.  The public believes the police need to be held accountable for their actions, attitudes and behavior.  At this time, I do not believe the bill adequately addresses community fears.","There needs to be more drug awareness and treatment facilities.  Also, naloxone should be made available in more public places.  Funds should be provided to train local police officers, bus drivers, and transit officials.  I support the new anti-opioid prescription drug public service announcements public television has been running.  It is good to warn doctors and their patients to avoid unnecessary pain prescriptions that can lead to addiction or death.","Emphasis should be placed on early childhood education as the first step to close the education gap.  Improvements must be made in teacher training, facility and curriculum upgrades in poor performing schools in lower income areas.  Also, I would promote living wage and equal pay policies to prevent workers from being shortchanged and so they can live in areas near employment.","Elected officials must serve as local advocates and true representatives of the people.  The Public Information Act and Open Meetings Law is a good start, but in today's information technology age government officials have additional resources at their disposal to better inform the public.  As Delegate, I would work to make sure technological resources are deployed to disseminate information as best we can.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

We have to funds within our budget that could be better spent in this area.,I think the Hogan administration has placed too much emphasis on widening major highways rather than improving public transportation. The cancellation of the Red line was a huge disappointment and a missed opportunity to create more revenue while expanding access to thousands of Marylanders. The state needs to find additional ways of connecting Baltimore to the rest of the Washington Metropolitan area aside from the MARC and AMTRAK.,Yes.,"As a state we can't sit back and wait on the Trump administration to do what is right to protect the environment. The Chesapeake Bay is the crown jewel of our state and we must be willing to take the lead on improving the Chesapeake Bay. First, we must make sure that we provide adequate funding in the state budget to the organizations and agencies that are charged with the responsibility of carrying out this restoration effort. Secondly, as residents of the state of Maryland we must all find ways to protect the bay in our own individual ways. For example, we can plant trees, refrain from pouring hazardous substances into storm drains and adapt landscaping techniques that are considered Bay-friendly which reduces pollutants from harming the Chesapeake Bay.","Maryland needs to seriously consider the single payer healthcare system, which would ensure that all of our residents are covered and will decrease administrative costs. The Trump administration has made it very clear that they are committed to either repealing the Affordable Care Act and/or weakening it at the very least and therefore, we as a state must be proactive in establishing universal healthcare for our residents.","The state should play a substantial role in helping Baltimore address violent crime. A few months ago, I wrote a piece discussing the Hogan administration's lack of commitment to providing funding for the Safe Streets program, a Baltimore area program that utilizes felons to go out into the community and engage in conflict resolution to reduce violence. The city of Baltimore has many issues to address and having assistance from the state and strong support from our governor could make a huge difference.","Maryland's business climate has an incredible amount of potential but according to a recent report submitted by the Augustine Commission, there are some concerns that need to be addressed in order to make the state more business friendly and thus, to open up more opportunities for job growth.",Yes.,"There are certain aspects of the LEOBR that I am not in favor of such as the 10 day waiting period before an officer accused of using excessive force can be interrogated by a superior and the fact that officers go before a committee of their peers rather than a citizen review board. I am a supporter of our nation's law enforcement officers however, we must understand that the only way to try and repair the strained relationship between law enforcement and the public is to promote and practice transparency and equal protections under the law. We can't continue to witness these examples of police brutality across the nation and simply ignore these actions just as much as we can't continue to sit by and ignore the crimes being committed by members of the public without implementing new crime reduction procedures.","The opioid addiction and overdose crisis has grown to astronomical numbers. First, we have to focus more on rehabilitation of these individuals rather than just incarcerating them and thinking that they will change their ways upon release. We have to make sure that we are providing adequate funding to our public health agencies that are responsible for combating this growing epidemic.",A recent study showed that it takes 2.5 jobs just for a resident of Maryland to live somewhat comfortably in our state. That issue alone creates a problem before you begin breaking the issue down by demographic. There is a desperate need for job growth in our state and we must keep in mind the statistic mentioned previously because it means that either we need to increase the minimum wage and/or drastically increase the creation of new jobs or else income inequality will just continue to become more prevalent as the years go by. One way to address income inequality is to provide incentives to local businesses who agree to and demonstrate a commitment to hiring individuals who belong to groups that have historically suffered forms of employment discrimination like women and ex-convicts.,I don't think these laws go far enough in promoting transparency and/or making it easier for everyday Marylanders to engage in oversight of their government. I believe that the current scandal surrounding the Prince George's County Public School system is a prime example of why it is extremely important for the general public to have more oversight power.,"Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

The Commission's caution is prudent, given the historical gap between state investment and educational progress.    I fully support the Commission's call to action in response to data showing that Maryland student performance is in the middle of the pack against the rest of the modern world.  The Commission demanded a ""statewide commitment to systemic change"" and their general strategy seems to be sound:  increase the investment in early childhood education, devote resources to at-risk students, transform teaching into a high-status profession with appropriate compensation, promote a linear career pathways system and strengthen the administrative system of governance and accountability.    Most importantly, the Commission acknowledged, and I agree, that addition funding, while necessary, is not alone sufficient to build a globally competitive educational system in Maryland.  I am committed to both sound funding decisions but, more importantly, wise systemic choices to guide that funding.","Maryland's roadways are clearly overwhelmed and there is a need for a well-planned transit system connecting urban areas of our state.  The state's transportation needs are significant and state resources may be insufficient to meet the need without creative, effective alliances.    I support Governor Hogan's approach which contemplates a public-private partnership in key zones to alleviate the suffocating congestion that frustrates Maryland commuters.  This also aligns with the federal approach of government infrastructure investment boosted by additional private sector resources.  There are opportunities to improve transit options throughout Maryland and it is important for everyone involved to make the best use of available funds, make smart choices about which projects to pursue and proceed with care as we invest in Maryland's transportation future.","While I am supportive of the states medical marijuana program and hope tight controls are put in place to ensure only patients with a true medical need are admitted into the program, I do not support the legalization of recreational marijuana.  It is widely acknowledged by all informed parties as a gateway drug.  Permissive recreational use creates a dangerous view of marijuana as a substance without socio-economic impact when, in fact, we know from other states that this path will create dilemmas of public safety and social stability.","There are no new panaceas to the problem of environmental protection and funding shortages are a perennial issue.  Maryland will absolutely need to renew its commitment to proven methodologies – funding clean-up efforts, restraining pollution sources and prioritizing environmental stewardship.    Maryland will also need to draw on the energy of its citizens to work in concert towards sustainable policies and interactions with all waterways.  The Chesapeake defines Maryland and every citizen must do his or her part to preserve the Bay.","This is a multi-faceted and complicated issue, with the intersection of so many competing interests and moral implications.  As we work towards the health and well-being of every citizen of Maryland, two policy questions stand out - the regulation of health insurance coverage and the regulation of health care services.    With regard to health insurance coverage, the question is whether states will have impactful authority to regulate health care.  I prefer that local government retain autonomy in these decisions, but the nation is still working through a significant federal intervention in the form of the ACA.  Association health plans (AHP's) are one way for self-employed individuals, as well as small-businesses, to purchase health insurance across state boundaries.  It is my hope that Maryland will a regulatory environment that allows AHP's to compete while protecting our citizens from health care fraud.  We also need to pay attention to the regulation of health care services.  Excessive pricing and overconsumption are two of the major issues impacting our ability to provide affordable coverage to every citizen.    Maryland should look to the overwhelming, unique talent of its physician citizens to step in on these issues.  I suspect that our leading hospitals and their medical teams have a pretty good grasp on how to reduce the costs of health care in our state.  Building a coalition of health care institutions and providers, which leverages our state's unique health care talent, to help manage this component is a good first step.","Baltimore's unique status as Maryland's largest city and arguably the epicenter of our cultural identity means that most of us have a stake in the city.  As a conservative, I tend to support a ""hands-off"" approach but we now have a calamitous violent crime situation in Baltimore that challenges the wisdom of laissez-faire.  The City Council's recent decision to restrain Johns Hopkins from hiring a private police force suggests that efforts to unilaterally seek solutions to the violent crime will be blocked.    And yet, the problem extends beyond the city boundaries.  Our seaport is the second largest in the Mid-Atlantic and Johns Hopkins Hospital is a nationally ranked health care provider.   We offer nine outstanding colleges and universities in Baltimore, including my alma mater, Loyola University.  There are art galleries, theaters, historic sites, parks, recreational sites, monuments, museums, stores and countless other places and institutions that all Marylanders esteem and enjoy.  And all of these Baltimore treasures are also Maryland treasures.  So, I posit that the problem of violent crime is not just a problem for Baltimore to exclusively own anymore.       A solution to violent crime in Baltimore requires committed leadership from four vital corners – city officials, school leaders, local employers, and the police force.  The State of Maryland can and should provide necessary assistance to support and stabilize these four corners.  But the significance of the problem, and the need for a ready solution, means that the state should also consider reform measures, strategic funding and thoughtful intervention.","Maryland's business climate is hardly supportive.  High taxes, excessive regulation and the competition of government jobs versus private sector opportunities create a stressful entrepreneurial environment and deter new business growth.  Economic policy is a choose-your-own-adventure that each state gets to make.  Maryland can certainly stay the course and remain heavy-handed in both taxation and regulation, attempting to regulate the economy by sucking out all available funds and redistributing it according to the politics of the day.  Or, new political leadership in Maryland can pivot to a marketplace approach that reduces reliance on government intervention and allows a free economy to self-regulate to a practicable extent.    Before making this decision (and, more to the point, placing a vote), I suggest that everyone consider the demographic trends of states with the marketplace approach – Florida and Texas, for example – and compare that to the trends in the heavy-handed states such as New York and New Jersey. The decision seems simple from my vantage point.",Yes.  It is entirely reasonable to expect that an independent body would draft more maps that were actually fair and reasonable rather than those that obviously preserved the political status quo.,"Police Officers serve a unique function in society and deserve the special layer of due process protections afforded by the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights which is codified in fourteen states, including Maryland.  These protections allow them to undertake the uniquely specialized tasks of their work which require the latitude to handle difficult and dangerous situations through coercive, and discretionary, force.  Police officers insist that these enhanced due process provisions are necessary to allow officers to protect the public without undue concern about unfair scrutiny in order to best protect the community.  Activists counter that the authority to use coercive force necessitates an enhanced level of scrutiny to best protect the community, and that police officers who misuse their authority are not held appropriately accountable because of their enhanced due process.  Police accountability is the subject of intense debate now, and civil right proponents have long recommended the institution of citizen oversight agencies, such as a civilian review board, to ensure adequate disciplinary processes.  Police officers are owed a certain degree of deference in light of the significant rules, stresses and dangers of their job. The majority of the LOEBR provisions are consistent with standard due process and pose no obstacle to police accountability.  A refinement of the LOEBR code, however, would go a long way to restoring the public's trust in fairness and the rule of law as it relates to our police force.  Careful, considered amendments to LOEBR would ameliorate the transparency issue that the police force currently faces.",Aggressively targeting Heroin and Opioid suppliers and ensuring laws are in place to ensure they serve adequate jail time for the pain and suffering they have inflicted on our Community.    It is important we provide access to affordable treatment options for addicts and their families. This is truly a medical condition that needs to addressed with additional medical resources geared toward treating mental health.,Wealth redistribution through government intervention is the fundamental socio-economic ideology of the left and has proven time and time again to be disastrous.  It is the underpinning of the Marxist doctrine that America has long opposed.    The formidable combination of a capitalist system coupled with our fundamental freedoms are sufficient to address income inequality.  State investment in infrastructure and education are appropriate uses of tax dollars to create a conducive environment for every person to succeed.,I support transparency and suggest that government operate in an open environment unless it compromises individual protections or national defense.,"Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

I then double majored in History and Political Science at the University of Wisconsin.","I most recently worked as a Senate Floor reporter for CQ Roll Call.  I had previously worked as a political consultant, and as an intern for Sen. Chris Van Hollen, Reps. Steny Hoyer and Anthony Brown, and Gov. Martin O'Malley.","I support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education and would commit to funding the associated reforms if Montgomery County's schools are adequately funded by the state.  This may require a higher percentage of the $2.9 billion in increased funding to come from the state than originally suggested.  I would pay for the increases with carbon pricing.  Based on a Brookings Institute study, charging $40 per metric ton of carbon (about 1/5th of carbon's cost on society) could fund almost the entirety of the increase.","The Baltimore region should be better served by public transit, though representing Montgomery County, assuming Metro is fully funded, my top priority is transportation spending that helps alleviate traffic on I-270 and I-495.  This could include creating two reversible lanes on I-270 during rush hour.","I do support the legalization of recreational marijuana.  Using Colorado as a model, this reform could generate $200 million of additional revenue per year.","Climate change is the existential crisis that is facing the Bay.  Though there are certainly steps that are needed in order to protect the Bay in the short term, I believe carbon pricing is the single best way to curb climate change and save the Bay in the long term.","My plan is a Premium Reducing Medicare Option, a public option for anyone that doesn't have insurance and isn't eligible for Medicaid or for people whose exclusion from the health pool will decrease everyone else's premiums; specifically, anyone aged 55 and older or people with certain pre-existing conditions.  This plan would be great for those that would have a public option, and for those that do not, risk would be reduced in the marketplace, which should drive down prices and hopefully create more competition with new insurance companies joining the individual market.","I believe that the state should provide funding in order to help reduce violent crime, though I believe that localities, as hyper-local as a neighborhood, are best able to find solutions to crime that work best for their community.","We should always be looking to improve our state's business climate and help create middle-class jobs.  Maryland has the opportunity to be the first state in the country to adopt carbon pricing.  This holy grail of environmentally policy should help attract green energy companies to the state, especially if coupled with tax credits for these companies or perhaps a slightly lower corporate tax rate.","There is a need for gerrymandering reform, though I would like to see it done at the Federal or Judicial level.","I believe that there needs to be a better balance in order to protect the public while also maintaining essential protections for our hardworking law enforcement officers.  One reform that would create a better balance is for officers that are under investigation to be questioned as soon as possible, though after they have their attorney.  Another policy upgrade would be having a longer statute of limitations on excess force complaints.","I am hopeful that medicinal marijuana will help alleviate the over-prescribing of opioids, cutting off addiction at the root.  Though I would prefer to see most drug usage crimes decriminalized, I believe that there should be strict penalties for deadly drugs like Fentanyl.  Maryland should also expand options for rehabilitation, including for people in the criminal justice system.","The state should increase the minimum wage to match Montgomery County's.  Additionally, the state should require companies to file salaries with the state in order to ensure equal pay for equal work.","No, current laws don't adequately ensure the public's ability to exercise oversight over the government.  The floor of both chambers should be available live on video and committee work should also be available for live viewing.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education? Are you committed to funding associated reforms, and if so, how?","Is Maryland’s transportation spending appropriately balanced between roads and transit?

The implementation of the recommendations will begin to be debated in January, 2019, by the Maryland General Assembly.  As a former Howard County Board of Education member and current Howard Community College Trustee, I have the experience to hit the ground running and make well-informed decisions on educational priorities and funding sources.  Expansion of early childhood education is critical to increasing success of students.  Teachers must be highly qualified and compensated.  We must provide career and college pathways earlier in school than we do now.  We must prepare students who are ready to take on the technology, research, and healthcare jobs that are in demand. Additional resources must be provided for at risk students and there must be an accountability system in place for the measurement of the impact of the recommendations.  I am committed to funding these reforms which  will come both from an increased investment by the state, and a redirection of present education expenditures to the recommendations and new priorities. Casino funding was supposed to be used for additional education, not to supplant existing funds and that must and will be corrected.  Other funding sources will be evaluated.  I am not in favor of increasing income taxes, but believe there are corporate loopholes that can be closed to generate additional funding for education.","While investment in roads must be part of the solution, sufficient investment in transit is paramount to solving our long-term traffic congestion challenges.  The cancellation of the Red Line left Baltimore without a future-oriented solution.  BaltimoreLink is an attempt at improving MTA bus routes, and we must continue to have a dynamic system where government and MTA are constantly evaluating efficiencies where speed, frequency, access, walkability, and reliability are the measures of effectiveness.  The state must develop a more comprehensive plan to manage our transportation needs throughout Maryland.  We must have funding available to provide basic infrastructure maintenance and upgrades to bridges, and roads, while also investing in transit.  If the state is to be competitive in the economic development arena, elevate opportunities for all citizens and lessen income inequality, a plan for more comprehensive transit must be developed, along with a plan to fund it.","I would first support an analysis of the impact in other states where recreational marijuana is legal so that if Maryland does proceed, it does so informed by the initial efforts of other states.   I am open to supporting a program of legalization with strong checks and balances protecting young people as well as an educational initiative. I advocate for a change in the federal law to allow research studies on the use of marijuana and how it affects people short and long term","First, I believe we should do everything we can to make sure that we do not lose federal funding of the Chesapeake Bay Fund, by lobbying our congressional contacts in Maryland and in other states.  My hope is that voters will consider protecting the federal funding for the Chesapeake Bay, a litmus test for candidates.  States and federal agencies have committed to specific pollution reduction targets by 2025 and meeting those targets is critical not only to the health of the bay, but to the economy that depends on the bay.   While agricultural runoff is a large source of pollution in the bay, unmitigated stormwater runoff, wastewater treatment and rural septic systems also negatively impact the bay. I support amending the Forest Conservation Act, which currently requires planting only a quarter acre of new trees for every acre of trees cleared, to require more tree replacement with a high-end goal of a one-to-one ratio.  I support use of best available technology for wastewater treatment and new septic systems and increasing incentives to farmers to create better buffers near streams and waterways. The science is clear, and the efforts put forth by the state thus far have been successful as the ""State of the Bay Health Index"" has improved by over 6 percent in the most recent published score.  We cannot afford to go backwards and must build on the progress that has been made since 2010 with or without federal participation.","I believe that access to health care is a universal right.  Maryland must be at the forefront of innovation in health care delivery to be able to expand care and reduce costs.  Reduction of costs is the major benefit of a single payer system as overhead is reduced and savings is provided back to the patients.  This type of system would require waivers from the federal government to roll programs together as well as major investment in healthcare administrative infrastructure.  Ultimately, I believe a plan to do this over a period of years is achievable.   In the meantime, should the federal government make the Affordable Care Act null, the state must step in as it did this year in shoring up the state health exchange and providing an alternative to Marylanders.  The state could consider a model used in Howard County in previous years, Healthy Howard, which provided access to healthcare for the residents who made too much money to qualify for Medicaid but could not afford health insurance.  Innovation in administrative systems, healthcare delivery, patient care and follow up, is necessary to reduce costs and make healthcare more affordable and available for everyone.","The State's role in helping Baltimore address violent crime is to support to the city's implementation of evidence-based violence reduction measures, to help fund community initiatives such as the successful Safe Streets program, and to help improve the public-school system to provide career and college readiness for young people and expanded opportunities for employment.  The state must make sure that laws are in place to appropriately sentence repeat violent offenders to keep them off the streets, as well as support strong rehabilitation programs for all offenders. To be successful in reducing violent crime, it is imperative that state officials act in partnership with city officials in developing the best methods to attack this public safety problem that leads to successful, sustainable outcomes and continuous improvement.","Many jobs exist in cyber security, genomics, data analysis, robotics and the healthcare field that provide a living wage for families.  Not all jobs in these areas require a college education. The state can encourage professional development and certification programs to fill these employment needs within state agencies and at community colleges.  Implementing the recommendations of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education will help schools reset career and college readiness goals to meet the needs of these growth industries. I would characterize Maryland's Business Climate with a grade of B- and believe that there are more opportunities to be realized through the partnership of state and local jurisdictions, with educational institutions, and the private sector to provide qualified workers for the growth industries of the future.","Yes, to reduce polarization of the electorate and encourage bipartisanship, gerrymandering must end.","The Law Enforcement Bill of Rights is intended to provide due process to law enforcement officers under internal investigation.  I believe a review is indicated to evaluate the protections that are in place and whether those protections meet the goal of due process to the officer, without sacrificing a strong investigative process that provides justice.","The single most effective thing the state can do to address the opioid crisis is to direct resources to long-term residential treatment programs in Maryland.  We must create a system based on treatment on demand to get addicts into treatment as soon as they ask, so they no longer have to endure long waiting lists.  Maryland needs detox, medical and counseling programs in greater numbers to provide treatment to addicts in their home state.  No one treatment program fits all, and so there must be a continuum of programs available. The State must continue to work to reduce unnecessary pain prescriptions from the medical and dental communities. No teenager should become a heroin addict because the oral surgeon provided 30 OxyContin pills, yet this has happened in our community.   Increasing access and availability of mental health treatment, as well as mental health screenings in adolescence would also be beneficial in preventing substance abuse.","There are several contributing factors to the increasing income inequality in Maryland and across the country.  Maryland must implement the recommendations of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence to provide an environment in public education that provides all students with opportunities for college and career readiness with highly qualified and compensated teachers.  Providing quality pre-Kindergarten programs is correlated with increased rate of high school graduation, college attendance and higher earnings.  Additionally, providing transit opportunities so that people can reach employment centers and earn a family sustaining wage is imperative.  The state should support local jurisdictions in affordable housing efforts and continue to work on a health care system that reduces overall costs as both will bring stability to families with lower incomes.","The Public Information Act was updated in 2015 by establishing a public information compliance board, as well as an ombudsman to mediate complaints when fees charged by government agencies exceed a certain limit. Another key change is that a report is required of the Attorney General's office that evaluates the implementation of the law and the outcomes.  One issue that can stand as a barrier to Marylanders ability to exercise oversight are the fees that agencies can charge for producing documents.  We need to be sure that excessive fees are not charged, as well as monitor the new process, that has been in effect for a few years, with the compliance board to determine if additional substantive changes would help improve transparency and appropriately further the goal of government oversight by the citizens and the media.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education? Are you committed to funding associated reforms, and if so, how?","Is Maryland’s transportation spending appropriately balanced between roads and transit?

According to the Commission's Preliminary report, Maryland could achieve much progress with a 10% increase in school funding, which could come from casino revenue if the amendment to that effect is passed.  Investment in education pays off in the long term. Productivity, reduction in crime and enhanced quality of life all are made possible by better schools.","The cancellation of the Red Line was a terrible blunder. It would have decreased average commute times and cut down on pollution. Turning down federal money designed to help our region made no sense. It would be difficult for any state to fully fund such a project without federal help.       By most accounts, BaltimoreLink is only a small upgrade to existing bus service.  Until funds are found to replicate the Red Line, the state should continue to upgrade bus service and add lines so that Marylanders will see the bus as a reliable and pleasant alternative to the automobile. This upgrade would help even when the Red Line is built in future. Funds could be found in the recent increase in state revenue, a modest gas tax increase, or a ""millionaire's tax.""","The prohibition of marijuana has been a failure. It has funded organized crime and subjected too many young people to imprisonment and the lifetime handicaps that follow. Marijuana should be regulated like alcohol.       In a perfect world, no one would use either drug. In our imperfect world, however, we should control its ill effects as best we can and use the revenue it produces for the common good.","We should require a higher percentage of clean, renewable energy production in Maryland. This would lower nitrogen and mercury levels in the bay and make progress towards slowing the global problem of climate change.       Baltimore City faces a major upgrade to its sewer system and deserves more help from the state in that endeavor. An upgraded system would decrease the levels of raw or partially treated sewage that creates ""dead zones"" in our bay. We should also continue to require poultry growers and processors to take responsibility for the waste their animals produce and help them find better ways to use it.","A national single payer system is the best solution. The savings for all would be enormous and breaking the link between employment and insurance would stimulate job creation. Until we get there, we in Maryland can move toward a state wide single payer system. Politically, that would be very tough, potentially setting off a political ""tax war."" Some experts like Vincert DeMarco, reject the idea.       Another way to get there is to build on our current system. Maryland currently regulates rates charged by hospitals, a policy that has saved hundreds of millions. If that kind of regulation was expanded to include doctors, clinics and drug suppliers, we could get many of the benefits of single payer without turning our system upside down. Some European countries have used this method to provide affordable health care for their people.","I support the Commission to Restore Trust in Policing, set up to investigate recent corruption allegations. A balanced look at this will help restore public trust and public cooperation with law enforcement. Past that, violent crime is both a short-term and a long-term problem.       One measure to help enforcement would be an expansion of security cameras in the city. I support the increased penalties for witness intimidation that just passed and some increased sentences for adult, repeat violent offenders. Another positive measure would be the legalization of recreational marijuana (see above.)       Expanded addiction treatment is vital, not only for the city, but for the whole state. We need to make mental health a priority so that people currently on the margins can be a productive part of our society. This applies, of course, to those in Maryland prisons. Most inmates are eventually released. Lets give them treatment as needed, plus education and/or training to help them live a productive life.       In the longer term, education is the key to opportunity. We need to give public school kids the means to reach at least the lower rungs of the economic ladder and fair chance to climb higher.","Maryland is a prosperous state where business can thrive. Part of the reason for this is the good services that our local and state government provides. This does mean higher taxes than some states, but the ""high road"" economy is good for business and the public.       Some states take the ""low road"" approach, with low taxes, poor schools and bad infrastructure. Kansas and Oklahoma are struggling with the consequences of that low road now.        I support raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour, indexed to inflation, so that a full time worker can afford to live. Expanded sick leave is a good policy. Prosperous, healthy citizens make good employees and good customers.",".       I do support fair districts. The best solution is a national solution. I hope that the federal courts continue to address this in a positive way.       Most gerrymandering favors Republicans in America. In fact, if you count all votes for the House of Representatives, a clear majority are Democratic. Only gerrymandering created the current Republican majority in the U.S. House.      Having said that, I support districts in Maryland that reflect the will of the voters more accurately. Our current system fosters cynicism, which is poison to democracy.","The Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights gives police a higher degree of protection than the general public. Police deserve protection from unfair prosecution, since they do such a difficult and necessary job. However, the LEOBR has, in practice, impeded some investigations of police misconduct.       I think that police conduct should be judged fairly, by the department, by the courts and by the public. This judgment should be tempered by the awareness that the police do an impossible job under tough conditions. No one is perfect. We need to give police fair consideration when it comes to honest errors made in the heat of the moment. That fair judgment can only come about when all the facts are known. The bill of rights at times made that discovery harder to achieve, so it should be revised.       Revisions should be studied and recommended by legal experts with the goal of bringing all relevant facts to light while treating officers in a fair manner. Public trust in the system is vital.","Addiction is a deep problem in our society that will take time to address.  Law enforcement needs to play its part, hopefully reducing supply and taking dealers out of circulation. We also need expanded treatment opportunities to help addicts find their way out of addiction. Methadone treatment is suitable for many.       This is one area where expanded mental health care could save lives. After a person is revived by Narcan, they should be given access to treatment right away, while still close to death. Unfortunately, there is no magic bullet, but we need to keep studying the problem and working to fix it.","Income inequality in bad for a democracy. When ""we the people"" becomes 'me the person,"" it undermines our ability to work together.       The government can do some thing to make it better.  One is to increase the minimum wage; so all workers can have some degree of prosperity.  Better access to health care and education, regardless of income (see above), also will help to bring us together.  A progressive income tax is a good tool to fund government that also has the effect of bringing us closer economically.","Marylanders have good access to public meetings generally, although they don't use that access nearly enough. Two changes could help. One is better notice of upcoming meetings so more people know about them. The other would be to have more meetings in the evening and on weekends, so working folks can come.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education? Are you committed to funding associated reforms, and if so, how?","Is Maryland’s transportation spending appropriately balanced between roads and transit?

,YES,state-house,40,Melissa Wells,Wells,10/3/1983,Baltimore,Democratic,Baltimore City,http://www.electmelissawells.com,ElectWells,ElectWells?lang=en,http://surveygizmoresponseuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/fileuploads/296249/4297291/99-51a70b606be6dabbd310994caabe7815_MWells817-22.jpg,Masters of Public Policy from American University,"Melissa Wells is a community advocate, labor leader, and financial security specialist. She is a proud Baltimorean and a longtime advocate for neighborhoods in the 40th District.  As a member of the Baltimore-D.C. Building Trades Unions, Melissa works with Baltimore's underserved communities. She helps residents— including women, youth, and returning citizens— find apprenticeships and secure family-supporting careers that provide the stability we all deserve.   Over her career Melissa has worked with federal, state, and local decision makers to bring resources and investments to the 40th district that benefit families across the economic spectrum.  Just and fair inclusion, as well as access to financial security for the most vulnerable,  are key principles that guide Melissa.","I support the Commission's findings, and am committed to fully funding the reforms that addressing its findings will require. I believe we can open significant new revenue streams for education spending by reviving the millionaire's tax that previously existed in Maryland, and by expanding and taxing the legal marijuana market. Some of the Commission's findings can also be addressed, in part, by structural changes to the state's allocation of existing education funds, so that it gives even greater priority to disinvested communities, and finally accounts in full for the impact of Baltimore's TIF usage. I believe the state should also create more sustained partnerships with organized labor and private industry, in order to allow more seamless transitions from classroom to career that may also include cost sharing on the education and training that launches our students into jobs.","No, Maryland's transportation spending is oriented too heavily around highways, which necessarily skews the population served towards more affluent individuals. For many of my constituents in the 40th District, travelling by public transportation is a necessity because car usage is cost prohibitive. That means they need to see more investments not just in buses and bus infrastructure, but in fixed rail transportation, and connective modes of transportation like bicycles that help people move between larger modes of public transit.   Maryland certainly has the resources it needs to properly fund its transportation infrastructure- we just don't use that funding with a proactive eye towards the future, a future that includes ever increasing amounts of public transportation in other cities that we are competing with. That's why ambitious, comprehensive transportation projects like the RedLine are so crucial, and small scale restructuring like BaltimoreLink serves more as a temporary band-aid than a long-term solution. Until the Baltimore Region sees that sort of investment in public transportation, we will continue to be underserved by our transit systems.","Yes, because all available science points towards marijuana being no more harmful than alcohol, and potentially quite helpful for specific health uses. Moreover, it is a tremendous opportunity to generate more revenue for the state to spend on quality of life investments in education and transportation, while also saving significant amounts of money on enforcement costs that are traditionally associated with policing marijuana usage.","A comparatively small industry and population on the Bay- poultry farmers- has been tip-toed around for decades, while the state's only true City- Baltimore- is routinely handled with heavy hands and a disregard for our workers' most important economic interest groups: unions. The disparity in treatment is not tenable, and it should not continue. If we're serious about improving the health of the Bay, it must include serious reform of the poultry industry and the waste it produces in mass quantities. I do not want the poultry industry to bear that financial burden alone though. Similar to my stance on emission heavy industries like trash incineration, I believe the State has an obligation to help subsidize the cost of infrastructure improvements that allow these industries to modernize in a more environmentally friendly direction. Likewise, I believe the state has an obligation to provide training that re-skills industry employees and replaces every job lost because of modernization with a new placement for the worker in an emerging industry that ensures and maintains family-supporting wages and benefits.","I believe that the ""broadest possible access to affordable health care"" can only truly be delivered by a single payer system, which can be implemented and achieved at a state level. I believe that medical professionals should be well-compensated for their important work, but I do not believe healthcare should exist in the form of big businesses with publicly traded stock and corporate boards of directors. Immediate opportunities for improvement include a transition to year round open enrollment in the Maryland Health Exchange, and expanding coverage of both Medicare and Medicaid, particularly when it comes to serving seniors who are seeking to age in place and require services like periodic in-house care.","Resources and personnel are two of the three most important things that the state of Maryland can provide Baltimore, almost irrespective of subject matter area. Crime is no different. Though the State has pledged new funds for violence interruption programs, these investments pale in comparison to the funding spent on conventional arrest tactics. The state should be spending tens of millions annually on programs like Safe Streets, the benefits of which would allow the City of Baltimore to transition more of its police budget towards other needs like education. The State Legislature must also cease to be an impediment to reforming regulations like LEOBOR, which unfairly biases investigations of misconduct towards police officers and away from victims.","Maryland has a high per capita number of millionaires, and those bank accounts are not being generated solely by employment sectors like the Federal Government. Which is to say, of course Maryland's business climate is doing fine. That means any solution to a lack of family-supporting jobs must focus on requiring businesses to pay family-supporting wages, instead of simply increasing the business' bottom line and hoping that the increased profits have a trickle down affect for employees. As such, state support of regulations like a $15 minimum wage would go a long way towards creating more family-supporting jobs in Maryland.","Yes, because I believe that politicians must be willing to do something themselves before they are prepared to ask it of others. If Democrats want redistricting reform in Republican strongholds, they must also be willing to abdicate their own gerrymandered districts in the process.","No, it does not. It skews protections heavily towards police officers, making it extremely difficult to discipline or fire them even after they have engaged in use of force on the job. Requiring civilian participation on misconduct hearing boards, requiring officers to give more timely reports to investigators after engaging in a use of force incident, and creating a formal apparatus for community oversight are each initiatives that LEOBOR and its advocates traditionally block that I'd like to see changed.","I would craft a comprehensive solution for Maryland that seeks to provide urban areas and rural towns alike with access to the same tools. Urban communities have suffered from opioid addiction for years without it being referred to or treated as a crisis, until it began to take hold in the suburbs as well. As such, any programs from the state must treat our urban centers as a priority, not an afterthought. Of course, opioid addiction should be treated as a health issue, not a criminal offense, and the success rate of treatment programs is consistently higher when they are located in an individual's current community. Moreover, states that have legalized marijuana have consistently seen lower uses of opioids, in no small part because of marijuana's ability to help people manage chronic pain.","The state has an important obligation to address income inequality, because it has such a tremendous impact on Marylanders' qualities of life. We agree to pay taxes and be governed under the premise that the resulting government will improve our qualities of life. Creating baseline wage guarantees through a $15 minimum wage and stronger prevailing wage guarantees are obvious first steps towards decreased inequality, but increased funding for public schools and better onramps from high school to college or career are just as important in their own right to improve income inequality for successive generations. Understood that way, embracing the Kirwin Commission's recommendations goes hand-in-hand with supporting a $15 minimum wage, in that each offers an important opportunity to address income inequality on a massive scale.","No, because many Marylanders would not know what to look for in a PIA request.

Current student of Nazarene bible college, (B.A.Min.) program.","Founder and Senior Pastor of Faith Empowered Ministries in Baltimore, MD.","Yes, I  support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education. I am committed to funding associated reforms because strong schools benefit children and their families. When elected I will work to support bills like (House Bill 1415) which will bring Maryland's schools up to first class status.","The performance of Maryland's transportation system is a critical component in the overall success of our state economy. $5.9 billion in the annual budget (FY 2018) I don't believe that it is a matter of money, I think it is a matter of accountability and prioritizing.  When elected my bill transportation for all will require the  State of Maryland to fund accessible transportation in Baltimore City to surrounding places of employment. *Everyone deserves the opportunity to work, but, if you are able to find a job but cannot get there on time; it is the same as not having a job at all. Many residents are unable to venture to other areas for employment due to the unreliable transportation system in Baltimore City. Throughout downtown and popular neighborhoods, there is access to free transportation. In the most adverse neighborhoods affected by the lack of transportation; free transportation services are not being offered. As  Delegate, it is my role to give the people a voice, and a resolution.","No I do not support the  legalization of recreational marijuana. The state of Maryland should also recognize legalization for what it is: the large-scale commercialization and marketing of an addictive — and therefore highly profitable — substance.  In states that have legalized marijuana, youth usage now exceeds the national average, the black market continues to thrive and employers struggle with more drug-impaired workers than before marijuana was legalized.  More heavy users of marijuana are reporting to drug treatment, and there have been more school infractions among kids caught with marijuana. Worse still, the only statistically representative national survey on marijuana use found last year that Colorado is the No. 1 state for youth marijuana use in the country.  Without action, the marijuana industry is poised to become the next Big Tobacco — a profit-hungry special-interest group looking after profits, not public health. Legislatures in Maryland need to acknowledge that marijuana comes with its own set of health risks, including a strong link to psychosis and schizophrenia, memory loss and low academic achievement.","Now is not the time to remove our focus on restoration. Maryland has a responsibility to help restore the Bay.  However, the fact remains that we cannot restore this national treasure without the support of the Federal government both financially and with multiple agency technical assistance. We have to clean up Maryland's waterways, invest in open space preservation, better coordinate resources to address the effects of sea level rise and improve outdoor recreational activities.","There is no shortage of proposed solutions, but the idea that health care needs more competition. In other sectors of the economy, competition improves quality and efficiency, spurs innovation, and drives down costs. Health care should be no exception.","The control of crime is a difficult, complicated task, requiring deep commitment and day-to-day involvement by State government. It seem as if Maryland have not assumed that full role. We must assume that role in the future having involvement, financial resources, geographic spread, and political leadership. Blending, and working together properly; Federal government, State government, and Local government. Most importantly it matters to those who elect us.  Crime control in Maryland is in trouble, however its performance is measured. Statistics, public opinion, political leadership, official agencies - our antennae - all tell us that strengthened state action, including new state agency structures and stronger leadership of local efforts, represents the most promising direction for major improvement of crime control in Maryland.","Over the past few years some businesses have found success when opening in Maryland, while others have been forced to shut down due to crime and other factors. From day one, when I decided to run for delegate, my top priority has been how can I help create jobs and opportunity for middle class Maryland families.  I have traveled in the district to hear from educators, entrepreneurs, workers, and families about how I can help create jobs and grow the economy. Their thoughts and ideas outlined a series of common sense, bipartisan steps – ranging from doubling down on investments in innovation and job training, to streamlining government programs – that Maryland can take to help small business owners and middle class families achieve their goals.","Yes, I support the creation of a non-partisan, independent body to draw legislative and congressional district maps after each census. I think that efforts to reduce elected officials control over the redistricting are to be praised.  I really do hope that their efforts would gained far more traction then it has already.","It is far from a fanciful concern that the police will take advantage of all the extra due process they get under Maryland law to concoct an alternative version of events. Currently superiors may not question their officers for 10 days following an incident. Not only are officers entitled to an attorney, union attorneys are usually available to them immediately. There is no need for an additional waiting period. Ten days simply impedes investigation and significantly delays the ability of police departments to communicate effectively with the public about what happened. Several changes are still needed to bring the statute in line and bring balance. We need systemic reform, which will ensure that ""bad apples"" on any police force are addressed while fostering a culture of trust and accountability that could reduce police abuse overall.","To effectively address the opioid epidemic, Maryland must adopt and Improve opioid addiction treatment, Improve addiction care in the criminal justice system. When we make this investment will not only be able to overcome the current opioid epidemic but also will be in a better position to prevent or face down future drug crises.","If the private market fails to provide enough jobs to achieve full employment, the government must become the employer of last resort. We must support sectoral training, apprenticeships, and earn-while-you-learn programs. another resolution would be to raise the minimum wage to $12/hour by 2020 and raise the overtime salary threshold (beneath which all workers get overtime pay) from $455/week to $970/week and index it to inflation.","No. Whenever a public body meets in open session, the general public is entitled to attend. That means that members of the public may come to a meeting and observe it. With one exception pertaining to the closing of a meeting , it does not mean that they are entitled to speak. The ability to ""observe"" does not mean that the public body must provide to the audience copies of the documents being reviewed by the members. the state's Public Information Act and open meetings laws gives little room for Marylanders' to exercise oversight of the government.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

(Parkville Senior High – 1982).  When I graduated from high school, my mother could not afford to pay for college, yet that didn't stop me from pursuing an education. I received several scholarships and worked full time while attending Towson State University.   Unfortunately, while in 1986 while working full time and living on my own, it became too difficult to attend classes full time.  Yet finishing college never stopped being a personal dream.  In 2004 with two young children of my own, I planned to go back to school.  As we were lining up resources to make this possible, the tenant in the rental property my husband and I owned; moved out. With a second mortgage to pay, it seemed I would have to put my education on hold again. Instead, my mother came to me and said that she wished she could have afforded to pay for my schooling when I first pursued a college degree.  As a single parent with limited resources she was unable to do so at the time. ""I couldn't then, but I can now,"" she told me.  With her help, I returned to school.  In December of 2010, I graduated Magna Cum Laude with a Bachelors of Business Administration from Strayer University. A Harford Leadership Academy graduate (1993), I also completed the Academy for Excellence in Governance through the University of Maryland's School of Public Policy in 2017","I have been employed by a medical eye care practice, Advanced Eye Care located in Bel Air MD since 2012.   I am also currently serving as a Havre de Grace City Councilwoman, first elected in 2015 and re-elected in 2017.  For the past 35+ years, I have worked in both the private and public sector.  I have worked for local government, public safety, hospitality, restaurants and tourism and am currently employed in the healthcare field.  I have owned and operated my own business.       From 2007 to 2012, I served as the Public Information Officer for the Harford County Sheriff's Office.   In the mid 90's, I served as the Economic Development and Tourism Coordinator for the City of Havre de Grace's Department of Planning.  I spent over 25 years of my career in the hotel/restaurant and tourism industry.  My career in food service began in the early 80's at Burger King.  I finished my career in hotels/restaurants as the Vice President of Hess Hotels Group and owner of Charley's Grilled Subs and Wholly Cow Ice Cream in Edgewood MD. I have served in leadership roles on a myriad of state and local boards, commission and committees to include Harford County Chamber of Commerce, Havre de Grace Chamber of Commerce, Maryland Tourism Council, Harford County Tourism, Harford County Economic Development Advisory Board, the Route 40 Business Association and the Susquehanna Workforce Network to name a few.","While I applaud the work and findings presented by the Kirwan Commission to date, I am not fully convinced that it is ready to present for consideration.   I find the study to be a forward thinking model and worthy aspiration for our educational system.  My concern is that it is not founded in fiscal reality.  I would not support its implementation unless it could be fully funded.  I would not support the study, if the only solution was to push the costs on to our counties.  We cannot continue to pass on unfunded mandates. That being said, there are several elements of the study that I do believe could be implemented more cost effectively than others.   Specifically   1) more even distribution of  school funding to counties with a requirement to report back on dollars spent,  2) Increased early educational programs beginning as early as age three,  3) improving the Career and Training Education programs so that students meet employment standards in a rewarding career after graduating high school, in addition to being ready to enter an open enrollment post secondary institution,   4) restructuring of compensation for teacher and school leaders so that can be compensated more as they improve their skills and take on more responsibility.  Before we can move forward there needs to be more education to the educators about the results of the commission with adequate time to comment and weigh in on the findings presented.","There's an old saying that you can't build your way out of congestion.  One does, however, need to meet the needs that currently exist.  While determining what public transportation options are most critical, it is important to look at all geographic areas individually and not focus on only one or two areas.   There is no one size fits all for our infrastructure needs.  If the qualities of our roads are sub-standard, then that road needs to be prioritized.   Even most public transportation options will be using the road systems in some form or another.    As an individual aspiring to represent Harford County in Annapolis, I don't see a balance in spending levels across the State.   As a smaller county with a large number of drivers and out bound commuters, we are faced with the challenge of attending to our existing roads.  I agreed with Governor's Hogan plan to shut down the Red Line project and was pleased to see the Highway User Funds (HURs) restored for counties and municipalities.  Permanently restore municipal highway user revenues (HURs), not only to meet current road maintenance needs, but more importantly, provide a long-term, stable funding source for local transportation projects.   It's time to stop delaying projects that improve the condition of our roads.    Our State's investment in infrastructure, like roads and transportation, is the key to creating good job and promoting economic stability.  Roads and transportation are worth the investment.",No,"I live at the top of the Chesapeake Bay in Havre de Grace.  Not only is it is our City's water supply, it is an economic driver and treasure that must be protected.   I have seen firsthand that the challenges we face with bay protection are often not of our own making.   Our state neighbors' lack of regulation to protect the Chesapeake Bay Watershed affects us downstream.   One only has to stand by the Susquehanna River after a severe storm to see the debris that washes down from Pennsylvania, and New York.   As a collaborator by nature, I would work to build relationships with my legislative counterparts in an effort to encourage them to strengthen their regulations by creating awareness for the damage they are causing.  I would continue to support existing grants programs that would work in partnership with local businesses, museums and residents situated along the shores. I would support legislation that helped our waterman continue to earn their living on the Bay.   It's time to make the Bay sexy again; think celebrity endorsements.  By adding funding to the Office of Tourism's  marketing budget, we could promote bay activities and stories, especially to the states mentioned above.  People take care of what they love most.  They key is to make our Bay the most loved attribute we have.","I support equity in reimbursement for Medicaid and Medicare, as well as payment parity for telemedicine.  Our citizens are being overburdened with co-pays, deductibles and premiums.   The insurance pricing models are confusing for patients and providers alike.    Did you know that because of reimbursement guidelines, patients may not receive diagnostic testing or certain procedures on the same day as an exam?  The unintended consequence is that now healthcare providers bring patients back for additional testing and procedures on a different day than their exam.  While originally designed to be a cost saving measures, this ill thought out decision creates inefficiencies for healthcare providers and cost patients more in co-pays, deductibles and lost wages - more steps, more cost and more time for everyone involved.      Supporting initiatives that support wellness and promote public health are critical investments.  However Maryland is the only state in the country with the ""Medicare Waiver"" in place.  Under the revamped waiver, all of Maryland's hospitals must operate under fixed global budgets.  This means that they must care for all of their patients within the limits set by the Health Services Cost Review Commission. The goal is to provide incentives to keep people healthy and treat them in the most appropriate lowest cost setting.  Unfortunately, we are seeing our rural hospitals close as a result. This means patients have to travel further for their healthcare needs.  The business of medicine is complex and we need to see more practitioners involved in the decision making processes.","I believe Governor Hogan got it right in December 2017,  when he rolled out his plan to fight violent crime in Baltimore City.   (http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/bs-md-hogan-crime-transcript-20171205-story.html) To combat gang/drug related violent crimes in Baltimore City, I readily support Governor Hogan's initiatives.  We need the toughest legislation possible to keep those involved in gang and drug related violent crimes off the streets.     ""It is critical for our state to have an intelligence-sharing infrastructure in place, which will allow law enforcement officials to develop timely, accurate and actionable intelligence, which will produce more arrests, more convictions and more incarcerations of these violent criminals for longer periods of time.""  Excerpt from Governor Hogan Crime Plan transcript.    I support the creation of the Governor's council on Gangs and Violent Criminal Networks.  Crime knows no boundaries, so shared resources and knowledge would benefit all jurisdictions - not just Baltimore City. It's time to get tough on crime.","I would characterize Maryland's business climate as strong and moving in the right direction, with the exception of HB1 passed earlier this year.   Small business constitutes a major force in our economy.  Aside from contributions to our general economic well-being, founders of small businesses also contribute to growth and vitality in specific areas of economic and socioeconomic development. In particular, small businesses Create jobs, Spark innovation and Provide opportunities for many people, including women and minorities, to achieve.   We need to review and remove excessive legislation and restrictions that hinders businesses' ability to grow and expand.  Small businesses are collectively the leader in job creation. As Maryland's perception as an unfriendly business state begins to change for the first time in many years, we need to be prepared to help employers find qualified employees.  We need to work with our local community colleges and work force development boards to prepare job seekers with the skills employers need.  By addressing innovative workforce strategies, we can contribute to advancing and growing the competitiveness of our region and creating a better quality of life for businesses, workers, jobseekers.",Yes,Yes I do believe that LEOBR adequately balances the protection for police and the public.  I do not believe it should be changed at this time.,"Unfortunately, I believe the problem is continuing to rise and we have yet to reach a plateau regarding this problem.  The Governor has declared a State of Emergency.  I have heard the Opioid Crisis referred to as ""a serial killer in our midst"". I agree wholeheartedly with these statements.   We need to continue to focus our time, energy and resources combating this problem from many directions.   I support creating opportunities for the medical/addiction recovery community and law enforcement community to meet and discuss the pros and cons of proposed solutions.  I support introducing awareness of the topic at the elementary school level. Middle school is too late.  I support increased penalties for convicted drug dealers. Last but not least, I believe we need to partner with the medical community to reduce the amount of medication prescribed for chronic pain or pain prevention.","With the exception of the State monitoring its own hiring, and wages paid to State employees, there is little that I believe we should be doing legislatively to address income inequality.    The exception to my statement above is that I would support legislation in barring employers from asking job candidates about their previous salary history or benefits.   Women often have historically lower salaries than males for similar jobs, in part due to discrimination.  By eliminating that specific question on an employee application, we could make a positive impact in addressing pay equity issues without overburdening the private sector.",Yes,"Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

We should fund associated reforms that appropriately match long term improvements.,"A sizable amount of resources should reflect the fact that roughly 90% of transportation in Maryland uses the vast network of highways and roads. Our current budget does not take this into consideration.  According to Maryland's 2017 Operating Budget Allowance by Mode (Total Spending: $1.9 Billion), the Transit Administration receives 41 % of the budget while the State Highway Administration receives only 14%.  Since Maryland commuter time is ranked as the longest (worst) in the nation according to the US Census Bureau, we need to stop ignoring this problem. Despite the transportation revenue increases passed in 2013, Maryland's ability to fund its transportation programs falls well short of identified needs. The impact on Baltimore hurts both commuter travel and transit.","In an atmosphere of recanting the evils of smoking over the last 60 years, it seems arguably wrong-headed to unleash recreational use of marijuana as a healthy advancement to society.","Chesapeake Bay restoration is not the sole domain of Maryland.  In what should be a state consortium to achieve proper stewardship of our national resource, Maryland should take the lead and advocate for a cooperative effort with adjoining states to include promoting public awareness and participation in the restoration and protection of the water quality and aquatic and land resources of the Chesapeake Bay region.","Lowering the price of health care would insure the broadest access for the public to acquire and sustain health coverage in Maryland.  Currently there are only two providers in support of the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare), Care First and Kaiser Permanente. Greater competition would greatly slash costs if there were more health care providers in Maryland.  Allowing purchase of insurance across state lines would add a major boost in this direction.  At the root of the problem is the soaring cost for insurance plans purchased on the individual market, which has skyrocketed, increasing by 10 to 50 percent each year. Without state intervention, health insurance premiums would rise by so much next year that it would cause the Affordable Care Act in Maryland to implode.  Although lawmakers in the General Assembly are working quickly to avert the crisis by agreeing on a new $380 million tax to stabilize the individual insurance market, a long range fix is needed. Governor Hogan is creating a negotiating team to work with a group of Democratic leaders to find a solution. We need to support this as it is the only viable effort in sight.",The City of Baltimore has the best overview and authority to address violent crime.  The state should be in a defensible position for the citizens of Baltimore should the city request assistance.,"In 2017, Maryland had the best year for business in 15 years and the best year for job growth in a decade according to Governor Hogan. Maryland went from losing 100,000 jobs to gaining more than 110,000 jobs and ranked fourth among 50 states for entrepreneurial business growth. The state is on the right track to foster additional business growth that would truly extend to the family oriented market.","Redistricting is the process by which new congressional and legislative district boundaries are drawn.  District lines are redrawn every 10 years following completion of the United States Census. The federal government stipulates that districts must have nearly equal populations and must not discriminate on the basis of race or ethnicity. In Maryland, the primary authority to draw both congressional and state legislative district lines rests with the state legislature. I support Governor Hogan's effort to create a non-partisan, independent commission to draw districts that more fairly represent the community's interests within a geographic area.  Even though his bill was killed last year, it should be seen as viable alternative over previous efforts to redistrict the state.","The Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights is intended to balance protection for police and the public. As of April 2015, Maryland passed legislation to codify their own variations of this Bill of Rights.  Since the Bill provides extra rights to the police not afforded to the public a new review should be undertaken.","The strategy as developed by Governor Hogan in establishing the Heroin and Opioid Emergency Task Force has the hallmarks of effectively addressing a Maryland health crisis.  Heroin and Opioid drug dependency surged in Maryland over the last decade, resulting in an urgent and growing public health threat affecting all demographics and geographical settings in Maryland. This strategy will help focus state and community resources to irradiate this threat.",When a street cleaner earns the same wages as a brain surgeon than the inequality is in the services rendered.  Some jobs have more value than others.,"As the Vice-Chair of the DC Metroplex BWI Community Roundtable Working Group (a Maryland movement dedicated to resolving excessive aircraft noise pollution), I can speak with first hand knowledge that the Public Information Act and conducting open meetings more than adequately ensures  Marylanders' ability to exercise oversight of the government.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

I will work with stakeholders to create and fund the recommended diverse delivery system of universal pre-k for all 4-year-olds and work to expand the network of Judy Centers and Family Support Centers. We must invest in early childhood education and developmental services for young students so that they are best equip to succeed.  Further, I will work to eliminate the pay gap between teachers and other high-status professions of similar education requirements. Teaching must be viewed and treated as a professional class occupation. Failure to do so will continue teacher attrition.   Third, I will work to expand career pathways for students and provide for free community college. This allows for young adults to be able to transition more completely from high school into post-secondary education and life.   I will work to increase spending in economically disadvantaged school districts. Maryland spends 5% more on wealthy districts than poor ones according to the commission. This is a regressive statistic. We must provide added support to students who need it.   Finally, I believe we must also work to reduce class sizes for all grade levels. Classes should have no more than 25 students for effective instruction and learning.","Maryland does not appropriately balance spending for transportation. We spend more money on roads that mass transit. In Baltimore, the BaltimoreLink is at best a lateral step from the old system.   The state must fund a comprehensive and integrated subway system in Baltimore to enhance economic growth and fully take advantage of Baltimore's proximity to other major cities in the region. This system would require significant investment from the state and federal government. It would stand to connect the entire city to itself and DC. People would more easily get to their workplaces faster. Piecemeal projects are helpful but a bold plan and investment is required.  Furthermore, unlike the light rail which essentially uses the honor system to collect fares, a subway system collects fares more dependably. More people, especially in the working class, are willing to use a subway system than will ride a bus or a light rail. Subway systems pay for themselves, subsidize other modes of transport, moves Baltimore into the next century of transportation, and will spur population growth as the city becomes more accessible.   Additionally, the opportunity of high-speed rail should be thoroughly explored.","Yes. Legalization of marijuana benefits the state by reducing drug offenses for residents, expands liberty, and increases tax revenue, which can be used on infrastructure, healthcare, and education.","I support the use of Environmental Impact Bonds to assist in the construction of ""Green Infrastructure"" to reduce storm water runoff from impervious surfaces. These bonds can help spur development and redevelopment of infrastructure and buildings in ways that increase green space, reduce pollution, and improve community ascetics and property value.","I support a single payer health system to provide universal healthcare for all.   Maryland should expand the efforts to provide telehealth services to communities. This will allow for better access to treatment, specialty care and will reduce travel, especially for seniors living in rural areas.  We should also work to improve health literacy especially for communities of color. These communities still have a lower enrollment rate for those eligible for Medicaid than other communities.   Maryland has experienced good improvement in access to healthcare since the ACA but must work to ensure these gains are not lost as a result of new leadership in Washington. This means prioritizing outreach and accessibility, incentivizing more small employers to provide good healthcare options, and ensuring reimbursement of services rendered by providers are competitive.","The state should look to support the city with sensible solutions that progress the city towards a safer streets and better management. The state should not impose regressive laws.   The legislature did well to create the commission to investigate the Gun Trace Task Force. We can not expect crime to decrease nor community/police trust to increase when the some of the enforcers are bad actors. Restoring integrity and faith in our police department is prerequisite to reducing crime.    However, the legislature failed by enhancing certain maximum sentences and mandatory minimums. We must continue the focus of removing violent repeat offenders from the streets, but we should not usurp the role of the judiciary in sentencing. These policies are regressive and do nothing to curtail violence in the city.   The legislature also failed to pass legislation to redistrict the police districts in Baltimore. This legislation passed the house unanimously but failed to get a hearing in the Senate. This is necessary for a better allocation of resources.   The legislature should support funding for community-based mediation and policing. The increased funding for Safe Streets will support this effort. Also, BPD's Community Collaboration Division does great work that should be supported and expanded.   We must restore programs like the Police Athletic League in Baltimore to create more opportunities for Police to engage with the community. This way officers can proactively develop relationships and thus reduce crime.    We must also assist the re-entry community in their reintegration into society to reduce recidivism.","Maryland's business climate is average and improving but not where it needs to be to combat Maryland's brand of not being business friendly. We must spur Baltimore's economic dynamism and the growth potential of the entire DMV.  We must invest in infrastructure projects to increase economic connectivity between the DC suburbs and the Baltimore metropolitan area.    We must raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour and keep the new minimum tied to the cost of living index.  A living wage increases consumer confidence and spending. It adds significant stability to families in Maryland.  It will have the effect of spurring the economy.   We can further enhance economic dynamism in the state by adjusting the corporate tax rate and the combined tax rate for pass through entities. The corporate tax rate is over 2% higher than VA. To counter the balance sheet impact of the absolutely necessary $15 per hour minimum wage, we can look at reducing the corporate tax rate to 7.5%. This will help businesses pay for the labor cost increase and attract new businesses to the state.   Small businesses provide most new net job growth and stabilize the economy. They must not be overburdened with taxes and costs. As such, we must reduce the combined tax rate for pass through entities. Most of these companies are small LLCs. They sometimes have a tax rate equal to the corporate rate. An excessive tax burden on small business dampens their ability to grow and kills jobs.",Absolutely.,"The Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights  does not adequately balance protections for police and the public. It unduly prohibits certain information from reaching judicial and administrative scrutiny.   If the law enforcement agency orders the law enforcement officer to submit to a test, examination, or interrogation, the results of the test, examination, or interrogation should be admissible and discoverable in a criminal proceeding against the law enforcement officer.  Officers should have 5 days (currently 10) to secure representation during an investigation. This right to representation is standard for all unionized public employees; police included, but should not be used to stall an investigation as it can end up destroying public trust.   Complainants of police misconduct should have 180 days, not 90 days, to submit their complaint.","I would follow the framework provided by Dr. Leana Wen, the Commissioner of Health for Baltimore City.  She outlines that Baltimore's focus is to: a. prevent deaths from overdose via expanding access to naloxone in certain hotspots in the city and expanding training on how to use naloxone to save lives, b. increase access to quality and effective on-demand treatment and provide long-term recovery support, and c.  increase education and awareness in order to reduce stigma and encourage prevention and treatment.  She outlines many details in her testimonial submission to the US House Oversight Committee  (see https://oversight.house.gov/hearing/combating-opioid-crisis/). I encourage everyone to read it.   Dr. Wen has also helped secure a $1 co-pay for naloxone through Medicaid. This is tremendous as it increases access to the life saving drug.   We must also increase education of the impact opioids can have on people, especially painkillers where people can form addiction unconsciously  while recovering from a trauma.   As someone who has dealt with the ramification of opioid addiction in my family, I believe Dr. Wen's approach to the crisis makes sense. We must treat addition like the disease it is. Criminalizing addiction has only broken families and destroyed communities.",The state should seek to spur investments in small and minority owned businesses. Small businesses are the economic engine of America. Most new net job growth occurs in the small business sector. Maryland should seek to incentivize entrepreneurs who start businesses in the tax code and with grants.  Increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour will dramatically increase income for many Marylanders. This will directly combat poverty by putting more money in people's pockets and will help businesses in Maryland grown due to increased consumer spending.   Access to job training opportunities for skills based workers enhances the workforce and increases the opportunity for individuals to sustain themselves. These training opportunities should also be made available for the re-entry community.,"Maryland laws can be strengthened to open more meetings to the public. There have been numerous instances of decision made behind closed doors and with processes that do not allow for the public to comment adequately. We should always embrace transparency, as it is always net positive in our democracy. Elected officials should champion transparent decision-making.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

I was a Higher Ed Administrator at Towson University for six years serving as the Director of Veterans Services. I currently offer consulting services to colleges, universities, and businesses related to Veteran recruitment, retention, and support services.","I do. The commission worked tirelessly to identify recommendations that would meet the needs of a 21st century public school system and I am impressed with the results. I am committed to funding suggested reforms and recommendations through the state, identifying federal programs and matching dollars, as well as potential public private partnerships. The findings of the commission will take time to implement and a timeline for funding over a number of years would be an appropriate fiscal strategy.","I believe there is an unbalanced focus on roads vs. public transit. Absolutely Maryland has the resources needed to meet its transportation needs. What is lacking is the leadership and political will to create a future minded transit plan that defines what our transit system should look like and what it will take to get there. No, current transit options do not adequately serve the Baltimore region.","Yes, I believe the legalization of marijuana would be a positive move for Maryland to take advantage of a potentially billion-dollar industry.",Recognizing our unique responsibility as stewards of the health and future of the Chesapeake Bay Maryland should continue its efforts to support a culture of accountability over the largest estuary in the nation. Empowering our local communities to take an active part in cleaning and defending the countless tributaries would be positive step to account for a diminished federal commitment. Holding industries accountable for proven negative impacts on the Chesapeake Bay should also be adopted. While we should continue to fight for adequate federal funding to maintain their commitment a knowledgeable and engaged public is the best defense to fluctuating federal commitments to the bay and our environment.,"This session we passed legislation to stabilize the insurance market and we need to work to ensure the success of the Affordable Care Act.  That said, I believe, the best solution would be a Medicare for all program.","While crime in Baltimore has been the focus of national attention, its impact is felt across the entire state. We need to address poverty, opportunity and good wages are the best way to combat violence.  We need to invest more in education.  And, we need to make sure that folks that commit violent acts are taken off the streets.","I would say that Maryland has always had a fundamentally friendly business climate. We continue to offer incentives to attract new businesses to set up shop here and have taken steps to keep them once they are here. This isn't new. I believe that businesses work best when they support their employees. For me this means providing an adequate wage, health care, and time off for families and parents. I think we foster the creation of family-supporting jobs by reinforcing that Maryland's values are represented by family-supporting jobs.",I believe gerrymandering is the biggest threat to democracy.  Study after study has shown that had districts been drawn fairly nation-wide democrats would hold a significant number of additional seats.,"As a Marine combat Veteran I understand the feeling of pride in choosing to serve others over oneself, but I also know that honor is doing what's right even when no one is watching. The Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights, as currently operating, seems to fall short of providing a system that holds the dishonorable to account while still supporting law enforcement professionals who truly protect and serve. Therefore I am in support of modest reforms. Police officers at their best are heroes plain and simple. Let's work together to restore the publics trust by fixing the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights so that hero cops can be heroes and transparency can hold dishonorable cops accountable.",I believe that shifting our approach to one that emphasizes treatment over incarceration is the key to solving the opioid crisis. Simply locking up those arrested for crimes related to opioids has proven to do nothing in curbing overdoses. Strategies must be implemented to treat this as a public health crisis rather than a criminal crisis.,"I believe that income inequality and wage stagnation will be looked at as the great challenge of our time. The past five decades have seen the cost of living dramatically increase, while wages have statistically remained stagnant compared to industry profits. Increasing the minimum wage is a catalyst in this fight. Strategically preparing and training our workforce to meet the needs of Maryland's diverse economy is another needed step. There are jobs available across Maryland that pay adequate and above average wages, but they require specialized skills that many seeking employment lack. We should make every effort to link our citizens to training and education that meets the demands of Maryland's 21st century economy.","I believe that Maryland's Public Information Act and open meetings laws provide the opportunity for Marylanders to exercise oversight of the government, however in practice it is not a simple, or timely, process. I believe improvements could be pursued to meet the needs of a 21st century electorate.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

In 1989 I took over management of our family farm, and in 2001 my husband and I opened a small manufacturing company. We continue to operate both the farm and the manufacturing company.","I strongly support the findings of the commission. Education is not only a fundamental civil rights issue, it also our best tool for negotiating a rapidly changing job market in which we face losing jobs to automation, and the creation of jobs we have not yet imagined.  We have always prided ourselves on having first rate schools in Maryland, but the commission found that in fact Maryland is in the middle of the pack in the US, which is in the middle of the pack in the world. We can and should be number one. Top notch schools are a powerful catalyst for broad based economic opportunity. I am committed to finding the necessary funding, through a lockbox on casino revenues which should all go to education, through making education the top priority in the budget, through greater accountability for school budgets to ensure that the funds reach the classroom, and eventually through the higher tax revenues generated by a better educated population. The GI bill returned almost $7 for every dollar we spent; a spectacular success story which we can repeat in Maryland with investment in pre-K, K-12, and adult education.","Baltimore traffic was recently ranked 36th in the nation. Not terrible, but not great either. Public transportation is always tough to fund. It's extremely expensive, there is the chicken and the egg problem of not enough riders to fund good reliable service and no way to get more riders until there is good, reliable service, and we are all just used to getting in our cars. Yet more and more people are looking for a car-free or nearly car-free lifestyle and driving up property values where that is possible. Public transportation that connects lower income neighborhoods with jobs and services is a huge factor in expanding economic opportunity. We should favor public transportation over roads in funding decisions wherever possible.","Currently nine states have legalized recreational marijuana, affording us an excellent opportunity to see how well it works, and I would like to wait for more data from those states.  There are numerous factors to consider, among them law enforcement, traffic accidents, drug abuse among adults and young people, as well as mass incarceration, in addition to the potential revenues.","We will need to step up our environmental efforts in Maryland as the federal government rolls back regulations and dismisses climate change. In terms of protections for the Chesapeake Bay, I support a ban on EPS  (expanded polystyrene)  food containers which are a major source of waterway pollution. There are good compostable and recyclable alternatives, and it's time we did away with this petroleum based source of litter and pollution. I also think we need more regulation of lawn chemicals. Farmers in Maryland are heavily regulated in terms of what they can put on their crops and when, but homeowners can throw anything they like on their lawns, the runoff from which ends up in the bay. I would like to see incentives created for small, best practices chicken farms to allow them to compete with the large scale factory farms which are a major source of pollution. Last but not least, we need a regional approach to nutrient and stormwater management, recognizing that runoff from our neighboring states flows into the bay without honoring state boundaries.","As a nation, we pay about twice what the average wealthy, developed nation pays for health care, and our outcomes are about 50th. We spend about 35% of our health care dollars on administrative costs, and most other wealthy, developed nations spend about 7%. We take a pill for everything, perhaps because we are one of two countries in the world that allow direct to consumer advertising of prescription drugs. Doctors are unhappy,  patients are unhappy, and for the first time ever our life expectancy is going down. Clearly it's time for change. I would support a system similar to Massachusetts's which has a state mandate for most residents to buy health insurance, and a state Health Connector which offers free or subsidized insurance  plans to residents who qualify, along with plans for people who don't work, are self-employed, or work part time or for more than one employer. In this gig economy, with employers finding myriad ways to avoid giving benefits to their workers, we must detach health insurance from employment. I support state funding for research into non-medical ways to keep people out of the hospital and emergency room, such as Johns Hopkins is doing with asthma. Health Affairs recently conducted a successful study in keeping vulnerable sick elderly and young disabled patients out of the ER by delivering nutritionally appropriate meals. These initiatives are part of a necessary shift in focus from disease to wellness.","We need both short term crime fighting initiatives and longer term solutions to address the underlying causes of violent crime, and one in no way should overshadow the other. We just saw the results of the NEAP scores for Baltimore, and learned that 13% of fourth and eight grade students are proficient or better in reading. Clearly this underlies the crime problem in Baltimore, but at the same time the crime problem makes learning more difficult for children who live in high crime neighborhoods. Experts agree that a high percentage of homicides and shootings in the city are committed by a relatively small number of violent repeat offenders. I applaud the recently passed legislation that imposes a 10 year mandatory minimum sentence for second offenses using a gun in a violent crime. I think state police assistance is certainly warranted.","Maryland's business climate has improved, but we still have a long way to go in creating jobs that really support families. Among the opportunities are clean energy jobs, including two major wind energy projects approved by the Public Service Commission, and infrastructure and transportation initiatives. The most powerful thing the state can do to support the creation of good jobs is to fully fund education and adopt the reforms suggested by the Kirwan Commission.","Gerrymandering is wrong, no matter which party engages in it, and every attempt to disenfranchise voters is a threat to our democracy, no matter the means. I absolutely support the creation of a non-partisan, independent body to draw congressional and legislative districts.  Given the complexity of the task, we need to ensure not only that the body is truly independent and non-partisan, but that the process is completely open and transparent.","The Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights is another case where openness and transparency are badly needed. I deeply respect the rights of law enforcement officers and appreciate the difficulty of their jobs, but the LEOBR, layered on top of union contracts, has resulted in years of payments to victims of excessive force without forcing any change in the department. The Gun Trace Task Force case and the Tavon White case at the Baltimore City Detention Facility should make this clear. It will be impossible to improve community/police relations, and therefore to lower violent crime in Baltimore without changes that give residents a stronger voice and create a more open disciplinary process. Both the majority of good law enforcement officers and Baltimore residents deserve no less.","In order to create the political will necessary to find the funds we need to fight the opioid crisis, I would like to fund a study to put a dollar figure on its consequences. We need a multi-pronged approach, from simple and relatively inexpensive measures like 24/7 drug disposal sites to keep opioids out of the water supply and the wrong hands, to ones much more difficult to achieve, like creating real economic opportunity in places where it doesn't exist. I would like to see public education campaigns focused on addiction as a disease, and on relieving  the stigma that can get in the way of treatment. We need enough treatment beds so that every addict revived from an overdose can be offered one right then and there. We need easily accessible and free or reduced cost treatment for anyone who wants it. We need training for first responders in the use of naloxone. We need community mobilization events that put information and resources where they are needed. Numerous counties and localities have filed suit against the distributors of opioids, who knowingly shipped them thousands of times more opioid doses than there are residents, overwhelming law enforcement and social services. I pray those suits are successful: distributors must be held accountable.",".  Universal pre-K would help to bridge the wide vocabulary gap between children from non-English speaking and lower income families and those from more advantaged families. Education is fundamental to addressing income inequality and the effort needs to begin at the pre-K level and continue through 12th grade with a fully funded and accountable education system committed to providing equal opportunities for every child. The state should support our unions and their efforts to create family supporting jobs, as well as the apprenticeship programs they offer. We should outlaw the practice of changing employees schedules and hours without notice, and we should make a much more serious effort to increase the availability of affordable housing. Like several other states, the Maryland legislature created a consumer financial protection commission to fill the gap now that Trump has defunded the CPFB. We will have to count on them to stop the still rampant racism and discrimination in mortgage lending that keeps many people of color from owning homes. Current levels of income inequality are an insidious disease that eats away not only at our democracy, but at our economy, and the state should do everything it can to overcome it.","Maryland's Public Information Act and open meetings laws seem reasonable enough to me, but they certainly do not ensure our oversight of government, as the Nathaniel Oaks case clearly illustrates. From outright public corruption to business as usual lobbying, it's hard not feel as though special interests and well-connected companies own our government. Campaign finance reform would be a more effective path to change than an expansion of the PIA and open meeting laws.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?

I previously worked in the Office of Child and Youth Protection at the Archdiocese of Baltimore for Cardinal William H. Keeler, as well as in a government relations firm and on Congressional races.","I support the majority of the findings in the Kirwin Commission report.  The report states that despite better investments in Universal Pre-K, Maryland's Pre-K programs are viewed as ""average"" in the United States. We must do a better job to increase Universal Pre-K access regardless of socio-economic background or zip code; doing so will close further close the achievement gap. The report also encourages better protections for at-risk students, including students from diverse communities.  Whether referencing smaller student-teacher ratios, career and college ready services, anti-bullying measures and increased mental health access, the answer always comes down to funding to build better schools. I am committed to funding the recommended reforms in the report through increased contributions from our casinos.  Our state must increase pressure on casinos to produce the intended revenue for our public school system. If elected, I will fight to make sure this happens.","No.  Maryland must do better to connect communities across the state and relieve traffic congestion through new transit initiatives. Reducing our carbon footprint to fight climate change should always be a central focus, so building new roads should be the alternative only when new transit options are much more expensive or not compatible with exisiting transportation needs and geographic areas. Our state does not have the resources to meet existing needs, which include funding WMATA and other transit projects. Finally, Baltimore is grossly underserved by transit. Better connections are needed to get around the city and for families to travel to and from Annapolis, DC, and elsewhere in Maryland.  This is why we need a new source of revenue for transit projects.","Yes. Over 60% of Marylanders support the legalization of marijuana. Legalizing recreational marijuana will lessen the stigma placed on patients who want to utilize marijuana for medical reasons, but hesitate to request a prescription. Legalizing recreational marijuana will also significantly boost our local economies, regardless if you consume it, and will further reduce crime.  Legalization should place marijuana under government control and allow for organized labor to participate in the process in order to strengthen the influence of our unions.  If elected, I will support legalization measures in order to create a state transportation fund so Maryland better funds Metro, Bus Rapid Transit, Baltimore's transit initiatives, as well as explores options for increased transit services between Annapolis and our nation's capital. Legalization funds can also contribute to our state's education budget to better fund school construction.","Maryland can implement a number of programs to protect our Bay.   These programs include fighting the Trump administration's efforts to damage our Eastern Shore, educating and partnering with our farmers to reduce pollution and create a green job market surrounding new energy sources and climate resilience.  Climate change and green energy are perhaps two of the most important issues our state can tackle to fend off Trump's catastrophic policies eroding our bay and threatening Maryland tourism.  Unlike our federal government, we must strengthen state resources for our environmental agencies, build coalitions with local organizations, and educate our families on how to join the fight to protect our Bay.","Maryland should strive to achieve a single-payer health care system. Until that day comes, our state should focus on implementing the same benefits offered in the Affordable Care Act, implement paid sick leave standards for working families, and increase mental health services.  We should invest in the educational and cultural resources, both online and in community forums, that make it possible for as many Marylanders to enroll in these programs as possible.  Creating better access to health care improves the well being of our students, unions, small businesses, faith-based communities, immigration population, and our seniors.  Increasing access to health care programs may also decrease the number of deaths from opioid use, enable students to perform better in our schools, and offer better services for seniors and other vulnerable populations, including underserved communities.","I lived in Baltimore City for two years. During that time, my friends and I survived a home invasion in Fells Point and were held at gunpoint for over two hours until we escaped. I understand the need for stricter gun control laws in Maryland and will build coalitions across the state to achieve reform.  In addition to stricter gun laws, we need increased mental health services, more resources for the Baltimore City Police Department, and better investments in community watch groups. Our state should also coordinate efforts with the Mayor and Council to provide better funding for educational and social programs for our youth and discourage criminal activity. These initiatives are part of my Social & Economic Justice and Cultural Awareness priorities.","Maryland can do a better job attracting new business around the state.  Doing a better job means directing development efforts to areas in actual need of development in order to boost local economies. Targetted development helps protect our environment and accomplishes Social & Economic Justice. Our business climate should also incorporate Cultural Awareness programs to better include our immigrant and diverse populations so they have a better seat at the economic table. One way to accomplish this is through greater participation for women and minorities in our state's Minority Business Enterprise program. Supporting new and innovative transit projects in our neighborhoods also increases the likelihood of a thriving economy.  If elected, I will empower small businesses and aspiring entrepreneurs from all backgrounds, fight to retain and attract new business in Maryland, and help create a green jobs economy to implement climate resilience programs and reduce our carbon footprint. We must be creative in this process. When our economy pushes down on our citizens, we must empower them to push back three times harder.","Yes.  An independent commission will better serve the voters in our state and preserve our democracy.  I am running for office to change the way government works for all citizens across the state. I will support the creation of a non-partisan, independent body if elected.","The Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights (LEOBOR) provides a good foundation for protecting the police and the public, but improvements are necessary.  For example, the issue of adding a civilian representative to police review boards was addressed late in the 2018 legislative session.  I support this measure because it will change the LEOBOR to better address community needs. However, this process should consider bargaining agreements, including the opinions of law enforcement officers, and provide proper training standards for a citizen who will serve on the board. I also support extending the LEOBOR application to college campuses desiring to incorporate better due process standards for university police.","Maryland is failing to provide residents with adequate mental health and wellness programs.  We need better health insurance options so individuals struggling with addiction can access the services they need to recover.  We also need wellness programs and mental health education in our public school systems so younger generations learn that opioids and other drugs are not alternatives to counseling.   These programs should be available to all communities, especially minorities and lower income families.  I was appointed by the Montgomery County Government to serve as Legal Representative for the County's Mental Health Association. Previously, I served on the Montgomery County Children's Panel to champion affordable housing options for foster youth entering adulthood. These experiences made me realize how few resources our county and state have available for residents in need of them.  If we are to overcome the opioid crisis, we can only succeed if mental health programs become a better priority.  Our efforts with the Keep the Door Open Act are a good start.","Maryland should adopt a $15 dollar minimum wage and also increase wages for tipped workers.  We should invest in our small business community, provide training for local entrepreneurs to jump-start small businesses, and increase participation in the Minority Business Enterprise program, which should include LGBT owned businesses.  In order to make sure students are career and college ready, I support free community college tuition, state-sponsored student loan relief programs, apprenticeship labor opportunities, and technical courses offered to prepare future generations for multiple career paths.  Cultural Awareness programs are also helpful because they allow future business owners of diverse backgrounds to access government services and tax breaks to jump-start a business. Income inequality can also be addressed by investing in better transit options for working families to get to and from work.  Finally, we should better invest in environmental protection initiatives and create a ""green jobs"" market to increase our workforce and achieve environmental justice.  My campaign's top three priorities are Social & Economic Justice, Cultural Awareness, and the Environment.  Supporting the above policies and programs will enable these priorities to become a reality.","Attorney General Brian Frosh's December 2017 report on the implementation of the Private Information Act provides recommendations for better government oversight for citizens.  State residents should have adequate, accurate, and consistent oversight of government activity, which includes the Open Meetings Act.  Maryland's Open Meetings Compliance Board recently discovered violations made by the Worcester County Board of Education and the Carroll County Board of Commissioners due to lack of adequate closed-door meeting notices and the failure to provide post closed-door meeting summaries.  Our boards should continue to identify these errors and improve our cooperation with local governments to achieve proper oversight.  We must balance public access to public records with privacy rights of individuals and organizations while protecting government interests.  These laws adequately ensure Marylanders' ability to exercise oversight and we must continue to implement these recommendations so that oversight improves over time.","Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education?
