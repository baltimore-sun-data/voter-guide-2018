I will answer what I think the Glassman administrations greatest accomplishment for my community has been in my own opinion.  A carved wooden mariner statue.  Although year 4 is not over yet .  Greatest failings are waiting until an election year to give county employee raises and not giving enough funding for addiction recovery , changing the charter to give yourself too much authority over county employees, accepting charter changes that were self serving to your own administration, wasting time changing the color of the rim of the county seal to match your campaign colors, not doing anything to ensure women could get the same addiction recovery treatment made available to men at the detention center. The rate increase in our water bill. Would have been great to have had some type of plan for consideration of seniors on fixed incomes and those living and struggling to pay bills to take care of their families.","I would like Harford County Council and administration to work side by side with the Board of Education to put a plan in place to ensure the children of our county equality in  educational opportnities. The same with law enforcement. Creating a partnership to discuss, resolve and put in place solutions. I would work towards not having to answer a question of adequate resources for  two of our most important resources our children and law enforcement/first responders.",No.,I am a resident that sees the numbers every month from the Hope Board.   I have ideas from  research of other communities efforts. I would like to see a bigger investment from the budget. A center opened now in a  building to serve as an addiction recovery center for those that have no where else to turn.  Have workers that provide home check ups and are there to walk patients through every day struggles. Offer incentives to children at risk in school to hopefully get them on the right path for success. Offer incenitves to businesses to mentor those recovering who are able to go out and be productive and learn a trade.  I would work with the community because communication is everything.,I think the Harford County Sheriff's Office goes above and beyond what their duties call for.  If any reforms are necessary that should come from within.,I was under the impression from the county that we purchased 2 ambulances and hired employees at no extra cost to the county. That all of this was to assist the current EMS system. Whatever is truly going on needs to be addressed. Being deceitful  is not an option I would choose.,What do you consider the greatest accomplishments and failings of the Glassman administration?,"Does Harford County have adequate resources to meet its needs, particularly in the funding of public schools and law enforcement?",Have the county's land use policies adequately balanced growth and the preservation of existing communities and agricultural land?,"How do you rate the county's efforts to fight opioid addiction overdoses?

,YES,harford-county/county-executive,Barry Glassman,Glassman,3/24/1962,Darlington,Republican,"Graduated Harford County Public Schools Washington College, Bachelor of Arts - Political Science","Retired Claims Specialist, Baltimore Gas and Electric Company; Former County Councilman, State Delegate, State Senator,  current 2nd VP of Maryland Association of Counties and part-time sheep farmer.",http://www.barryglassman.com,BarryGlassmanforMaryland,harfordexec,http://surveygizmoresponseuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/fileuploads/296249/4299906/253-91217cc7ec1c4fc18e925c9d38c3d823_Barry_Glassman.jpg,"I am pleased that my fiscal plan for the County has been our biggest accomplishment.  When I came into office three and a half years ago the County's debt load had tripled, the fund balance had been drawn down to less than $7 million dollars and teachers, deputies and county workers had not received raises for as many as 6 years.  Through our efficiency efforts and economic development, we have reversed that and this year our fund balance is back to $18 million dollars, debt load increase has been leveled, and 90% of our new revenue went to restoration of pay scales for our public employees.  We have maintained our AAA bond rating, funded our OPEB obligations at 100% and adopted the county's first 20% property tax credit for senior citizens and retired military. One area I have not been satisfied with is our efforts to transfer technology jobs from Aberdeen Proving Ground to outside the gate into the private sector.  This is partly due to Congress' failure to pass a budget, however; due to the recent federal budget action and funding for this type transfer, I have already received a letter of intent from the National Center for Manufacturing Sciences center for a location outside the gate in Harford County.  I hope to announce this additive manufacturing initiative prior this fall thus reaching this still outstanding goal.","Yes, we can meet our needs without raising taxes by operating efficiently and sequencing large capital projects. In fact, I am proud that we have budgeted $24 million over the past three years to restore salaries each year for our teachers, law enforcement and dedicated county employees, without increasing tax rates.  After a pause to get the county's debt down to more responsible levels, we are also about to break ground on a planned modernization of Havre de Grace Middle/High School. However, we are seeking our fair share of resources from the state. For example, we provided an additional $15 million in operating funding to our public schools over the last three years, while state funding increased by only $1 million. So we are advocating for changes to the state funding formulas that tend to underfund rural/suburban counties. Lastly, as vice-president of the Maryland Association of Counties, I am pleased that we successfully lobbied my former colleagues in the Maryland General Assembly for additional Highway User Revenue to fix local roads. The state collects this revenue and returns a portion to the counties. But under the prior state administration, the local  share was cut to balance the state budget. Harford County will combine this new revenue with the $16 million in county funding already dedicated during my administration to repair and maintain local roads. I have been endorsed by Harford County's Teachers, Deputies and Correctional Officers.","To achieve this balance for a better quality of life, we are encouraging higher quality development projects while expanding our agricultural preservation programs. For example, we created a mixed-use Magnolia Overlay District with increased county oversight of project design, and my upcoming budget will set a record of $22 million for agricultural preservation. This is in addition to our plan to reduce the pressure to expand the development envelope in the Churchville/Creswell area with incentives to preserve adjacent agricultural land. This area is also the subject of an upcoming study to help ensure that future growth is well coordinated and supported by infrastructure.  Countywide, we recently completed HarfordNEXT, our county master plan, and a required comprehensive zoning review. Throughout these processes, we used technology to promote transparency and encourage citizen engagement. In fact, our Comprehensive Zoning Review Tracker won a national award for innovation from the National Association of Counties. HarfordNEXT is now in the implementation phase, which includes the county's first green infrastructure plan. Citizens can follow these implementations on the county website at www.harfordcountymd.gov.","With our location on the I-95 corridor, Harford County has been hit hard by the opioid epidemic and the deadly additives fentanyl and carfentanil. Nationwide, many people who became addicted are still suffering. In part, this is because opioids rewire the brain in ways that make recovery very difficult, but not impossible.  Locally, we're seeing signs of progress in prevention, especially among our youth, and we have been working to raise awareness and fund treatment. I began by calling out this public health crisis in my December 2014 inaugural address.  Since then we have developed a multi-faceted approach that won a national award. Our efforts include training for 90 peer recovery coaches; Project Healthy Delivery to help pregnant women stay in treatment; community forums including the former U.S. surgeon general; the original play ""Addicted""; our Night of Conversation reaching more than 70,000 families in 2017, and public service announcements featuring local youth. We show these PSAs in local movie theaters because research indicates that peer to peer messaging is effective. In all, our media campaign including billboards has received over 4.3 million impressions. To help fund these efforts, my first budget included the first-ever county funding for treatment and prevention starting at $200K and rising to $250K annually, which has been leveraged to over $1 million by my outstanding team in Community Services and our Office of Drug Control Policy. We will continue to help those who are afflicted and their families to break free of this terrible disease.","In Harford County, the voters elect the sheriff and the sheriff's office is not under the control of county government. However, my administration has worked closely with local law enforcement, most recently on our plan to have a school resource officer assigned in all of our public middle schools, in addition to our existing program in all county high schools.","I understood that there would be challenges, having grown up in the volunteer fire service – I was an EMT with the Level VFC and a member of the MSFA Hall of Fame.  But as county executive, I am responsible for ensuring that we maintain high quality emergency care, even as public demand rises and volunteerism declines in the face of increased training requirements. We first engaged the University of Maryland Center for Health and Homeland Security for a study to involve stakeholders and provide a neutral analysis of current practices and future needs. We then moved into the first phase of implementation. Rather than rush in, we are proceeding methodically to help us gain experience and make necessary adjustments. We hired a dedicated medical director to oversee patient care and then we staffed the first county-owned ""surge"" ambulance that began operations in January. This team of paramedics is available 24/7 countywide to meet surges in demand, and complements services now provided by volunteer fire companies and the Harford County Fire and EMS Foundation. Helping to guide the process is my EMS Standards Advisory Board. I appointed this volunteer board of subject-matter experts, including a representative from the volunteer services, which meets publicly and reports to my director of Emergency Services.  I am satisfied with our progress so far, although there will always be growing pains. I try to focus on our ultimate goal of upholding Harford County's tradition of delivering high quality care when our citizens need us most.",What do you consider the greatest accomplishments and failings of the Glassman administration?,"Does Harford County have adequate resources to meet its needs, particularly in the funding of public schools and law enforcement?",Have the county's land use policies adequately balanced growth and the preservation of existing communities and agricultural land?,"How do you rate the county's efforts to fight opioid addiction overdoses?
