I respect County Executive Kamenetz for serving Baltimore County. The county executive added more funding for a consecutive amount of years to the County school budget to rebuild and renovate schools .  Some of the failings have been the attempted sale of school property to a retail developer. The resulting attempted sale relocated a police department and threatened to pave over a large recreational space. The community fought back against it and sale was halted by the state . The executive seemed to lose touch with some less affluent communities in the county with some of the administration's actions .","The adopted operating budget support detail fiscal year 2018 for Baltimore County Department of Education category of LAND, BLDG, and OTHER IMPROVEMENTS indicates the adjusted appropriated budget for FY2017 is 14,484,815 and adopted budget for FY2018 is 14,595,311. Based on the budgetary information FY2018 budget currently indicates adequate resources to meet its needs particularly to renovate or replace aging schools. In the event more funds would be required to satisfy commitments then a current spending audit and budgetary funds surplus in other agencies would be considered. Burdening the citizens of Baltimore County with Increasing property tax or local income tax should be the avoided and only should be considered after all the other resources are exhausted.",There should be no discrimination against anyone using federal programs.,Yes the county exercises adequate oversight of the school system.,The Revitalization of an aging community could lead to growth and increased tax revenue when communities start growing again . Any help to communities that are undergoing revitalization would have to be deemed on a case by case basis and the positive impacts to the community and county would have to be weighed in the decision making process .,Baltimore County Police must conduct more public outreach programs to increase visibility and to further continue to build trust within the community they serve. Reforms are method of continuous improvement and reforms that supports the community and improved quality of work for Baltimore County Police Department must be adopted.,We must continue the preservation of our rural land in Baltimore County. Current Urban-Rural Demarcation Line is servicing the county's needs. Zoning policies must be stringent to continue supporting of the rural land preservation in Baltimore County.,Historically within Baltimore County works in collaboration with cultural institutions and non-profits and have encouraged high quality artistic programs for the residents of the county. Baltimore County must continue to strengthen their outreach within the county. Initiations of support for cultural institutions in Baltimore city must be addressed only if Baltimore County's budget can support the project. A collaborative approach is always considered between both the Baltimore City and County community for cultural institutions.,Maryland Transit Authority have been serving the residents of Baltimore Community with great stride. Unfortunately many areas of Baltimore County are still deprived of public transportation.

We would need to see if misappropriation of funds allocated for schools has been an issue. Otherwise, schools that have been on the list to receive renovations such as Dulaney and Landsdowne, should of received them. All schools should have been air-conditioning, as planned. There are definit concerns as to the upkeep and condition of schools.  There has been outsourcing of services by this administration, where those funds have been much needed here within the County.  I think there should be a full accessment of the budget and spending, before taxes are increased. It seems like There are definet discrepancies between various communities East to West, and the care of their communities and roadways, and infrastructure.  Certain County employees pensions and retirement plans are increased, yet schools and roadways are deficient.

There are a lot of discipline issues in our school buildings. There are too many disruptions in over-crowded schools. School Resource Officers are not allowed to do their jobs in the schools. Students are afraid, as well as teachers, bus drivers, school support staff. The school system needs more involvement by the County, working together, in order to get schools up to standards both with discipline and education.","The County could meet with the various communities, help access needs and wants of the citizens, as well as community organizations. Together create a plan, and Review the cost of implementation of the plan. Determine funding availability and other resources that could help fund the plans.","I think there are strained relationships in some communities between BC Police and the community. It is worse in some communities, over others. There needs to be a plan created to have a greater police presence and interaction with citizens of all ages.

During this time, taxes were not raised and Baltimore County maintained it's Triple AAA Bond Rating. The biggest failing of the Kamenetz administration is that he left the impression, fair or unfair that he is disinterested in Eastern Baltimore County and the opinion of it's residents.","Yes Baltimore County has adequate resources to meet it's needs, particularity to renovate and replace aging schools. In my district, the sixth council district, all schools have central air-conditioning, there have been major renovations to both Parkville and Overlea High Schools, and three new schools are being constructed in the sixth district alone.",This is a tough issue. I voted against the Home Act in 2016 because there is already a disproportionate amount of affordable housing in the sixth district. I do not support polices that force a disproportionate amount of housing vouchers in the sixth district.,"The county government exercises adequate oversight over the school system by approving the budget for Baltimore County Public Schools, which encompasses 52% of the entire Baltimore County Budget. The Council has gone beyond its formal role with the school system by requesting that the State of Maryland conduct an independent audit of the Board of Education and its purchasing practices.",The county has a number of tools at it's disposal to assist in the preservation and revitalization of aging communities. The county offers tax credits and conditional loans to attract and maintain businesses that provide jobs and a tax base for communities. The county also has several Commercial Revitalization Districts that makes it easier for communities and businesses to receive grant funding and low interest loans among other things. Revitalizing our older business districts is critical to healthy communities.,No relationship is perfect but overall the relationship between the Baltimore County Police and the communities is strong. Each of the twelve county police precincts have Police Community Relation Council for community outreach. Baltimore County has a strong Citizens on Patrol (COP) program. Also the county has adopted the police body camera program which will increase transparency.,"The zoning polices have done a lot of good to serve the county's needs by attracting new businesses and expanding the county's tax base. However for the zoning polices to better serve the needs of residents, they should be updated to include 21st century industries. I also believe it is time to explore ways to ensure developers provide more to communities that result in healthy vibrant neighborhoods.","Baltimore County's support of cultural institutions in Baltimore City such as the National Aquarium, the Science Center, and the Walter's Art Museum is just right because county residents and students visit these institutions. Vibrant cultural offerings are a key component to a healthy regional economy.",There is still work to be done to ensure the county is adequately served by mass transit.

He has managed to keep Baltimore Counties AAA bond rating and has been able to balance the counties budget each year. However, the next council will inherit some real problems from the last 8 years. The Spending Affordability Committee recently issued its annual report indicating that the county is in danger of falling short of its ability to pay its debt and set aside required savings each year. His proposal for free community college for recent high school graduates is welcome but does not go far enough. The decision to pay for a new Dulaney High School is likely the right one, though the plan for paying for it is not adequate, and the Towson Gateway project exemplifies pay-to play politics in the county.","Baltimore County government has done a remarkable job over the last quarter century of providing services for its residents while holding its tax rate steady. Indeed over the last 18 years, Baltimore County has attracted 75,000 more residents and has not had to raise its property nor income tax rates. Those rates have stayed where they are for the last 29 years. However, we are beginning to see strains where affordability is becoming a real issue. Pension and health care costs for the county continue to grow, many of our schools are crumbling and are in need of replacement, and our transportation infrastructure needs to be upgraded for the 21st century. If we want to continue to provide the opportunity and quality of life that Baltimore County can rightly be proud of, it would be negligent to not look at a range of revenue increases from impact fees from developers to examining tax rates.","I do support the federal housing consent decree and will push for passage of the HOME act. There is an affordable housing crisis in Baltimore County. The current wait time for housing with a voucher in the county is nine years. Contrary to some common beliefs, these housing vouchers are used by people who are senior citizens 32%, people with disabilities 30%, and low wage workers 25%. The HOME act simply eliminates a form of discrimination that prevents landlords from discriminating against applicants on the basis of their source of income. Landlords may still decline to rent to individuals with criminal histories, poor credit ratings or any other criteria that is not prohibited by law. This is not an experiment that Baltimore County is trying; similar laws exist in Howard and Montgomery counties. By outlawing discrimination against voucher holders, Baltimore County can work towards eliminating the pockets of poverty plaguing many areas of the county. Research also shows that academic success is closely linked to economic opportunity. Passage of The HOME Act will significantly increase the likelihood that a family with a Housing Choice Voucher will be able to move to a high opportunity area and put their child in a good school thus beginning to break some of the bonds of poverty that hold back some from a brighter future.",The Baltimore County School Board should make sure that it conducts its business in a transparent and ethical manner. The recent lapses by the leadership of Baltimore County Schools demonstrate negligence in regard to ethical rules that must end. Similar problems with financial disclosers and procurement practices show that only with audit oversight by the Baltimore County Government can we ensure that the board is operating in the best interests of all of its stakeholders.,"The Baltimore County government should be an advocate for its existing neighborhoods and should work hard to make sure they are as livable as any new development. Many of our older communities have much to offer. They are already served by public water and sewer, roads, public transportation, and schools, and all have a valuable community history. The county should build and increase community based capacity to acquire and rehabilitate existing stock. They should promote the use of modern sustainable and green design in all the rehabilitative plans. We should also provide assistance so that first time and low and moderate income homebuyers may purchase existing homes in our community conservation areas.","Baltimore County police have worked hard to be responsive and professional in their duty to serve and protect the public. Maintaining good relations with the community is crucial to ensuring harmony between the police and the communities they serve. Recent reforms requiring all officers to wear body cameras, and increased training to equip officers with strategies to deal with people who may have mental health issues are welcome. Another positive step is the agreement with the Maryland Coalition against Sexual Assault to review the way county police respond to sexual assaults. Efforts to build trust between the police and the people of Baltimore county must be ongoing to maintain what has been generally good relations.","Baltimore County's planning decision in 1967 to create the Urban Rural Demarcation Line has been one of the wisest and most far reaching municipal designing decisions ever reached. The county voluntarily decided to keep two thirds of its area rural and direct urban development in the remaining areas. Despite growing pressures on the rural side of the line for increased development that original vision is still a model we should follow. Its success will be guided by cooperation with local communities, like the Valleys Planning Council who were instrumental in developing the line, and working hard to revitalize the existing commercial corridors and focus urban development in the places originally envisioned. Baltimore County is a special place to live because of how well these two seemingly contradictory areas coexist. This must be preserved. Residents enjoy the beauty of the countryside while remaining close to urban conveniences.","Baltimore County is blessed by proximity to the cultural life of Baltimore City. Last year over 70,0000 county residents visited the city to enjoy Orioles, Raven and Blast games, they attended the BSO and saw shows at Center Stage, the Hippodrome and dozens of smaller theaters, they attended openings and exhibitions at the BMA, the Walters, and Visionary Art Museum among literally dozens of other culturally rich venues. Over the last eight years, Baltimore County has awarded $26 million dollars in grants to art and cultural institutions in both the city and county. Baltimore County is richer for its association with the vibrant cultural life of the city and the county should continue to ensure that those opportunities continue to exist and thrive for generations to come.","Baltimore County is not adequately served by our existing mass transit system. The County growing rapidly and needs a variety of strategies to move citizens to their places of work and recreation. Our current transportation network has not grown and adapted with the pace and direction of development to both grow our economy and to protect the environment. Baltimore County transportation is a hodgepodge of incomplete plans from the subway connecting Owings Mills to Johns Hopkins to the light rail linking Hunt Valley to BWI. Both systems were designed as the first leg of more extensive networks that were never completed. The loss of the Red Line project on the east and west side of Baltimore County cost us a significant investment in moving beyond a car-centric system, and valuable time in beginning to move toward a transportation system that is more than the addition of lanes to the beltway. Real vision and committed work will be required to bring our fractured transportation network up to the standards of other metro areas like Cleveland, St. Louis, Seattle and Denver. We know that regions that invest in transportation will attract new residents and give existing residents more reason to stay.

The free ride for Baltimore County Developers must come to an end. We already ask for Developers to assist with infrastructure improvements required for their new homes such as Sewer Connections, but the Tax payers of Baltimore County are unfairly handed the bill to build new schools. This is why I will be asking Developers to share the costs of building new schools just like almost every other County in the State already demands.","It was Parkville's Loch Raven Village Resident, Republican County Executive S.

Baltimore County is dangerously close to maxing out the bonds, thereby leaving the next administration to deal with tough choices that could impact our ability to continue to borrow at low interest rates.","Currently, Baltimore County does not have the resources to renovate or rebuild aging schools. The current administration has promised to rebuild Dulaney High School, but the County Council has already stated it will not approve this project due to the county's improper spending.

If elected, I will work with the other council members to sure up a 10 year plan for new construction and renovations of our aging schools, as well as a preventative maintenance plan, so we can extend the life of our existing schools.","I do not support Baltimore County's federal housing consent decree. By doing this, it removed any legal action that could be taken by our own judges. The citizens of Baltimore County that own rental homes have no one to help and support them when legal decisions are handed down. I believe in growing our economy so less people need federal housing vouchers by earning competitive salaries in the work place.","No, especially in light of the issues we are now faced with because of Dr. Dance, it is clear that we need more accountability in our school system.","In certain areas of the county where preserving an aging community is warranted, the county can classify the area or community as ""Historic"".

We have been extremely aggressive with school construction and renovations, $1.7 Billion spent over the past seven years. Maryland owes Baltimore County approximately $230 Million, for school construction, yet pays us $30-$40 Million a year. I could not support a tax increase except for certain situations, I.E. if the citizens ask for it, by demanding items that require a significant increase in revenue and there was no other way to raise the additional revenue (Fees), or the only alternative to a tax increase is a major reduction in needed services to the citizens and or large scale layoffs of employees. I am committed to doing my duty, to provide the necessary services to the citizens of Baltimore County. I would never say I would never raise taxes.","Yes. and I voted yes for the source of income legislation. I oppose discrimination in all forms. In addition to section 8, the disabled and veterans also receive federal housing vouchers. So they too suffer discrimination when people refuse to accept a voucher without interviewing the person and learning their circumstance. The idea behind razing high rise public housing was to eliminate the concentration of poverty. It was a good idea, but what has happened because of discrimination by not accepting vouchers, we are seeing these pockets of discrimination appear in the east and west sides of Baltimore County. Of the 5,600 vouchers n Baltimore County, most are in Essex, Dundalk, Woodlawn and Randallstown. Owners of apartment complexes will accept vouchers in certain areas and not accept them in others.","Yes, as much as possible. The county has very little if any oversight of the school system. Whether we should have more is debatable. There are good reasons why we have the system we have in Maryland. Baltimore County government has a good partnership and working relationship with the superintendent and the board of education.

Failures – The County Executive failed to reach out to Baltimore county citizens for input regarding County projects and policies. Unhealthy relationships that his administration has had with special interests have also resulted in the County spending to benefit a few well connected individuals and companies. He has also ignored the acute need for recreational facilities in Baltimore County. Lastly, the County Executive has also adopted certain policies that are in direct conflict with Federal immigration policies, leading many to conclude that Baltimore County is a sanctuary county, including me.","I oppose any and all tax increases, whether it be property taxes or income taxes. I do believe that we have the resources and means to afford the necessary replacement and renovation of public schools. It is simply a matter of priorities. Unfortunately, the current Administration has approved expenditures which benefit special interests and political cronies. The $43 million bailout to well-connected developers at Towson Row, funded by raiding future tax revenues, is a perfect example. Furthermore, recently the Baltimore County Board of Education approved funding totaling $140 million over seven years to continue the County's STAT tablet program. There has yet to be an adequate evaluation regarding the academic success of this program. The contract is with the same company that won a no bid contract (over $200 million) under now convicted former Superintendent Dallas Dance. Under the current STAT contract, despite all the money spent by County taxpayers, all tablets currently in use must be returned to the vendor! Some of this lost revenue could be used for debt service in order to fund needed school construction and renovation. We do not need tax increases to ensure the necessary public services.","I do not view the Consent Agreement as positive step for Baltimore County residents and I oppose forcing landlords to accept section 8 vouchers. The agreement is simply another step by the Federal Government's fixation with social engineering, which poses a direct threat to a way of life that you and I and many others have worked to attain and maintain. This is the American Dream. The Agreement in which Baltimore County has entered into threatens it. Most of us were raised to achieve certain goals. Those goals included getting a good education, a job and advancing up the ladder of success. It is unacceptable that so many are trapped in failing schools and poor neighborhoods. I know that their chances of realizing the American Dream are compromised. No one person has all the answers, but I do question how, with all the money we spend on education, does the situation remain so deplorable in some of our schools? In a few areas of the County, there is an absence of community involvement working to facilitate good relations between the schools, police, social workers and residents. Thankfully the Third District is blessed with strong and closely knit communities which support one another.","Due to state law, the County has very little oversight power concerning the public school system. The County cannot order an audit of the School system nor can it dictate spending priorities. That power rests with the School Board. The County Council only has the power to cut the school budget. However, if the budget is cut, only the school board has the power to set spending priorities with the money that has been appropriated. I firmly believe that this relationship is in need of changing, especially in light of recent convictions of high level officials in the Baltimore County school system. In order to give the county more authority to monitor the adherence to fiscal policies, the state law will need to be changed. This way, the County Council and Administration will be able to ensure that receipts and disbursements are handled appropriately and ethically. In my opinion, this needs to be a priority in the upcoming term.","Redevelopment of our aging communities and revitalization of formerly vibrant industrial centers should be a strong county priority. Encouragement of development where adequate public facilities exist is smart as well as preferable. I am a strong supporter of smart growth, but I do not support developing every square inch of open land in established communities, which is why I preserved over a thousand acres of green and open space in these communities during the last zoning cycle. Other subdivisions have addressed this issue by offering property tax credits over a finite period, offering assistance with settlement costs, or offering property owners loans to seniors which are then repaid with interest upon the sale of the home. Improvements to infrastructure are also catalytic in revitalizing areas in need. I am a firm believer in seeing what is successful in other jurisdictions and implementing similar policies.","Because of the vibrant community outreach programs such as the Police Community Relations Council, the people of the Third District have an excellent relationship with Baltimore County Police. This past winter, there were a number of high profile break-ins in the central area of the County. The police developed a strategy to quickly catch the perpetrators while keeping the public informed. With the implementation of body cameras, Baltimore County has taken a significant step forward in ensuring that the rights of both police and civilians are protected.","I am a firm believer in the Master Plan and the preservation of the Urban Rural Demarcation Line. Asides from protecting property rights, these two factors were essential to my decision making during the 2016 Comprehensive Zoning Map Process. Baltimore County has been successful in preserving over 65,000 acres of agricultural land, forests and open space. Preservation of our prime and productive agricultural land is imperative to ensure that the farming industry, which is a large part of the County's economy, remains viable and continues to thrive. It is also important to note that one million central Maryland citizens rely on public water from the three reservoirs in Baltimore County. In order to protect the quality of the drinking water, the URDL and Master Plan calls for significant limitations on development. Zoning decisions outside the URDL must reflect the importance of these issues. During the 2016 CZMP, I preserved nearly 1,500 acres in the rural areas and existing suburban communities.","The County support of these institutions should reflect the uses of them by Baltimore County residents and schools. Since budgets are tight and there are many other priorities that must have the necessary funding, specifically, this is a very difficult question to definitively answer.","In my lifetime, mass transit in the Baltimore-Metropolitan area has never kept up with the need. First and foremost, existing mass transit must be user-friendly and dependable. For example, express service should become a crucial part of the Light Rail in order to increase ridership. The Light Rail is the least successful mass transit system in the State of Maryland. Because mass transit is operated by the State of Maryland, the Administration and County Delegation to the State Legislature must push for a comprehensive study regarding the mass transit needs of our county. Public input into this process is critical.",What do you consider the greatest accomplishments and failings of the Kamenetz administration?,"Does Baltimore County have adequate resources to meet its needs, particularly to renovate or replace aging schools?

I do believe his interest in higher office, while in line with his ""career path"" means that a lot of things became overtly political and subject to grandstanding. Our County deserves to be the ""best"" in the state, with the best schools, the best public safety and best transportation and utility programs. We can't claim we are the best in those areas, and that probably does fall to our elected leaders.","I don't believe Baltimore County has adequate resources to meet all of the needs of our residents and children if we continually 'shotgun' our spending. We first need to review our County budget and streamline processes and actions to be more efficient and eliminate the inevitable waste (using technology) we see. It's my belief that by making assessments of Opportunity Cost, not just Return on Investment, we will find ways to stay within the budget instead of continually going back to the residents to fund projects. I'm not in favor of increasing taxes to pay for these measures unless it is on a limited time basis because the expectation is that our increasing school desirability will surpass those of neighboring counties and make Baltimore County home values rise to offset such increases. I'm not in favor of increasing local income taxes for the same reason.",I believe that any discrimination is wrong.,"No. Of course the recent ethics violations are horrible and should've been questioned earlier. Just as each family creates a budget and tries to make the tough decisions about their own lives, the school system and the county government should be doing a much better job of cutting waste and assessing Return on Investment, Opportunity Cost of each action and the long term goals (in this case, our goal should be that 90% of our County children, every year, will graduate high school with an opportunity to go to college, speaking at least 2 foreign languages and able to balance their personal budget, and plan their own weekly meals). We aren't even the best in the State of Maryland at doing this, and I believe our current format should be addressed to bring it in line with the best in the State, in the Country and the world.","The primary goals of our County government should be focusing on improving our education system, our public safety and technology use. If we do those things well a) we will find that our County improves its desirability and b) allows us to offer an array future opportunities, like better transportation offerings and business investment. Once that happens aging communities, organically, will develop and sustain themselves.","I personally believe the Baltimore County police are great, but that being said, I believe a) they should have more technology ""weapons"" to assist them and b) more officer mandatory training as the world and our County constantly evolves.","The environment is important to me.

No politician will find cuts, but I believe if like in the private sector we reward county workers financially for finding ways to become more efficient and save money we will find the money in the budget. Example: County worker proposes a new process that saves time and resources. Calculate the year 1 savings and then give that worker a percentage for their idea. Managers would be excluded to prevent budget games that would appear to be savings on paper.","I absolutely do not support the federal housing consent decree and the county should have fought HUD and would have won, similar to Westchester County, NY. I believe a property owner has the right to know where a potential tenant's income is derived from and make decisions based on their comfort level with that tenant's ability to pay and properly maintain their property.","I believe the county government does not have adequate oversight over the school system. I would like more power given to the council, and for a county executive to not turn a blind eye as much.","I'm fervently anti-tax, so it may come as a surprise to people when I tell them I'm in favor of working with the county's state delegation to enable Baltimore County to have a developer fee. I believe if the true cost of new and upgraded infrastructure is born by new developments and not the country taxpayers as a whole- the costs of upgrading existing stock would look better in comparison. As someone who completely remodeled our 60s rancher, I know how great these older homes can be with some love and I'd like to see targeted tax incentives for infill development and remodeling of existing homes in areas where the infrastructure can handle it.","I find the relationship with our county police is being unfairly shaped by a larger national discussion in some instances. If anything, I'd like to enpower communities to have better funded and trained Citizens on Patrol groups that would work closely with law enforcement.","As someone who grew up on Long Island, NY with its seemingly infinite sprawl from NYC- when I moved here I loved how you can be in an urban environment and then quickly in a rural environment. I support the hard stop that the Urban-Rural Demarcation Line represents for sprawl.","While it's clear that a City issue can quickly become a County issue (crime for example)- in my view this kind of support is best addressed at the State of Federal level. Any County support should be looked at on a case by case basis and some kind of return on investment for the two jurisdictions should be clearly laid out, measured and worked toward with accountability.","Environmentally, I believe in practicing what you preach, so I used to ride the bus and currently ride my bicycle from my home in Rosedale to my employer in Towson.

When I took office, more than a dozen schools that serve the Fifth District lacked air conditioning; today, with the completion of renovations at Dumbarton Middle School, every school has air conditioning. Two other schools that serve Towson were renovated - Stoneleigh and Hampton Elementary Schools. In northeastern Baltimore County, three new schools have been budgeted to alleviate overcrowding. The County Executive certainly deserves credit in this regard. The County Executive also deserves credit for advancing the redevelopment of Downtown Towson, although I fault his administration for not thinking more progressively about mobility and the long-term governance of Towson's core. Our office secured funding from the Maryland Transit Administration to study a Towson Circulator; the County Executive refused to provide a local match. The County Executive's senior staff have refused to resurface routes such as Bosley Avenue and Stevenson Lane, partly - I believe - for political reasons. That exposes the biggest failure of the Kamenetz administration. There is a sense among many that the County Executive rewards friends and penalizes opponents. The County Executive's biggest mistakes were self-inflicted, either by him or by his senior staff - the ill-conceived proposal to move the Towson fire station to a park, for example, and the destruction of trees at Bosley Avenue and York Road in violation of a County Council resolution.","No, Baltimore County does not have adequate resources to meet its needs, but the property tax and the local income tax should not be automatically raised. We need to look comprehensively at this issue. Some of our biggest future expenditures will be in education, where it is likely that at least three new high schools will need to be built over the next four years. Baltimore County Public Schools estimates that a single school costs $130 million, but other jurisdictions are constructing schools at a much lower rate, usually between $90 and $110 million. I have raised this issue at several Council meetings, and believe it must be addressed. Second, Baltimore County is alone among Maryland's metropolitan jurisdictions in not levying impact fees on new construction. Under home rule, the Maryland General Assembly must first pass enabling legislation. I support an impact fee ordinance that meets the legal standards of the ""rational nexus"" test, with fees assessed in growth areas for schools required because of new construction. Finally, before considering new taxes, Baltimore County must look at where the jurisdiction's bonding capacity can be modified like was done in Anne Arundel County. There is also a possibility that state aid to Baltimore County might increase with the election of a new Governor or due to increased revenue from changes in the federal tax law.","The County Council did not vote on the federal housing consent decree. I would have opposed it, and I do not support the source-of-income legislation in its current form. The housing decree was overly simplistic. Reducing poverty requires more than shifting poor households to more affluent suburbs; it means that Baltimore County must have a more aggressive job training and transportation strategy. The Kamenetz administration finally began talking about connecting workers to jobs in its eighth year, and has yet to adopt a robust transportation policy. There is a spatial mismatch between where many job seekers live and where most jobs are located, yet we have a Department of Public Works that has very been slow to embrace progressive transit solutions.","No, it does not. The direct election of most of the members of the Board of Education should help increase accountability and transparency, but there needs to be a much stronger auditing power for Baltimore County government. I have either the creation of a Baltimore County Inspector General who would have this power, or giving the Baltimore County Council's Auditors more authority to examine the school system's procurement policies. The Maryland General Assembly would likely need to give the county this power.","Baltimore County can play a critical role in preserving and revitalizing aging communities, along with the state government, local chambers of commerce, and entrepreneurs. I am pleased with the redevelopment that is occurring along the Joppa Road corridor, older areas of Perry Hall, and particularly Downtown Towson. Our office has strongly supported these efforts. I am greatly concerned about the long-term sustainability of Downtown Towson, which has the population to be its own municipality. Downtown Towson competes for scarce resources with every Baltimore County suburb. Under legislation adopted by the Baltimore County Council in the 1990s, a Business Improvement District can be established to pay for activities such as security, landscaping, and improved transportation. I support a vote on a Business Improvement District in the next term. Baltimore County must deal with decaying transportation in many of its older areas. As an example, the intersection of Loch Raven Boulevard and Joppa Road routinely fails Level of Service standards. The county government should work creatively with propertyowners and the state government to address these concerns. As an example, I brokered an agreement with a developer, the state and county governments that has advanced the long-delayed reconstruction of the intersection of Joppa and Harford Roads.","In general, I believe there is an excellent relationship between the Baltimore County Police Department and local communities That relationship has been strengthened by good communication, local partnerships, and an aggressive effort to hire women and minorities so the police force is more reflective of those they serve. I initially opposed the Kamenetz administration's body camera program because I thought it was a rushed decision; however, I now concede the success of this initiaitive. Body cameras provide a greater degree of certainty for both police and citizens by documenting law enforcement activities. I have been an active booster of the Citizens on Patrol program. This initiative needs to be expanded wherever possible. I also believe we need to provide more incentives for police officers to live in Baltimore County's neighborhoods (many reside in Pennsylvania, Harford or Carroll Counties). The Maryland General Assembly passed legislation that allows for Baltimore County to provide a property tax credit to police who decide to live here; this should be means-tested and narrowly focused, but it could help not only with neighborhood safety, but also recruitment.","Yes. The creation of the Urban-Rural Demarcation Line in 1967 is one of Baltimore County's greatest accomplishments. There is perhaps no greater visual evidence of its success than the greenery that characterizes Baltimore County between Hunt Valley and southern Pennsylvania. The Urban-Rural Demarcation Line protests farmland, as well as the county's reservoirs. I will continue to aggressively defend the Urban-Rural Demarcation Line, while targeting the redevelopment of older neighborhoods within its boundaries.","Baltimore County's support for cultural institutions is appropriate, but I do want to make sure that the county's school-age population has access to the places that we support. I am proud that my appointee to the Baltimore County Commission on Arts and Sciences is a public school teacher.","Baltimore County must look at more nimble transit strategies that connect workers to jobs, such as a shuttle program developed in partnership with employers. There are also communities such as Downtown Towson that would benefit from a Circulator. Our office obtained planning money from the Hogan administration to determine routing and costs for a Circulator; hopefully, the next County Executive will be more supportive of this concept. I was the sponsor of legislation that will expand the mission of the Department of Public Works to consider bicycling, pedestrian improvements, and transit where appropriate.

Through the Produce for the People program, the by-product of agricultural education programs, food grown at the farm park, is donated to county homeless shelters and food banks.","Years and years of deferred maintenance combined with increased strain on public infrastructure with population growth, has driven the county to a tipping point. Either we muster the courage to invest in the future today, creating a fertile landscape for new businesses and families to take root, or we continue to put band aids on gaping wounds. Good schools raise According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, there is a definite correlation between school expenditures and home values in any given neighborhood. A report titled, ""Using Market Valuation to Assess Public School Spending,"" found that for every dollar spent on public schools in a community, home values increased $20 and a return of investment of $1.50 is realized. In a small state like Maryland, families have the flexibility of shopping many counties while still being able to commute to and from work. Baltimore must remain competitive. Taxes in and of themselves are not bad. Without taxes we wouldn't have roads, schools, police, libraries, parks and the hundreds of other amenities and services a community needs. The key is spending those precious resource wisely. Prioritizing needs, trimming administratively top-heavy departments, using technology to improve efficiencies, and changing procurement methods are ways to apply existing resources to fulfill these critical needs. However, additional funds may be needed. I do support short-term, targeted revenue generation.","I cannot support the prejudging and denying services based on age, gender, sexual orientation, race, or the use of a voucher to pay a portion of rent. As Atticus Finch tells Scout in To Kill a Mockingbird, ""You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view…until you climb in his skin and walk around in it."" For some, the words housing vouchers can evoke fear, resentment and instability. For others, those same words can evoke hope, opportunity, and stability. There is a massive lack of affordable housing available in the U.S. This, not the vouchers are the issue. Stable, affordable housing is a platform for health, education, jobs, and strong communities. These vouchers exist simply to cover a portion of rent thereby moving a person or a family from a position of instability to stability. A voucher doesn't tell you about a person's values, ideals, moral compass, or judgement. It does indicate that the holder is determined to build a better life for themselves and in doing so, a better community as a whole. It's disingenuous to claim America is the land of opportunity celebrating only the exceptions to the rule, the one in a thousand success, while the true story of the 999 stays hidden in the shadows. To flip the odds, barriers to opportunity need to be removed. Until more affordable housing is made available, these vouchers serve as a pipeline to prosperity - which is the essence of the American Dream.","In a word, no. A hands-off approach has led to a decline in the overall quality of education. Baltimore County Public Schools' administration costs are 6th highest in the nation. Transparency has been replaced with no-bid contracts. Curricular materials chosen for our students do not meet standards of proof that they are effective. Bullying is on the rise and academic performance in on the decline. Schools are overcrowded and crumbling beneath the students' feet. Support services have been woefully underfunded while poverty rates have increased. We cannot afford to write off 52% of the budget – year after year after year. The rubber stamp of apathy that has become the status quo must be discarded in favor of active engagement and oversight.","The post-World War II suburbs that dominate most of Baltimore County must evolve to attract new and young families and support a 21st century world that we are only now beginning to glimpse. • Strong schools are magnets, drawing families to a region. • As retail patterns continue to shift, municipalities must be open to new uses for traditional commercial properties. • Investments in recreational facilities, parks, and bike trails historically provide a positive return in increased property values. • Clean energy and efficiency retrofits not only decrease operational expenses can be a factor in choosing a community. • Embracing innovative technologies can position a community at the head of the line. • Walkable communities benefit the young and the young at heart.","We are well served by the nearly 2,000 professional, committed and caring officers of the Baltimore County Police Department. As communities change and evolve over time, so too must the public institutions. Baltimore County is becoming more diverse. So too should its police force. Research is showing that when a department mirrors the community, it builds trust, and trust is key to forming relationships. Good police to community relationships are essential in maintaining safety. Like teachers in the classroom, police officers are on the front lines of systemic social ills, mental health, sexual assault, addiction, poverty, drugs, homelessness, helplessness. They cannot be asked to serve as counselor, therapist, or case manager, but they can be trained to understand how personal trauma, in all its forms, can manifest itself outwardly in behavior, and how to recognize the symptoms of mental illness, and connect citizens with services that are available. Our police force is a community asset. Let's make sure they have the tools and training they need to be effective while at the same time walking upstream to solve problems at their source.","The Urban Rural Demarcation Line (URDL) is a living testament to the power of big picture thinking combined with long-range planning and political will. At the height of the suburban revolution, the county took its foot off the peddle, slowed down, and made a commitment to its future. It has helped to preserve the agricultural legacy and industry in the county, wildlife habitat, and water quality. The URDL came on line in 1965. This county council must now look for the next URDL – the next long-term planning tool that in fifty years will be seen as being just as pivotal in the history or Baltimore County than the URDL has been.","The county and the city. Like siblings it can be a love one minute and hate the next, but we are and always will be connected and interdependent. The success or failure of one impacts the other positively or negatively. Therefore, continued support of important cultural institutions is in the county's best interest. County residents depend on the aquarium, the Baltimore Museum of Art, the Science Center, and dozens of others for entertainment, education, and enlightenment. Yet, many more county residents, those with financial challenges may never step foot inside a museum. Therefore, I believe that we may need to rethink how the money contributed by the county to the city may be used to benefit more wholly the residents of the county. Therefore, a percentage of the direct grants to the institutions could be targeted to fund in class or out of class field trips, or coupons for low income county residents, many of whom are seniors, to visit. The 3.9 million that Kamenetz has budgeted for arts and culture in the 2019 budget represents .1% of the whole budget. Vibrant arts and culture cannot be relegated solely to the city. We need to invest closer to home as well, not only for the economic benefits, which are many, but also to inspire. Creativity is a top trait business is seeking in new employees. ""This world is but a canvas to our imagination."" Henry David Thoreau.","Getting to a doctor's appointment, school, a job, or the grocery store. If you are carless, these routine tasks aren't so routine. I checked a few apps and found that on average, using the current public transportation options to get from Timonium to CCBC in Catonsville took 90 minutes, but only 30 minutes by car. That's a 2-hour difference per day, 10 hours per week, and 40 hours per month. Inefficient public transportation is an impediment to upward mobility, health and education. It is, however, a very effective catalyst for car ownership which results in more traffic, more pollution, and more personal expenses in the form of insurance, gas, maintenance, and perhaps parking. The problem is a symptom of car-centric suburban design. The answer is not as easy to define. When we make the path to prosperity easier to navigate, more people will succeed. That has a net positive for the entire community. Thus, we need to boldly tackle the problem with a suite of solutions with an eye towards infrastructure requirements associated with the impending autonomous vehicle revolution which is on its way.",What do you consider the greatest accomplishments and failings of the Kamenetz administration?,"Does Baltimore County have adequate resources to meet its needs, particularly to renovate or replace aging schools?

I recently completed my master's degree in public management from Johns Hopkins University and completed the Leadership Baltimore County program.","I was the youngest gubernatorial appointee in the administration of former Governor Bob Ehrlich having served as a spokesperson for the Maryland Aviation Administration which includes BWI Airport and Martin State Airport in Middle River.

Recently, I served as an appointee of Governor Larry Hogan at the Maryland Transit Administration (MTA) as the senior director of communications and marketing for the agency. In this role, I managed a team of nearly 30 people and oversaw a multi-million dollar marketing and communications budget for the agency that delivers transit options to the residents of Maryland. For my efforts in this role I was recognized by the Maryland Daily Record newspaper as one of their VIP List, which is 40 people under 40 who are leaders in the Baltimore area. I also received a similar 40 under 40 distinction from the national industry publication Mass Transit Magazine for my work transforming the MTA's communications efforts.

The Kamenetz Administration has undertaken record borrowing and out-of-control spending that has resulted in the independent credit rating corporation, Moody's, downgrading the County to a negative credit outlook. This is the first step towards a credit rating downgrade. A downgrade would cost the County significantly more borrow funds and could have a serious impact on the County's finances. If we continue down this path, we will be forced to make drastic cuts or increase taxes. We need to live within our means as a county. Another significant failing of the Kamenetz Administration has been its unwillingness to work in a cooperative way with its partners at the state level in the Hogan Administration. An inability to work with the Governor in a bipartisan manner does not serve the citizens of Baltimore County.","The County has many unmet needs, but increasing taxes is not the solution. I oppose any increase in fees or taxes. Until we can definitively show that all of our tax dollars are being spent in the most effective and efficient way, residents of the county will continue to have concerns about the management of the county's funds. The county would be best served by focusing on growing its tax base through smart economic development, eliminating government waste, and exercising better oversight of BCPS finances. This approach increase revenue without burdening taxpayers who already pay higher taxes than many other area counties.","No, Baltimore County's federal housing consent decree was negotiated without any feedback from the county council. This is a major mistake. Just as in Washington, when Congress votes on major trade deals or treaties, the county council should have had a say in the negotiation process. To deprive the county's legislative body of any say in the process does not help to increase public support or frankly provide the appearance of transparency in these negotiations. No, I do not support forcing rental property owners to be forced to accept any particular type of payment. While affordable housing is a reasonable goal, requiring housing vouchers does not get to the core issues of affordable housing in the county such as the amount of housing stock.","Absolutely not! The county should conduct a non-partisan, independent audit of the entire BCPS budget to ensure that all our hard-working citizens' tax dollars are being spent as effectively and efficiently as possible. The current proposed audit of technology contracts simply does not go far enough. This is critically important after the recent corruption charges against former Baltimore County Public Schools Superintendent Dallas Dance and former BCPS employee Bob Barrett. Many feel that there is a lack of accountability and control in our system. We simply must have an audit to restore faith in the system. When test scores are lackluster and apparent corruption is rampant, it is well-past time for the council to exercise fiscal oversight of the agency that spends most of Baltimore County's tax revenue.","Baltimore County has many aging neighborhoods that are in need of revitalization. Improving our schools and reducing crime will go a long way in helping to accomplish this goal. The county government should incentive revitalization through targeted tax credits. This targeted tax credit was enabled by our delegation in Annapolis but has had no action by the council. The county should also consider proximity to aging neighborhoods when zoning and approving large new home projects. By saturating the housing market with new construction, you disincentive revitalization in aging communities.","I think Baltimore County Police do an excellent job and have made significant progress in improving relationships with the community despite a lack of funding and attention from the current administration. However, we still need an increased focus on community outreach. Many in the community, particularly young people, seem to feel a strong disconnect with law enforcement. Providing positive interactions with law enforcement such as through recreating Police Athletic League (PAL) centers would help in this process. County Officers do not have access to needed-resources and many positions regularly remain unfunded. With a violent crime increase of 32% last year in eastern Baltimore County, there are fundamental concerns that need to be addressed. For instance, having only one K-9 unit location in Dundalk is problematic for a county as large as Baltimore County. Systemic issues such as these place a strain on a force that is already dealing with increased crime, particularly violent crime. A greater emphasis on regional police cooperation is also necessary given the significant challenges Baltimore City is facing and a growing Opioid epidemic that knows no jurisdictional boundaries.","Yes, the Urban-Rural Demarcation Line (URDL) continues to serve the county's needs. With many schools already overcrowded and many failing intersections in eastern Baltimore County, removing the URDL would only hasten overcrowding issues in many areas. The URDL has been a largely successful policy because the county has adhered relatively closely to the original plan. The county would be wise to do the same thing when considering other development projects, such as the development that has occurred along the Rt. 43 corridor. Initially, this corridor was supposed to be a jobs center without residential housing, however, the county has bent to development pressures and decided to place large amounts of housing in this area that were not in the original plan. This has further increased overcrowding concerns in area schools and on area roads. This plan demonstrates that taking a consistent approach like the URDL creates certainty in the county that should be adhered to in all areas of development.","Baltimore County spends too much on Baltimore City's cultural institutions. The nearly $30 million we spend to subsidize Baltimore City could be better spent in our classrooms, in our police department, or on improving the number of failing intersections in the county. Until we can handle the basic needs of the county, we should not subsidize arts and entertainment in other jurisdictions.","Baltimore County has seen an increase in Mass Transit Service under the Hogan Administration. There are many opportunities to embrace new and cutting-edge transit concepts (such as deviated route demand-response, ride sharing, and bicycle facilities that will connect our residents to jobs). I will use my experience to find and implement these new solutions to connect our residents to the many opportunities available in our region.

The administration has invested $1.3 billion in school construction and renovation. Shortcomings – The pattern of a small group of stakeholders having a disproportionate amount of influence continues in Baltimore County. There are a handful of developers and a handful of law firms that influence the majority of development projects in Baltimore County, especially in the 2nd District. There are many stakeholders who are not afforded the same level of engagement. These include community leaders, environmental advocates and the small business community. Having such a small group have so much influence stifles creativity and lends itself to creating an environment where a gas station can be viewed as a good gateway project as was proposed in Towson. It also creates an environment where transparency can be questioned. There are many creative developers and talented law firms that should have a seat at the table. There is also room for community leadership and small business organizations to be at the table as well.","I do not support increasing the property tax nor do I support increasing local income tax. Baltimore County absolutely needs additional funding to renovate or replace aging schools. I am particularly concerned about Dulaney High School. I would request that the Department of Planning conduct a thorough review of all capital projects that have been dormant for more than one year. Previously allocated funds should be recommended for de-appropriation to the Planning Board and then re-appropriated to address our aging school infrastructure. Further, I will work with State legislative partners to increase school funding. Funding needs for Maryland schools have changed since the Thornton Commission, and Baltimore County needs to address those changes. The Kirwin Commission has made recommendations that are fundamental to improving education in Maryland, including pre-K, highly qualified teachers who are compensated appropriately, effective technical education, and resources for at-risk students. Baltimore County and other jurisdictions do not invest enough for its schools. This is affirmed in a recently released Goucher Poll (February 2018) which stated a majority of Democrats (81%), Independents (73%), and Republicans (51%) felt that government spends too little on public schools, a strong bipartisan coalition.",Every family deserves the dignity of having good place to live. I do support Baltimore County's federal housing consent decree and the placement of families with housing vouchers in areas of opportunity throughout the county. I believe the consent decree promotes future fair housing compliance and enforcement through education and outreach initiatives,"More oversight over the school system is needed especially now. Recently, the former Superintendent of Baltimore County Schools pleaded guilty to four counts of perjury for failing to disclose nearly $150,000 he earned from outside consulting jobs while running the school system. Additionally, the school system's community and government liaison pleaded guilty to tax-evasion and bribery-related charges. For the first time, the Baltimore County will have a hybrid school board that includes elected members from each council district. I look forward to working with the 2nd District School Board Member to elevate oversight of school system financial activities so we never subject our students, families, teachers, administrators, school employees and other stakeholders to unethical leadership that ultimately hurts everyone.","The majority of residents live inside the Urban Rural Demarcation Line -URDL (90 percent of Baltimore County's population still lives inside the URDL, and two-thirds of its land remains rural.) The needs of inner beltway neighborhoods can be different than more suburbanized or rural communities. For the 2nd District it is critical to have Pikesville and Reisterstown as strong commercial districts that are full of vitality. This will serve to enhance the broader community. For Pikesville, we need a commercial revitalization plan that is compatible and complementary to the Pikesville Armory Commission recommendations. The plan and the initiative need to be BOLD, and transformative! We need more green space in Pikesville. Reisterstown is lovely and the community is full of energy. We need a strong Reisterstown Main Street Plan that is implementable and provides incentives for small business owners. After knocking on over 7,000 doors in the 2nd District, I hear a recurring theme from residents that the county does not follow up on issues. Follow up on constituent services can go a long way to improving the way people feel about their neighborhood. Finally, baby boomers are becoming older adults. We will need facilities that support our young families as well as the growing older adult population.","I attend Police District Community Relations Council meetings on a regular basis. These include the Pikesville Precinct, the Franklin Precinct and the Cockeysville Precinct. I believe these meetings offer a strong opportunity for community leaders and law enforcement officials to have a good dialogue with the intent of keeping our communities safe. I plan to continue to work closely with the Pikesville, Franklin and Cockeysville Police District Community Relations Councils. I also plan to work closely with the leadership of Baltimore City and the command staff of Northwestern and Northern Police Districts in Baltimore City. This is particularly important since much of the 2nd District borders along the City/County line. My public safety agenda also includes pedestrian safe and vehicular safety (especially speeding).","The 2nd District has great beauty in its urban and rural character. Development needs to be done right with respect to the environment and with respect to the community. I plan on keeping the integrity of the Urban-Rural Demarcation Line, which was established in 1967. Inside the URDL is higher density development. Outside the URDL is much lower density. So the idea is to have growth where you plan to have growth. This demarcation line is a model for the state and the entire nation in terms of how to plan for good development. I will hold that line where it is. Currently zoning policies can work, however it is compromised because the current Planning Board does not consider the sentiment of all stakeholders in a fair way.","I think it is important for Baltimore County to provide a reasonable level of support to arts, humanities and cultural organizations that serve Baltimore County residents, but may be located in Baltimore City. I believe this is especially true for institutions that provide a learning experience for our children. It is also important to have strong cultural institutions in Baltimore County. The Pikesville Armory has great potential for being a cultural hub in the 2nd District of Baltimore County.","I ride both the Metro and the Light Rail on a regular basis. I believe that the 2nd District of Baltimore County has better mass transit opportunities than the rest of the county. This is primarily because the Metro and the Light Rail lines run right through the district. However, transit needs to be safe.

This was such an egregious and malicious administrative act which garnered over 10,000 signed petitioners that it currently sits at the highest levels of our state in suspension with the board of public works who's members are the governor or MD, Lawrence Hogan, comptroller of Maryland, Peter Franchot and the treasurer of Maryland, Nancy Kopp. Additionally, Dundalk United members are still engaged in a civil action that cost the community untold hours of volunteerism that could've been devoted to the benefit of community members, untold amounts of money that could've went to community benefit instead of lawyer fees against the very government that we pay taxes to support and pay for the very officials that we elect that are legally bound to follow in any democratic society the people, whom they derive their power from, the electorate.","When one says ""Baltimore County,"" one has to say who is Baltimore county? Baltimore County is the residents, the businesses, the tax payers of this area. So, rephrasing the question, do the residents, businesses, tax payers have adequate resources to meet its needs? Categorically, yes. Are we properly resourced with an administration? If we were, I would not be running for office in the 7th District of Baltimore County. I believe that the residents of Baltimore County at a community level need to be engaged and informed of the cost of each individual school within their community and how the cost of renovations or replacement of these schools will affect the budget in these most trying times with pensions coming due, state pensions coming due and the fact that we're funding industrial redevelopment at Sparrows Point in the hundreds of millions, yet there's no question in this questionnaire about whether we have money to fund them. Yet, you're asking me if we have money to fund our children's schools. How did the current councilman force through (without a complete disclosure) a tax incremental resolution that he himself doesn't understand, much less the communities he's supposed to represent? I pose, if we have hundreds of millions to finance industrial development, we certainly have money to fund the development of our children!","I was sent a Facebook a link for Mr. Steve McIntire (candiate for State Delegate for District 42A).

Transparency and accountability. Until every question of Mr. McIntire's video has been adequately answered, I can in no way in good conscious support Baltimore County's housing consent decree.","It is glaringly apparent of the complete failure of Baltimore County to provide adequate oversight with the school system with the recent national scandal of Dallas Dance. It is my sincere hope that with my elected school board, we will be spared any additional future denigration of the office of Superintendent of Baltimore County Schools.",First there should be a moratorium if not a complete suspension of Planned Unit Developments. I'm personally aware of multiple communities that have raised overwhelming opposition to these giants of the oligarchy where they get preferential treatment circumventing the zoning laws at the expense of the communities. I personally testified in December against the 43 million dollars that was awarded from the taxpayer coffers from the Baltimore county citizens to the benefit of a developer because of their geotechnical mistake - an amount argued upwards of 43 million dollars which could've paid for one and a half brand new elementary schools in our county. The county administrator and the department of planning have almost turned a complete blind eye to all of the technology that conclusively shows that preserving older buildings eliminates further greenhouse emissions from the production of new building materials while at the same time preserving our cultural heritage. Endless articles have been published by the national trust historic that are readily available to the public including the planning and county administrators. with all of our shorelines slated for a 1 to 2 foot sea level rise by 2050 I would be a strong advocate of any measures that would reduce greenhouse gases while preserving the history of our county for our children and our children's children.,"I must admit that as a community leader and as a leader of the Civic Council for the entire 7th district with strong ties and respect to our first-responders, admittedly with my experience as a trained a Citizen on Patrol member and a member of the 12th Precinct Police Community Relations Council, I believe the relationship between Baltimore County Police and communities are good. The question is the judicial. In my opinion, the police are just half of the equation - recently a man was arrested after a dramatic accident at the intersection of Wise & Merritt Blvd. crippling a woman in after striking her with his car while intoxicated. This was his 3rd offense driving while intoxicated. By the time he appeared in court for this 3rd DWI, he had been charged with driving without a license. His punishment was 0 days in jail by a city judge that was brought in to hear this case. Law enforcement can arrest all the criminals 24/7, but without proper adjudication and sentencing to modify their behavior and conform to social standards, we will continue, unfortunately to see more DWI's, 3rd offenders - destroying peoples lives.","The county nor the state funds survey work at sufficiently high levels, because both parties favor development. They want to tear down and develop the rest of Maryland. Baltimore County is already over 55% developed. The State land area was already 30% developed by 2010. Since then 68,000 additional housing units were built in Maryland There are at least 8,000 more units already zoned for the Baltimore County rural area. All elected officials, blue and red and purple need to grandfather this out with a combination of a Transfer of Density Rights program (TDR), purchase of development rights, in addition to the conservation easements and some downzoning. The county and state's natural heritage is steadily disappearing. Less birds, less forests, more buildings, more roads every year. The same state and county administrations that teach ""environmental sustainability"" in the schools issue permits from the zoning counter (or state licenses) everyday to further destroy the environment. It seems like there's a ""greenwashing"" system to make it seem like something is getting done when it clearly is not.","Baltimore County lent assistance of both tax payer money and life and limb contending with the riots recently experienced. I believe Baltimore County's support for the cultural institution of civility in Baltimore City was demonstrated in an exemplary manner with that assistance. To my knowledge, the good tax payers of Baltimore Co have never been reimbursed monetarily for that assistance. So to your answer, I think the good people of Baltimore County and our first-responders have been generous in their support. There is no greater support for your neighbors than risking your life to help them in time of need.","By nature Baltimore County is a suburb and as a suburb its growth was largely due to personal transportation. Currently, many citizens of our district commute anywhere from 20 minutes to 2 hours a day to their places of employment. It can be readily seen at Back River Neck Bridge to 695. The beltway traffic is worse now than when they expanded the lanes. I experience this every morning on my way to work. So, when we have tens of thousands of automobiles in transit every day around 695, 95, 97, 295, & 895, I submit to you; this question is highly debatable and requires intensive study.",What do you consider the greatest accomplishments and failings of the Kamenetz administration?,"Does Baltimore County have adequate resources to meet its needs, particularly to renovate or replace aging schools?

,YES,baltimore-county/county-council,1,Sheila Ruth,Ruth,10/22/1963,Catonsville,Democratic,"In 1995 I earned a B.S. degree with Highest Honors in Liberal Arts and Technology: Computers, from Stevenson University, formerly Villa Julie College. I completed most of my college degree as a part-time student while working full-time, after taking a hiatus after graduation from Glenelg High School in Glenelg, Maryland.","A rich variety of experiences have led to my candidacy for County Council. I run a publishing company and website development business. As a small business owner, I understand the difficulties they face when large corporations have more power than ever to eliminate competition. I revitalized the nearly defunct Mid-Atlantic Book Publishers Association when I was its President, and I'm currently the Vice-President of the Cybils Awards, a nonprofit children's literature award. In recent years, my focus has been progressive political activism. I'm on the Board of Directors for Get Money Out - Maryland and I founded the Baltimore County Progressive Democrats Club. I was on the steering committee of the Our Revolution Baltimore City/County Chapter.",https://www.sheilaruth.com,,standupwithruth,http://surveygizmoresponseuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/fileuploads/296249/4299880/44-84493c9a5c8ee31fd47de8e9bdf0a560_library-headshot.jpg,"The Kamenetz administration's greatest failing is its lack of transparency. For example, deals such as the Towson Gateway project and the Towson Row assistance package have been negotiated in secret and presented for approval with very little notice. On the Towson Gateway property, 30 trees, including 100-year-old specimen oaks, were removed without any notice and in violation of a County Council resolution. The one area in which County Executive Kevin Kamenetz has done well is promoting diversity and combating discrimination. Last year, he signed an order prohibiting county discrimination against people based on immigration status, and limiting police cooperation with federal immigration authorities without a judicial warrant. In 2012, under his leadership, Baltimore County passed a law adding protection for gender identity and expression to the county's existing nondiscrimination law.","According to Baltimore County's FY2019 Spending Affordability Report, we are near or at the limits of what we can afford to borrow. Yet we still have unmet capital construction needs, such as schools that are overcrowded and/or in poor condition. The first thing I would advocate is taking a hard look at our priorities. Looking back in recent years, the county could've made different choices to free up more funds for these critical infrastructure issues. Hundreds of millions of dollars were spent on laptops for every child and associated technology, some of it in no-bid contracts that we now know were tainted by ethical issues. Better choices in piloting and implementing this program would've left money for building livable schools. Repealing the Stormwater Remediation Fee was a cruel deception. The county is still legally and morally obligated to fund mitigation of toxic runoff into the Bay.. The homeowner share of this fee was minimal--26 dollars a year--with businesses paying the larger share. Instead, at least $16 million a year, money that could have been spent on school infrastructure, must be taken from other parts of the budget to pay for it. I would also consider alternative sources of revenue, such as developer impact fees that offset the development's impact on infrastructure.These are only three examples of the many choices we could make differently to free up more money for urgent needs like school construction.","In 2016, Baltimore County settled a federal housing discrimination complaint. As part of the settlement, Baltimore County agreed to incentivize developers to create affordable housing in more prosperous areas of the county, and to introduce a bill to prevent housing discrimination against people using federal housing vouchers. However, the county wasn't required to pass the bill, , known as the HOME Act. Six out of the seven current County Council members, including my opponent, voted against it, voting to continue housing discrimination. I have made passing the HOME Act a priority in my campaign. Discrimination of any kind is simply unacceptable. If elected, I will do everything I can to pass the HOME Act and develop affordable housing in areas of the county without enough. Giving people more housing options will allow them to move closer to good jobs and schools, potentially boosting their income and raising the standard of living countywide.","Recent incidents indicate that clearly more oversight is needed, including independent audits of school contracts.","The county has neglected areas urgently in need of revitalization. This should be the primary use of incentives: to encourage economic development in communities with urgent need, and those where investment will make the biggest difference. However, such economic development needs to be carefully planned to preserve green space, maintain the historic and community character, and avoid gentrification and displacement of current residents. Such development should only be undertaken in consultation with all stakeholders-- including members of affected communities. Such development should include a mixture of housing levels, including affordable housing, as well as retail and office space in green, walkable communities.","My respect and appreciation for police officers who risk their lives and serve the community cannot erase incidents like the deaths of Korryn Gaines and Tawon Boyd, which indicate that Baltimore County Police need training in de-escalation techniques and handling people exhibiting signs of mental illness. Community policing, placing officers in the same neighborhoods consistently, and having them spend some time on foot getting to know the community should be standard whenever possible. Some areas of Baltimore County are too spread out for community policing to be effective, but others are perfect. The department's training and culture should always emphasize that police should be in solidarity with communities they serve, not in opposition to them.","The URDL does a good job of protecting the more rural areas of the county. However, within the urban side of the URDL, development is often done with little planning or forethought, merely rubber stamping developer plans, rather than creating the ""compact, mixed-use, walkable design consistent with existing community character"" advocated for in the 2020 Baltimore County Master Plan. There are areas of the county that badly need development to restore communities, lessen blight, and revitalize ailing commercial corridors. I would proactively work with communities to help develop a vision for the community, and then reach out to developers and businesses to make that vision a reality.","Baltimore County residents have easy access to a wealth of cultural institutions in the city, including museums, theatres, and the zoo. For Baltimore County to provide grants as we do to the city's institutions seems reasonable, given that we benefit from this abundance. However, thinking only in terms of cultural institutions is too limiting. Although Baltimore City and County are separate jurisdictions, in many ways we are inextricably linked. There are many opportunities, such as transit, affordable housing, and economic development, where working together could benefit both of us. Such regional thinking could also increase the influence of the city and county in dealing with the state, developers, and businesses.","Getting around Baltimore County by mass transit is difficult, because most transit in the area is oriented either towards getting to and from the city or Washington, DC. Even traveling in and out of the city can require a multi-hour bus ride. The canceled red line would have helped to get people to and from jobs, and I support restarting the project if the state can find a way. Baltimore County is in some areas too spread out for mass transit to be effective. One partial solution would be developing walkable, mixed-use communities near the existing mass transit stations. Of course, this would not enable people to get to areas of the county poorly served by mass transit, but it would allow people who use mass transit, by choice or necessity, to live in a place with easy access to shopping, jobs, and entertainment.",What do you consider the greatest accomplishments and failings of the Kamenetz administration?,"Does Baltimore County have adequate resources to meet its needs, particularly to renovate or replace aging schools?
