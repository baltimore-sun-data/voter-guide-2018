Funding has also been provided for the construction of the new Havre de Grace High School/Middle School.  Additionally, 2500 private sector jobs were added in the last 3 years. I do not believe the Glassman administration had any failings, but I would like to have seen more emphasis placed on economic development and the revitalization of the Rt. 40 corridor in Harford County.","Yes.  Each year for the past 3 budget cycles, the Harford County budget met or exceeded Maintenance of Effort standards for education funding.  The majority of new county revenue in the past 3 years has gone to fund pay increases for law enforcement and teachers.  There is always more that could be accomplished provided we had an open-ended budget, but in reality, that is not an option for most governmental budgets.  There has been much progress in the past 3 ½ years to return funding to our law enforcement and school systems.  We are fortunate to have good leadership and sound fiscal management with the vision to provide these necessities.","Yes.  Approximately 80% of Harford County's population lives in about 18% of its land mass, called the Development Envelope, whose goal is to allow for growth in a very defined area while maintaining our rural heritage.  Harford County has consistently ranked in the top tier of all counties in the United States for the last two decades in preserving its agricultural land.  This is especially noteworthy considering our proximity to the heavily developed I-95 corridor.  Recently, additional areas have been included to study for possible expansion of Harford County's Development Envelope.","The county's efforts to fight the opioid addiction overdoses can be rated as strong and pro-active.  True partnerships between the community, County Government, the Sheriff's Office, the Courts, the Health Department, the Upper Chesapeake Health System and many more have been recognized at the state and national level, but there is much more work to be done as our citizens are dying from this addiction.  Our community focuses are on prevention and education, treatment and enforcement.  I would like to see more education during school classroom hours and in after-school programs to warn our youth of the hazards of opioid usage.  Regular education made available to the general public is a must in keeping us informed.","The Harford County Sheriff's Office has a strong, respectful relationship with the community that is steadily improving.  As a Councilmember for the last 3 ½ years, I have been a witness, and in some cases, a participant to many of the new and innovative strategies the Sheriff's Office employs to better communicate and partner with our citizens.  The Sheriff's Heroin Overdose Prevention Workgroup, Sheriff's Foundation, Diversity Hiring Workgroup, Traffic Safety Advisory Board, and Town Hall events are examples of the openness the Sheriff's Office has with the Harford County community.","As Harford County has grown in population, it has become more difficult to provide ambulance and EMS services on a full-time basis, especially during  normal business hours, when many of our volunteers may be at work.  I am extremely proud of our volunteer fire and EMS personnel and hold them in the highest esteem and do not agree that paid personnel are necessarily more professional as the question states.  The addition of the county-paid personnel has created some conflict between the Glassman administration and the volunteer services.

He has successfully restored the fund balance and achieved triple-A Bond rating for the County. Harford has a large population of seniors (Bel Air was named the best place to retire in Maryland) and the county administration adopted a tax credit for seniors and retired military. The County has also implemented new apps and modernized permitting for citizens. As Mayor of Bel Air, I know that the citizens of the Town and County have benefitted from strong new partnerships including recent construction of a water impoundment and connecting the Ma & Pa Trail. The Town, County and State Highway Administration continue to work together to address issues related to traffic congestion and pedestrian safety.","Harford should have adequate resources to meet the needs of our evolving county. Public education is a priority because our children are our future. In the past three years, we have increased funding by $15 million for schools. School safety and teacher retention are two of my priorities. The State's Kirwan Commission recently concluded that there must be changes in how teachers are recruited, paid and deployed. Current salaries and working conditions are having a negative impact on recruitment and retention. Regarding school safety, cooperation among State, County and the three Towns in Harford has already begun with the promise to hire more SROs.","Harford County is strong in its land use policies. We strive for an orderly development of land and in an environmentally sound manner. I have participated in creating and implementing the Town of Bel Air's Sustainability Plan since 2013. It has guided Town efforts regarding energy, water, air quality, economic development, and health, cultural and historic resources. We work closely with the Department of Natural Resources Forest Service through our Tree Committee. On a countywide scale, HarfordNEXT vision is a good example of government transparency and citizen involvement with land use policies. Two strategies highlighting land use are 'innovative development emphasizing sustainability' and 'Green Infrastructure Planning'.","The County has dedicated resources in addressing this opioid epidemic but this is a national crisis and will not be conquered quickly. Partnerships have been successful in bringing leaders from Aberdeen Proving Ground, state and local government, business and non-profits together to address these problems. I have attended several summits and had the opportunity to speak with mayors from all 156 Towns and Cities in Maryland to discuss what is working and what is not working. Our Town Police Department is taking a proactive measure to support recovery after they encounter an overdose victim. We are partnering with community agencies to form a team. After following routine overdose protocol, a responding BAPD officer will be able to connect the individual with intervention services and a team with a recovery coach. This team will also link families and significant others to support services. The County Administration plans to open our first 24-Hour Crisis Center to provide access to those in need of crisis treatment and care. To recoup the financial costs for these projects, we will be joining other Towns and Counties in suing the opioid manufacturers and distributors.","The role of law enforcement has dramatically expanded in our society. Terrorism, mass shootings and cybercrime have required the Sheriff's Office to take on more responsibility. The Harford County Sheriff's Office provides prompt and professional service to our residents. The Sheriff's Office has precincts where the officers are a significant part of the community. The Harford County Sheriff's Office sponsors neighborhood watch programs, a Citizens Police Academy, an Explorer Post and Summer Youth Camps in an effort to involve the community","We love our 12 volunteer fire companies in Harford County and the long history of men and women who fought fires and saved lives. Harford County has grown in population while fire companies are struggling to recruit and train members. Executive Glassman has proposed a phased-in transition to develop Harford County Emergency Medical Services to supplement the medical services provided by our volunteer fire companies. We need to respect the existing volunteers and their long time service to our communities but look at paid EMS in order to provide additional medical services to our growing county. Statistics show that the baby boom generation is aging and the number of empty-nester households is expected to double between 2000 and 2020. Retirement communities, assisted living facilities and long-term care units are increasing in Harford County.

Mr. Glassman has done well with funding for Education and the Sheriffs Office. Would have liked to have seen Economic Development back in Belair alongside permits. That would make sense to me, being able to aid development in the permitting process.","I think we have to find a way to increase resources and streamline existing resources to meet our future needs. Our schools and our children are Harford's future. The Harford Sheriffs Office will have to grow and modernize to meet our future needs. I still believe we will need a helicopter in the future for crime prevention, especially in our rural areas. After we sold ""Eagle One"" we waited over an hour for a State Police or Baltimore County helicopter to assist the Sheriff.","I think as a Council we need to revisit Eminent Domain Rights. Harford County Citizens rights have been eroding lately. I would also like to do away with the new 3 minute speaking rule. The Council is the peoples place to voice their concerns, especially with land use and zoning laws. We also need equitable enforcement of land use policies. This has been a major problem.","I rate the County and Sheriffs Office AAA+ on the Opioid fight, it has hit Harford extremely hard. I personally think we should plan more treatment and programs for the addict. We need to treat all Harford Citizens as human beings and with respect. As such, we all need and have a duty to get involved.","While the Harford County Sheriffs Office has a good relationship with the communities it serves, I think it could be better. The Sheriffs could do a better job of stopping and getting to know the community, this would aid also in information. Also would like more transparency in the reporting of crime. The prior administration had more reports in The Aegis and responded to community concerns much better. When better informed, you have the information necessary to inform police and keep your community safe.","I think as the county grows we will need a Professional Organization.

They are at the forefront of fighting this disease and are a role model for the rest of the country.  I think Mr. Glassman inherited a large number of fiscal problems that he has just now been able to turn around. He is actively working to raise the pay of teachers, law enforcement, and other critical Harford County employees.  I am a Democrat and I am a fan of Barry Glassman. He is friendly, approachable,  has good common sense and is a fiscally smart steward of the finances of this county.","No. Even though I am a fan of Mr. Glassman's, I believe, as does he, that we need to do better with our funding of Education.   Our teachers are our heroes. They do the most important work that can be done for any of us - they teach our children and provide them with an education that can make or break them the rest of their lives.  Yet, our teachers do not make the equivalent of other professional salaries. What is worse, many of the teachers in Harford County are leaving and getting jobs as teachers in neighboring counties. We have to act swiftly to keep our teachers. We must raise their pay, fund their pensions and provide them with the resources they need to do their jobs.   Our members of law enforcement have been dealing with low salaries compared to adjoining counties. We must raise their pay to keep them here in Harford County. We can not afford a brain drain from our teachers or our law enforcement officers.","I am running for the office of Harford County Council President because I have been disappointed with the way Harford County handles zoning and the lack of support it gives is citizens in regards to zoning issues.   When David Craig was our County Executive, I had a fight with my next door neighbor who happens to be Jones Subaru. Jones acquired the former Hinder Car dealership that sat dormant for several years. Jones tore down trees between our property (buffer area and part of a utility easement), expanded their building, and tripled the size of their parking lot. All of this was done without filing a single permit. They were ""grandfathered in""??? Then they erected stadium lighting that per our lighting expert (used in court)  stated the lighting was the equivalent of 3 football/baseball stadiums.  We contacted our councilman for District B, Joe Woods, initial concern but then no help. Contacted Harford County Zoning. No help. They are grandfathered in.....  Contacted Jones Subaru. No help. They laughed at us. Contacted BG&E - no help. We have a contract with Jones.  Contacted David Craig who was driving a brand new Jones truck - no help.   It took 2 years and 60k in legal fees to get some of that lighting subdued.   I think that Harford County Zoning meetings should be open and transparent and filmed. No decisions should be made behind closed doors.  All of the affected community groups must be represented and present for the decision- making process.","I think the county is doing a superb job of fighting the opioid epidemic. They are activiely training recovery coaches, holding a variety to training seminars, conducting plays, etc.  I would like to see more people who are trained in recovery, be required to provide some type of volunteer service to give back to the community. Most of the people who work in this field are just too emotionally drained to give more at the end of their day.  So, I encourage training people outside of the field.  What else can Harford County do? Provide training to students (do not give this task to teachers) on how to cope with the terrible issues we face in life such as being ugly, called fat, stupid, etc. How to deal with rejection and life's ills. This is what causes people to turn to drugs. We must teach coping skiils. This will help with addiction and violence.   I am going to be self serving here. I was helped with a 40 plus year smokeless tobacco addiction by an online site called http://killthecan.org. I started Quit The Habit to provide the same type of recovery support to help people quitting heroin and opioid addiction. I want my site to be the hub for people in recovery, anywhere in the nation to come and get and give support.   We should train more recovery coaches and get them to my site to help the public.  It is self funded and free.","I think that the Sherff's Office is held in high regard.  I met one of the captains in their force at a recent Edgewood town meeting and was quite impressed, even though he was from New York:). My parents are from New York.  If other captains visit their local town halls and are open to discussions with members in the community as this captain did, then I believe the county is well served. He said contact him any time for any reason. He agreed to serve as escalation point. I was very impressed.   I would like to see less serious treatment of youth with drug offenses. I think sending them to jail or juvenile facilities will make things worse and lead them to a life of crime and drugs. I would like to find opportunities for them to get training, a big brother or sister to guide them to a better path. Many of these youth may have been raised in troubled households.... Let's see if we can get them an apprenticeship or some other opportunites.  We have an opportunity to turn these youth around...","After seeing this question, I researched this topic.  I would encourage Harford County to not move the volunteer fire and emergency medical services out-of-the-way but instead, to incorporate them into their plan.  Make these wonderful volunteers who have so nobly served this county full time Harford County employees and phase in the assumption of these fire deparmentments and EMSs in a thoughtful and caring way.

I am glad that the administration was able to give long overdue pay raises to teachers.  I also am glad that his administration has worked to develop online communication tools and apps for convenient access to information.   Some areas of focus I would like to see are: Advocacy for more state funding for Harford County Public Schools, we are ranked 23 out of 24 public school systems in Maryland in terms of per pupil funding, and with the pending closing of Union Memorial Hospital in Havre de Grace, we need to advocate for a full service hospital replacement.   Our county continues to grow and would greatly benefit from two full service hospitals to care for our residents.","No, we need more funding to keep good teachers and police officers.   We are losing great teachers to surrounding counties because the pay is better.  We need to continue to increase teacher salaries to keep our amazing Harford County Teachers.  We need to grow our law enforcement in the county to help combat the issues with the Opioid Crisis. Sheriff Gahler and his team have done an amazing job keeping our county safe, but with more funding they could do more to ensure safety for everyone.   We also have a lot of aging school facilities and we need to work to update them to be safer and more up to date for our youth.","In some cases yes, in others no. Harford County is a great mix of thriving communities and agricultural land; we need to keep it that way.  I was born and raised in Harford County and have always appreciated its agricultural heritage.  Development and growth are good for the county but we have to be proactive about land use instead of reactive and we need to make sure when Community Input meetings are held that the community input is taken into account when making approval decisions.  I am a proponent of SMART Development.  By that I mean, we need to build in the required infrastructure prior to developing. This means creating the necessary roads and improvements to minimize impacts on traffic, safety and access to local businesses during and after development.   The county needs to look at alternative ways to keep roads open while doing construction so that building something like a roundabout does not cause undue hardship to small businesses while construction is going on.  Cecil and Baltimore Counties have done this successfully, Harford needs to follow suit.",It is sad to see the overdoses and death numbers rise.  I think awareness is important and making sure the stigma of addiction is removed – it crosses all socio-economic groups.  We need to stop the cycle of despair.  Public awareness and drug take back days need to increase and we need to do more to teach our youth about the dangers of opioids and other gateway drugs.,"Sheriff Gahler and his staff have done a fantastic job of protecting Harford County.  I will never forget the day the 2 deputies that gave the ultimate sacrifice protecting local citizens in the Abingdon Panera, as it was my twins 8th birthday.  Those men are heroes as are the men and women that put on a uniform every day to protect our county.  I think there is a very healthy relationship and one of mutual respect between the Sheriff's Office and the communities they serve. We need to continue to assess day to day the needs of our citizens and keep them safe.","The county has two paid ambulances in service and I think that it is a fantastic idea to have paid paramedics in the county. We have trained, dedicated citizens that are going to other municipalities to serve so that they can support their family by getting a salary and benefits.

Allocating resources in the amount of $1.2 million for a school resource officer in each middle school and providing funding for additional security measures in all county public schools provides an extra layer of protection for our children. The public relations, marketing materials and videos promoting Harford County are consistently released to the public.  The deterioration and devaluation of the Rt.40 Corridor didn't start under the current administration and it hasn't improved under the current administration.  The Rt. 40 corridor is a major commercial area located within the development envelope. The redevelopment of the corridor is vital to future economic and business growth in Harford County. To spur interest and investment in the redevelopment of the Rt. 40 corridor the public sector (government) will need to have vision, flexibility and creative incentive packages.  Tourism/Hotel Occupancy Tax – Harford County Bill No. 14-035 - Revise the current legislation to redefine or eliminate the ""tourism and/or tourism related activities"" as a qualifier for the Hotel Occupancy Tax Bill. Transparency is needed to track all of the revenue collected including the portion not awarded to non-profits and municipalities. Ensure the communities located outside of the municipalities receive a dedicated percentage of the hotel tax collected in their respective areas to be used towards community and economic development improvement projects. Support a designated percentage of the hotel tax to be annually allocated to the Visit Harford organization.","Yes, Harford County has adequate resources to meet the needs of funding public schools and law enforcement.  The goal should be to utilize the resources effectively and responsibly while increasing the tax base through economic development and smart growth. As the overall tax base increases the resources available for public schools, law enforcement, county employees, road improvements, snow removal and other public services increases.","Over the past three years, Harford County has experienced very little growth in terms of redevelopment and new development projects.  Business attraction and retention have been stagnant in Harford County as two big economic development and employment deals went to a neighboring county.; Lidl, a German supermarket chain and an Amazon distribution center both located in Cecil County.  Additionally, Medline Industries is moving from its current location in Harford County to Principio Business Park in Cecil County nearly tripling the company's workforce and adding 200 new jobs.  The Proposed Fiscal Year 2019 Operating Budget has record-level funding of $22 million from revenue dedicated to preserving agricultural land.

However, local mental health resources are still inadequate. We also need to be concerned that Glassman was very quickly able to find $1.5 million in the budget for SRO officers to be placed in our schools, but has underfunded teacher's salaries in Harford County year after year.","Harford County has consistently declined to fully fund public education, which has led to stagnant salaries, causing some of our best and most experienced teachers to leave for other counties. I know from my own experience that children with special needs are falling through cracks. Meanwhile, all children would benefit from smaller classroom sizes, experienced, well-trained and respected teachers,  and programs to meet a variety of needs.","I am concerned that development and zoning changes have occured haphazardly, without input from the people in the communities and farm families affected by growth.  Current land use policy has already created traffic issues and has done little to spread resources equitably throughout all parts of Harford County.","The county has been very active in fighting the opiod epidemic from a law enforcement perspective. However, we are severely lacking in mental health care resources, as well as support for families struggling with mental health and other related issues, such as disability. In particular, there is a dearth of  pediatric psychiatrists and therapists, and the few practices available locally often do not take health insurance, causing families to have a difficult time obtaining regular, consistent care.","I believe there is generally a positive relationship between the Harford County Sheriff's Office and the communities it serves.

The greatest failing would be the 2015 reorganization of the Office of Economic Development (not including the privatization of tourism which I support)  which included a   "" modern day approach"" to economic development by moving to rented  co-working space on Route 40 under the auspices of providing low cost space to  business start ups and County economic development professionals in a shared collaborative setting. The  approximate 12,000 square foot of space has been largely under utilized since this time and the office has just reorganized for a second time in 4 years.","There are currently not enough resources being allocated since MSDE reports an approximate 2 million shortfall annually in funding in recent years. Most importantly instructional salaries still lag behind comparable counties and we must bring those salaries up to a competitive level.  There remains a critical need for improvement in closing education gaps, expanding programs and services.   I would also like to see more support in schools for guidance counselors and the responsible use of technology and social media. The new program A Peaceful Alternative and peer to peer support groups are  a great step forward here.  I am an advocate for restorative programs to promote more community responsibility in our students. There is also a need for more vocational training and I would  support measures to build another technical school since there is a growing need for trade skills in our society.   More before and after care offered through the schools is a need in throughout the school system but particularly in District F.    I will also be a strong advocate for maintaining funding for music and drama programs. The move to fund school resource officers is a positive first step forward but additional funds will need to be identified to  adequately safe-guard ALL of our schools. This is a costly but necessary measure.","We need to continue to strive toward smart growth. There is a planned area in the County for development with public water and sewerage called the Development Envelope. This is a good concept and works to keep more intense housing and commercial zoning in designated areas while also helping to keep the rural character of the county intact. The 2016 Annual Growth Report shows Harford's current Development Envelope has enough empty land to build 16,953 new dwelling units (houses, apartments, etc.).  Up-zoning properties outside the Development Envelope hurts restoration and possible revitalization of existing, older areas as it is cheaper to build ""new"" on farmland rather than to renovate or replace existing buildings. In the 2017 CZR there is a combined potential loss of 168 acres of agricultural zoned property outside the Development Envelope.  We need to be mindful of the delicate balance between growth and quality of life remains an ongoing effort.","I am pleased with measures taken in the FY 19 budget to increase funding to the Mobile Crisis Team but we have a long way to go on this issue. We need to look at more intervention and support programs being available for people before they turn to opioids.  The County suffers from a lack of mental health providers for children. Many of the issues that cause people to turn to drugs could have been addressed through counseling or better coping abilities that can be taught when issues are identified in time. Every effort should be made to retain or attract more resources, especially physician providers to this area since teen depression, addiction, and suicide continues to be on the rise.","I would characterize this relationship as a work in progress like most communities across the country. Policing in this country has changed dramatically on a national scale over recent years and the narrative of abuse and racial intolerance vs. a growing disrespect for law enforcement  has and will definitely impact suburban communities like Harford County that serve such diverse populations.  The police -community relationship should begin early in the school system so that a trust between one another can be established and built on upon a neutral common ground. Like mutual respect in any relationship it (Respect) has to be earned over time. Adding trained school resource officers in all schools at the elementary level will go along way to improve this relationship. Sensitivity training should be taught to  law enforcement officers in regards to their communities. In turn, children should be taught that police officers and other people of authority should receive respect and to respond otherwise can be perceived as an act of aggression and can unnecessarily escalate situations.  As a daughter of a career law enforcement professional, I would like to foster this greater understanding so that all communities in Harford County can move forward together.","It is my understanding that the program currently in place is to supplement the volunteer efforts of our local fire companies and emergency medical services. Due to the increasing population call volume has increased which is requiring more services from volunteer personnel. I support this measure in its intent to ""test an idea"" and plan for the future sustainability of emergency response/care for County citizens.  The administration should strive for open lines of communication between these volunteer service providers to ensure that efforts are complimentary to what is being provided and not redundant as they test the effectiveness  of this  pilot program. Hopefully the new Emergency Medical Services Standards Advisory board  can establish performance measurements and evaluate  the cost effectiveness through data collection program while building upon the proud heritage and hard work  of our volunteer fire fighter and EMS community.",What do you consider the greatest accomplishments and failings of the Glassman administration?,"Does Harford County have adequate resources to meet its needs, particularly in the funding of public schools and law enforcement?",Have the county’s land use policies adequately balanced growth and the preservation of existing communities and agricultural land?,"How do you rate the county’s efforts to fight opioid addiction overdoses?

But there needs to be a stronger commitment from local government to both listen to and adequately resource the teachers and staff in our public schools.  Under Mr. Glassman, Harford has retained its agricultural heritage and rural areas , which is an aspect very many of us enjoy and appreciate  - open fields, farmers' markets, and walking trails.  I believe we need stronger leadership in planning for and ensuring a healthy, sustainable environment in the decades to come, to include strong protections for our streams, air,  and open spaces,  as well as growing ""green"" jobs in Harford that will help both the environment and the economy.","If we make schools and law enforcement priorities, I am certain we can resource them adequately.  Harford is fiscally sound, but where we direct funds depends on what citizens and their representatives in government feel are the most important issues to address.  The county could do a better job of including public comment to bills, including the budget, before they are voted on.  Notice of council and budget meetings could be better advertised to allow more interested residents to attend.","Agricultural preservation has local support, and the development envelope has been the designated ""growth zone"" for decades.  However, the county does not do an adequate job of giving notice of proposed development to allow public comments.  HarfordNEXT is a good step toward providing a way for residents to comment on future plans on a variety of topics, including development and open space, but it has not yet proven to be effective in influencing decisions and has not generated as much input as anticipated.  The county needs to offer residents more ways to be part of the process and create more interest in giving input to the policies and planning that will shape Harford's future for generations.","The opioid epidemic is a complex issue that all too many communities face today and needs health care experts to help provide solutions.  Addiction requires treatment, so every overdose incident should be followed up to ensure treatment, family counseling, and long-term monitoring are provided.  To be truly effective, rehabilitation needs to address not just addiction but related issues that could lead to relapse.  Suing drug manufacturers as a county may or may not be an effective tactic, but it will not address the current crisis.  We need education at all levels, in school and in the community, to recognize addiction and how to seek help for oneself and for others.  We also need health care providers to offer options for pain management other than opioids, including medical marijuana.","The Sheriff's Office has a good relationship with Harford communities in that their personnel are trusted to offer professional and timely service to residents in need.  Collective bargaining is long overdue, and that change will help to attract and retain highly professional deputies.","I have not followed the administration's proposal closely so will not give an opinion on this subject.

We need to work with the State and Federal government to increase the funding.  1. School safety is of utmost importance.  We need a trained person, Security Resource Officer (not the teachers) at every school or group of schools. We need cameras installed. We need a lock down system/practice drills in place if the need would ever arise. We may need to re-structure some of the open classroom schools for more security.  All of this is costly and needs to be properly budgeted.  Other sources of funding need to be investigated as well.  2. Besides school safety, I'd like to see increase funding for technology in our schools - use of the interactive ""blackboard"" in every classroom, laptops for the students to take to and from school for homework, increase communication between students and teachers. 3. I'd like to see increase funding for special programs and extra-curricula activities (sports/clubs/drama/music) , one in particular, is the ""middle college"" where high school students can take college courses and earn college credit at Harford Community College.","Yes, but we need to keep planning for the future.  We have just passed a new Master Plan that will help lead us with future growth.  The Harford Land Trust and State preservation programs help with land preservation of farms and large acreages of property.  But we need to be ready for future growth and not let it happen haphazardly. I think the millennial generation is ready to move out from their parents homes and basements.  They will be looking for affordable housing.  They will need townhomes, condominiums, apartments, and/or starter homes.  We want to provide them a place to live and raise their families in our County.  We need to help the builders/developers create the housing opportunities.  Lower the permitting fees, so that the costs are not passed through to the consumer.","We need to do more!!  We need to fight and destroy this epidemic.  It's killing our people.  We need to stop the supply and demand of the business - 1. catch and prosecute the drug distributions, create the laws to prosecute them for MURDER, strict sentencing for years (not catch and release) that will deter the gangs from coming into this county. But this is a statewide, national wide problem - we need to work with other jurisdictions too! 2. We need to work on the rehabilitation and treatment programs. Help fund them. Try to help the people get off the addiction. 3. Try to help people before they would ever start the drugs. I think this is a spiritual/psychological matter.

Harford County is a leader in the country for land preservation programs; to date, Harford County has protected over 50,000 acres.  I was proud to have championed the expansion of the Maryland Rural Legacy Program and Priority Preservation Area (PPA) boundaries to include the ""Upper"" Deer Creek Watershed.  During my first term, I was instrumental in creating legislation that strengthened our County's already renowned land preservation easement program to encourage greater participation from prospective landowners.   Most recently, I was an advocate for the newly adopted land preservation incentive areas (productive farmland nearest to our designed growth areas under the greatest development pressure).  I look forward to working with the Administration to develop innovative ways to continue to balance growth, protect the character of our rural and village communities, and enhance the quality of life for all residents of Harford County.","Harford County is a leader in the State and the Country in pioneering initiatives to fight the opiate epidemic including award-winning awareness campaigns, arts programs, peer to peer messaging, peer recovery coaches, agency partnerships, and an outstanding prevention team- the Harford County Office of Drug Control Policy.  In 2017 the Office leveraged the County's investment of $250,000 into more than a $1 million dollars for treatment and recovery. We are also fortunate to have ACR, a nonprofit organization that offers 24/7 support for individuals seeking treatment, in our County. Harford County Government and its partners (Harford County Sheriff's Office, schools, hospitals, health department, Court System, CORE, etc.) have done a tremendous job raising awareness about the epidemic and are working daily to reduce the barriers to treatment and recovery. Moving forward, we must continue to work together to address gaps in our communities. We need treatment beds for youth, mental health interventions for middle and elementary school children, transitional/recovery housing, teen diversion and re-entry programs, and resources to support long-term sobriety. Further, we need to partner with the defense community to protect our first responders, and find more effective ways to detect fentanyl.","The Harford County Sheriff's Office has an excellent Community Policing Team which includes School Resource Officers in high schools and soon middle schools. The School SROs are trusted confidants for students and dedicated public servants. The HOPE Group, HOPE Trailer, and participation at events like Project Homeless Connect, Drug Take Back Events, and School Resource Fairs are well attended by all of our partners in law enforcement and I commend them for making community outreach a high priority. I support increasing positive interaction opportunities like these.","Harford County is fortunate to have exceptional volunteer fire and emergency medical services which play a critical role in protecting our community. I strongly support our first responders and I am grateful for their service. They have a difficult and dangerous job to do. I am an advocate for funding necessary renovations, protective gear, and efforts to improve the quality of life of our volunteer first responders.",What do you consider the greatest accomplishments and failings of the Glassman administration?,"Does Harford County have adequate resources to meet its needs, particularly in the funding of public schools and law enforcement?",Have the county’s land use policies adequately balanced growth and the preservation of existing communities and agricultural land?,"How do you rate the county’s efforts to fight opioid addiction overdoses?

This current administration continues to be a strong advocate for public safety and our school system. This can be seen by the new Havre de Grace Middle/High School project and fencing off new revenue for special needs buses and technology for Harford County Public Schools. More recently, an additional $1.3 Million funding for additional School Resource Officers (SROs) has been announced for the FY19 Budget.  While the Glassman Administration continues to be fiscally responsible, in my opinion we have missed opportunities to reinvest and revitalize the Route 40 Corridor.","I'm proud to be a member of the current County Council which has approved the past three budgets of the Glassman Administration. These budgets have taken steps to correct the pay scales for our teachers and law enforcement. After being flat funded for 6-7 years, 85% of all new revenue and savings has gone for salary increases for our teachers, deputies and county workers.  Harford County has always met the Maintenance of Effort for our students but for the past 3 years, we have gone over and above. Along with this effort the county has been able to provide for funding for special needs buses and technology upgrades for our public schools, and more recently announced the funding for School Resource Officers in all middle schools across the county.","The purpose of Harford NEXT (Master Plan) was to address those concerns and needs while planning for smart growth and address areas such as mobility, rural communities, environmental stewardship, walking trails, and commercial development.  The Master Plan directs growth along our corridors where the infrastructure exists or can be enhanced while also allowing for open space and agricultural preservation. Harford County is within the top 10 nationally for agricultural land preservation with over 50,000 acres across the county preserved.","In Harford County we have many community partners and professionals working with the Glassman administration to combat the issue of opioid and heroin use from all angles and I remain dedicated to assist them in any way that I can. Among other tools, Harford County Health Department and the Office of Drug Control Policy are working to provide our citizens with education and prevention measures. Along with public outreach efforts, these departments have received approximately $500,000 in various funding to establish a crisis center equipped with overnight beds to assist residents of Harford County in fighting this epidemic.","I believe by the Harford County Sheriff's Office holding Public Outreach forums such as the Town Hall for School Public Safety and working with various groups and organizations is beneficial to our community and shows a positive relationship with the public. It works well when our County Executive, Sheriff, Municipal Law Enforcement agencies and School Superintendent and Community Leaders come together to answer questions and address concerns the public may have.","We appreciate the service our volunteers provide us each and every day. Any given night, they can be awakened at 2:00AM or 3:00AM to respond to the needs of our citizens. A great number of our volunteers have served Harford County for many years and they are aging.  In order to attract younger volunteers, we need to do more to assist our fire companies in their recruitment and retention efforts.  My understanding of the new County Medic units is that they exist to assist our volunteer companies in responding to the high call volumes they are receiving, especially during the work hours. In no way will this replace our volunteer service. Without our volunteers, the citizens of Harford County would need nearly $80 Million per year to fund a paid Fire and EMS service.",What do you consider the greatest accomplishments and failings of the Glassman administration?,"Does Harford County have adequate resources to meet its needs, particularly in the funding of public schools and law enforcement?",Have the county’s land use policies adequately balanced growth and the preservation of existing communities and agricultural land?,"How do you rate the county’s efforts to fight opioid addiction overdoses?

Our triple A bond rating has continued.  While well-intentioned, I do not believe the county's outsourcing efforts have actually realized the cost savings that were anticipated.   As prescribed by the charter, there needs to be a check and balance system between the legislative and executive branch.  The council has relinquished some of the needed authority to accomplish this.  Credit and blame are due both branches for accomplishments and failures. We, the citizens of the county achieve a better ""end product"" when the county government works as the charter called for.","Presently, I believe the county does have adequate resources to achieve meeting the needs of our public schools and law enforcement.  Future needs will require more manpower and funding as our population grows and needs increase and change.  Our drug and crime issues will demand more officers and correctional employees.  School funding will need more money to maintain a safe environment for our children.","Overall, our land use policies are balanced with preservation of existing communities and agricultural land.  The comprehensive land use plan sets the guidelines for this balance in our vision for the future.  I believe we can do better if we take a more extensive view of how we would like the county to grow and learn from our mistakes of the past. I have seen too many times, what was planned and approved takes on a whole new look upon completion. There were some issues in the past comprehensive review that I was not in agreement with, that were in contrast with the balance between existing communities and ag land usages. I would look forward to discussions of longer range planning and creating an environment here that provides job opportunities and a county that our children and grandchildren might want to continue to live and call ""home"".",I feel the Sheriff and County Executive have done a commendable job of addressing the opioid crisis.  This epidemic exploded much faster than anyone could have predicted and was prepared for.  Education and the revisiting of mental health and addiction programs will be needed to keep pace with the rising needs of our population that is affected by this.,"The Sheriff  and his office have done an excellent job addressing the community issues, being involved with various communities and identifying problem areas and taking appropriate action.   Presently, I am satisfied with the superior work that is being performed by this office.","This issue has been on and off the table for discussion for more than 25 years.  The volunteer service we enjoy has always performed an extraordinary job for Harford County throughout the years and continues to do so.  The expenses associated with any transformation to a more ""professional service"" will be astronomical.   Throughout the discussion and planning phases of this concept, I would have liked more transparency and public involvement. The growth in our county, the lack of available time people have for education and to volunteer for fire and emergency medical service are no doubt factors that make us look at options.  Transitioning will not be easy and it will become evident very quickly how much Harford County has been blessed over the years to have enjoyed the excellent volunteer service of our citizens who have provided these services for us all.
