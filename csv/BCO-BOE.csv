I will bring the same innovative spirit to the Board, as I did as the chief public health official of Howard County and Baltimore City, where I initiated programs that produced very positive outcomes for children.   There is no question that Baltimore County schools are underfunded.  In recent years, additional stresses have been placed on the system—from increased Title 1 and Special Education populations, to an increase in the number of students coming to school with significant behavioral problems and socioeconomic needs which make them less prepared to learn.    To address these needs, additional resources need to be obtained.  My top priority for additional funding is to hire more teachers and professional staff to allow for both smaller class sizes and more manageable classrooms.  I would then budget additional funding to increase and improve services to our most vulnerable populations—by increasing the number of Community Schools in areas of concentrated poverty and implementing universal pre-K, to improve the chances of better educational outcomes for youngsters who may not have had the exposure to enriching activities prior to school as others.","Because of the illegitimate manner in which the contract for laptops was awarded, I would like to evaluate how  much they should have cost with an appropriate process before coming to a conclusion on cost.   Nonetheless, I think more advanced technology is beneficial to our students, but computers alone are not adequate, if large class sizes are allowed to persist in Baltimore County schools.  Therefore, I support a balanced approach to school funding—modernize yes, but also provide funds for more teachers (to reduce class size) and for social workers/school psychologists/counselors as well as professional pupil worker staff to handle disciplinary and behavioral problems (to allow teachers to have more manageable classrooms).","No--I Think the system's resources are not equitably divided.  Schools in lower income areas are not  in as good shape as those in  higher income areas.  In order to address these  inequities, a truly transparent and unbiased assessment process must be implemented to determine the needs of individual schools.","-        Require the Superintendent to present all major budgetary or programmatic changes to the entire school board 
-        As a Board member, pledge to go through the entire budget with a fine-tooth comb 
-        As a Board member, maintain a healthy skepticism of highly touted new initiatives when voting on them 
-        Prohibit no-bid contracts valued at greater than $10,000  The interim superintendent's disclosure failures are not anywhere as egregious as Dallas Dance's.  However, I have had to file these types of disclosures as a public official for twenty years, and when I had any doubts about a disclosure, I personally called the appropriate ethics office to ascertain the correct way to do so.  In light  of the recent history at BCPS, it was incumbent  on Ms. White to go the extra mile to make sure  her financial disclosure form was pristine.   ","The system's rules are probably sufficient.   However, the rules have to be enforced, financial disclosures have to be examined for veracity and the Board of Education has to do a better job of holding high level  BCPS officials accountable.","As long as they are enforced equitably, most of the  policies are fairly reasonable.  I do think their need to be stronger forms of discipline for bullying, because the long-term consequences of chronic bullying are very damaging psychologically.  However, I think we need to intervene with students who are troubled before they act out.  To that end, I support increased funding for professional counseling staff in each school to work with students with behavioral/disciplinary issues outside of the classroom.  This has the additional benefit of allowing for more manageable classrooms.","As a dad (and a former  middle school teacher) who frequently answers questions from my 6th grader regarding his homework, I quickly concluded that I didn't particularly like  or understand the Common Core.  I think an effort needs to be made to evaluate whether it  has made any difference in our children's knowledge base.  I think that each jurisdiction in Maryland has its own challenges and strengths that impact their respective school systems.  Thus, teachers should be evaluated on metrics that are informed by the population of students to be served.  This approach, therefore, argues against a single ""cookie-cutter"" state-imposed evaluation process.   Having seen my two youngest children spend so much time taking standardized tests and their teachers teaching to these tests, I have been struck by how poorly this captures a teacher's abilities, or a student's true aptitude for that matter.  As a public health professional, I strongly support evidence-based policies.  Such an approach is necessary in creating constructive evaluation systems, which have to be developed with significant teacher input, and reduce the excessive use of standardized testing.","School attendance zones should include diversity as a component of zoning decisions, but zones should be as compact as feasible.

There is no more important mission in this world than educating, nurturing, and preparing our young people so they can fulfill their potential and lead our neighborhoods, county, and country to a safer, more equitable, and prosperous future.   It is because of my family's commitment to public education and community service that I applied to be on BOE.    Governor Hogan appointed me to BOE in July 2015.  We have made progress.  However there is much work to be done, especially since the Board has recently learned of chronic misconduct of the former Superintendent and other BCPS staff. My experience will be crucial given possible turnover of the entire BOE.  Additional transitions include Superintendent, County Executive and  County Council. I have gained needed institutional knowledge. I know how things work and how things don't work, how they can break down and fail to optimally serve our students, families, and faculty. I know the effort, knowledge, and courage it takes to serve. I didn't have many allies, for example, when I voted against  2016 re-appointment of previous superintendent. The same goes when I voted against his lavish contract. I have recent graduates and current student in BCPS. I strive to make principled decisions at the right time for the right reasons, regardless of detractors and pressure. Stakeholders can be confident  I  exercise my independence to do what is right and just for students.","I believe that developmentally appropriate, equitable, financially-sustainable and effective implementation of technology is beneficial for teaching and learning. However, I am not convinced that hurtling rapidly down the current path directed by our former superintendent is in the best interest of our students, teachers, staff and communities. The teachers clearly need laptops to effectively leverage the increasingly digital classroom management, grading, communication, instruction materials and tools.  However, BCPS has been implementing a massive experiment in digital instruction with disruption to programs of education, students, teachers, staff and parents.  Even as schools adapt over the years to STAT (Students and Teachers Accessing Tomorrow), academic achievement is only slowly ticking up, while in some cases PARCC scores have declined.   It is necessary to completely evaluate all aspects of STAT initiative: curriculum, teacher workload and workflow, and ""budget re-alignment"" including the level of spending in each area: devices (laptop), technology, marketing, utilization, professional development and travel of administrative personnel.  See how we can provide benefits needed in more cost effective way, to allocate more of budget to teachers and in-school support positions and salary.   We have spent about $260 MILLION in first years of STAT initiative,  while there are schools with basic needs unmet: clean water, working HVAC, overcrowding, aging schools, insufficient support staff, transportation issues.  If BOE was more effective, BCPS would not spend more than double what is recommended for student and teacher laptops. Increasing research suggests negative impacts of inappropriate screentime: student data privacy, behavior, Health, and vision issues.  http://one-to-oneinstitute.org/images/remository/Finance_Brief.pdf","There have been efforts to improve fair and equitable resources among schools.  But I think a thorough examination is in order.  While Title 1 schools have additional resources, in general other schools with large populations of needy students may not.  I think we need additional resources to support minority, low-income students and other student populations, ESOL, Special Education that need specific interventions for students to achieve their potential.  Needed Resources include: more teachers for smaller class sizes, and support personnel: social workers, counselors, PPW, ESOL teachers, Special Ed teachers and paraeducators, nurses, certified behavior therapists,  other student supports.  It is a matter of budget priority, with much going to STAT that may be more successfully applied to direct student supports.  Also, I support local efforts to create and support community schools in areas of concentrated poverty.  In visiting schools and communities throughout Baltimore County, it is evident some need more support for students from socioeconomic struggling circumstances.  It is a win-win for students and the wider county, state and nation. Each student that has academic success and graduates is better able to live a happy life and support themselves, which is ultimately better for the wider community.","See the answers to # 11.  My experience and institutional knowledge will be crucial, with few returning members. I know effort and courage it takes to serve. I have seen how things work and how things don't work. Proper Superintendent Oversight. Engage with all BOE members to become highly effective governing Board. Return the Board of Education to its proper role of governance and oversight.  The Board should revaluate policies and procedures that have weakened the Board's accountability, transparency and effectiveness in providing the highest quality education to each student in our care. The Board should be engaged and inclusive with all stakeholders in the system: students, teachers, staff, administration, parents, families, communities, elected officials, etc.  The Board should ensure compliance with all policies and procedures so that the program of education is highly effective for all students, with the proper use of all our resources, financial and staffing.  The BOE needs to design a strong and clear contract for the next superintendent. It should contain specifics related to accountability and transparency.  There should be no outside work, no other earned income, no time spent away from the district unless pre-approved by the full Board, not just the Board Chair.  The BOE needs to operate diligently to monitor adherence to all policies and procedures related to conduct and ethics.   Mrs. V.

The current process of the Ethics Review Panel and the financial disclosure form and processes need to be improved to provide proper oversight and transparency.  As a member of the BOE Policy Review Committee I realized almost all Policy development was Superintendent administration directed with little BOE or community input.  Many policies were changed to limit the governance of the BOE.  Many need to be evaluated and updated to increase BOE accountability of BCPS.  All polices need to be evaluated, especially ethics, conflicts of interest, financial disclosure, Internal Board Operations, oversight of the Superintendent and system, and procurement.  Also, after an independent comprehensive forensic audit is completed, the BOE needs to evaluate and implement recommendations. The audit was directed by the BOE in September 2015, but through lack of leadership by BOE and BCPS it has not yet started.  Hopefully, contract will be approved in May 2018 and work started immediately.  After policies are updated the Superintendent needs to update the system's rules and procedures to align and implement them as directed by the BOE.  The BOE then needs to monitor for adherence and effectiveness.  In order to do that we need to increase staffing in our office of Internal Audit which has not kept pace with rising student enrollment, employees and budget.   BCPS has 113,282 students and 18,572 employees. The Current Operating Budget is over $1.6 BILLION Dollars.","The system's  discipline policies need improvement to effectively keep students safe, appropriately discipline students and encourage proper behavior that is conducive to teaching and learning.  A positive school climate is vital for all to do their best:  teachers, students and staff. There must be order in schools and classrooms before learning can take place.    Hiring more teachers and assistants to reduce class size will improve student behavior and  academic achievement.  Also, educational program policies need to be evaluated to see how program of instruction is affecting teacher workload and workflow.  One very impactful policy is the Grading Policy and BCPS Grading and Reporting Procedures which were and remain problematic since the rollout in August 2016.  Teachers, students, parents and administrators still report inconsistent application of the procedures.  Also, teachers, students and parents point to the ""50 is the new zero"" or Low Score is counter productive to students completing all work in a timely and accurate way. So that content Mastery is not sufficient even though a student may ""Pass"" the class.","It is appropriate and effective to provide a program of education that is rigorous and provides opportunity for students to strive for highest academic achievement.  Schools across the State in 2013-14 have implemented Maryland's College and Career-Ready Standards. Maryland was one of the first states to adopt the standards in reading/English language arts and mathematics. The Maryland State Board of Education adopted the standards in June 2010.  The Common Core State Standards initiative is a state-led effort coordinated by the National Governor's Association and the Council of Chief State School Officers. These rigorous education standards establish a set of shared goals and expectations for what students should understand and be able to do in grades K-12 in order to be prepared for success in college and the workplace. The standards are research and evidence based and internationally benchmarked. They have been voluntarily adopted by 45 states.  Maryland's College and Career-Ready Standards form the foundation for Maryland's new State curriculum framework. Hundreds of classroom educators, instructional leaders, administrators, and higher education representatives continue to assist State officials in developing the  Framework.   However, The PARCC testing results have been lackluster, such that the State Board issued waivers for school systems in using results for high Stake criteria, graduation, etc.  I would note, Massachusetts, which is high-performing state in public education, pulled out of PARCC.  With the passage of ESSA, I support a review by MSDE to see if an alternative assessment would provide accountability,  with less cost and disruption to instruction time.",Yes. It is a factor in Rule 1280 which aligns with Board Policy 1280 Boundary.,"I have aggressively advocated for equitable safe, healthy, climate-controlled and modern schools to positively impact teaching and learning environments for highest student achievement. Success is through amplifying community concerns; researching best practices; collaborating with all stakeholders, county and state leaders.  In a system as large as BCPS with increasing enrollment and aging infrastructure it is challenging to equitably set priorities for school construction and renovation.  The County and State are providing an large amount of funding, but there continue to be unmet needs. There are many needs that the County and State have to balance across all resident needs.  Also, the BOE needs to make sure we are using every dollar wisely and effectively, so that our funding partners can be encouraged we will properly use all funds provided.  In 2019, the Newly elected Board should pursue a 10 year plan Strategic Facilities Plan. The Board should work with the County Council, County Executive, and the Superintendent to develop a comprehensive and equitable facilities plan, specifically like the successful Anne Arundel County Public Schools plan.  AACPS is in their second decade of implementation.  Much time and energy has been spent by parents, schools, superintendent and staff, the Board, and both county and state elected officials on the concerns of equitable and timely distribution of capital construction funds and priorities, and the negative sense that communities need to advocate against each other for those precious funds.",Why do you want to serve on the county school board?,Has the county’s use of educational technology in the classroom been appropriate?

I know that our school system can be exceptional. Up until now, however, I am convinced that our system has failed to live up to its fullest potential.  Our system has the resources to be literally world class, yet it seems as if there has been a general desire to just be 'good enough.'    I wish to serve because the School Board has failed to provide necessary oversight in the past and must improve in this area.  With my knowledge, experience, and commitment to education, I can help provide that necessary oversight.   I wish to serve to represent an under-served segment of our school population – our most talented and exceptional students in both science and the arts. I want to make sure we are providing the resources and the opportunities to enable these students to maximize their talents.   I wish to serve because children are the future and their education is a critical societal responsibility. As a citizen of this community, I want to share my insights in making the important educational decisions that will literally affect the very future of our community and country.","If you consider the STAT (Students and Teachers Accessing Tomorrow) initiative most broadly, I believe in blended learning. I do not, however, believe that providing 133,000 laptops to all students and teachers is necessary to provide quality education to our children. More specifically, I believe that the money to purchase these laptops could be much more effectively allocated.   Based upon my experience, there are three essential elements in providing quality education: an engaged learner, a competent teacher, and supportive parents (care givers). Every other educational initiative is secondary to this critical formula.   I know that children learn in many different ways and that the more teachers utilize a variety of teaching styles and techniques, the more successful the students will be. I support, therefore, integrating online digital media with traditional classroom methods.   My concern is that if all students were given laptops, there would be extreme pressure on teachers to use this technology. To justify the expense of providing laptops, teachers will actively seek activities and exercises that use laptops – for the primary purpose of using technology, rather than determining what is the best method to support the specific learning objectives.  The BCPS administration has not offered convincing arguments that proving laptops for all will improve the quality of the learning environment. They offered anecdotal stories of improved education using technology but provided no objective, causal and verifiable evidence to justify equipping all with laptops.","BCPS has a responsibility to fairly allocate resources across the entire spectrum of the student population. A fair allocation, however, does not mean an equal allocation of resources to each student.   Clearly some students need additional resources and within our abilities, BCPS should attempt to address these needs. But, these special needs should not be addressed without considering the potential harm that may be created by denial of resources to other students. I am concerned that in prioritizing resources to address the needs of the minority and low-income population, we overlook the need to provide additional resources to support the rest of the student community.  Contrary to the current prioritization, I want our schools to provide greater resources to those students who have the potential to be exceptional. We need to identify these students and give them the resources and encouragement to excel. Carver Center for the Arts has done a superb job of supporting our students in the arts. We have an equal responsibility to provide comparable resources dedicated to academic excellence in both the social sciences and STEM.    One idea I offer to support this segment is to establish Genius Grants for our exceptional students. This program, designed for high school students, will combine elements of both the MacArthur Fellowship Program and entrepreneurial start-up grants. Talented students with exceptional potential (in both science and humanities/art) would be eligible to receive monies to further develop their ideas. I would seek partnerships with local firms to fund these grants.","Since there are two current criminal issues involving BCPS officials and contracts, it is apparent that there has been inadequate Board oversight in the past. I believe there needs to be an independent audit of BCPA to bring complete transparency to Board activities. This independent audit will enable the Board to start anew with a fresh slate.   The solution to effective oversight is the open election of Board members. With open elections, Board members will be held accountable for their actions and decisions. It is also essential that the Board conduct itself with even greater transparency.  I am not prepared to say that the disclosure failures of Dallas Dance and interim Superintendent Verletta White are the same. However, I am very troubled that Superintendent White did not disclose her income as a consultant to vendors. The reason she provided for her failure to appropriately disclose was that the financial form was confusing.   These forms may indeed be confusing. But if BCPS is paying someone $250,000 a year, I want someone who is capable of navigating even confusing forms. And, if she was honestly confused, BCPS legal staff is located about 200 yards from her office. A brief walk and a five minute conversation with a BCPS attorney would have cleared up any confusion. Even if this was an innocent mistake as she claims, I am disappointed that she did not take the financial disclosure seriously enough to be overly cautious and completely transparent in completing the form.","The very fact that there are two current criminal issues involving BCPS officials and contracts and that interim Superintendent White failed to completely disclose income, makes it apparent that there has been inadequate Board oversight in the past. Therefore, the system's current rules on ethics, conflicts of interest and financial disclosure has been shown to be deficient.  However, before enacting onerous new regulations, I would first focus on creating and maintaining complete transparency. To support this required transparency, I propose two immediate actions.   First, the Board needs to assume a more proactive role in including the community at large in the conversation regarding BCPS initiatives and priorities. I want the Board to sponsor monthly town halls throughout the county to increase transparency and improve the general public's access to information regarding school matters. I would require Board members to each attend at least four of these town halls over the school year.   Second, BCPS needs to establish an ombudsman position. This person will field and address issues and questions from the entire community and will allow citizens greater access to the inner workings of the school system. I do not think this needs to be a new hire. I am confident that we can transition a current administrator into this new position.","As mentioned above, I believe the critical formula for quality education includes three essential elements: an engaged learner, a competent teacher, and supportive parents (care givers). If any student, through disruptive behavior negatively impacts the ability of others who wish to learn, we need to remove that student from the classroom to support the students who want to learn.    I also believe that BCPS should not give up on disruptive students and should provide resource and assistance to troubled students to help them understand the importance of receiving a good education. The school should utilize all their resources to help students understand the need for acceptable classroom behavior and to accept their responsibilities as a member of the school community.   BCPS needs also to make an important distinction between an infrequent discipline issue and a perpetual discipline offender. Persistent disruptive students are also citizens of this county, and as such, addressing troubled students is not just a BCPS concern. Since any disruptive student is also a member of our community, I support a stronger partnership between BCPS and other county resources to address this issue.","Conceptually I understand the reasoning for some objective assessment of student performance / capabilities. And PARCC exams address assessments in the critical areas of English Language Arts/Literacy and Mathematics.  I agree that these assessments provide a snapshot that indicates if our students are acquiring skills and knowledge needed to advance to the next grade level or if they are on track to graduate and be prepared for college and careers.  But, based upon my understanding of PARCC, it provides neither detailed strategies nor specific tactics to improve the transfer of knowledge. If BCPS is doing a quality job of educating our children, then PARCC would not needed. And, if BCPS is not adequately educating our children, PARCC does not provide a road map for improvement. Therefore, I would continue PARCC, but use the results as only one indicator of educational progress but not as a remedy.  I have a similar concern with Common Core. Common Core standards have now been around nearly a decade. If they are useful, then I would expect to see yearly improvement in student performance. If we do not see yearly improvement, it is a fair question to ask just how valuable are these standards. More plainly, I am confident that a highly competent math or English teacher can teach essential math / English skills to an engaged student without the need to refer to Common Core.   Common Core and PARCC are potentially useful tools, but tools only and not the Holy Grail of education.",Diversity can be a consideration in drawing new school attendance zone lines but should not be the over-arching factor in the decisions. It would be inappropriate to create gerrymandered zones to satisfy a diversity requirement. I believe in the general concept that a child should attend the most local school.   We do not want to create islands of disparity in educational opportunities. We need to provide all of our schools with the resources and competent staff to provide quality educational opportunities. I reject the argument that disadvantaged students need to transfer to non-local schools in order to receive a quality education.,"The BCPS Board has a responsibility to provide a safe and secure infrastructure in which to educate our children. Decisions on allocating resources to facilities should be prioritized first to address any outstanding safety issues.   Any long-term infrastructure issues should be addressed with a long-term perspective of anticipated demographic changes and not just to address a short-term situation. I also believe that parents should be brought into the discussion of resource allocation since their children are directly involved.   While comfortable buildings support educational efforts, they are not the primary driver of quality education. Currently, as an outsider, I do not have a complete understanding of how and why resources have been allocated. Even within a 350 page BCPS budget, there is a surprising lack of specificity on how resources are allocated and the reasons for these decisions. My experience with budgets convinces me that within a $ 1.6 billion budget there exists opportunities to re-allocate budget dollars to meet essential needs.",Why do you want to serve on the county school board?,Has the county’s use of educational technology in the classroom been appropriate?

It seemed every day I was reading a story in the news about ethical violations or some other problem. All of those problems could have stopped by the existing board members.  If elected, I hope to bring some common sense to the board.   Plus, I feel that I am uniquely qualified to be on the board and represent the people of our district. Specifically, I currently hold four roles that will help me if elected to the board: 1) Parent of two children in the BCPS system so have a vested interest in how the board of ed operates; 2) Teacher - provides me insight into the challenges of education; 3) Professor - serve on numerous committees and know how to work as a team; and 4) Scientist -can analyze and review the research to make informed decisions.","The county made a huge bet on the personal computers and is refuses to accept the fact that it is not the panacea that they were hoping.  Remember, the whole deal was struck because of our former superintendent -- who is headed for jail for corruption. The fact that they are continuing the program in its current form is sad for the taxpayers of Baltimore County.   The evidence just isn't there and too many tax dollars are being wasted to fund unproven methods. I would redirect monies to reduce class sizes which has strong research support and provide more support in existing classrooms to help teachers.","Based on the actions of the previous and current superintendent, I think the answer is yes. Obviously, I would need to further investigate to see if there are any discrepancies as I'm more familiar with my local schools, but I think Dr. Dance's primary focus, in particular, was to close any gap in resource allocation.  As for adequate support, more has to be done to help students - and parents- in those schools to succeed.","The fact that representatives in Baltimore found it necessary to investigate ethical violations and to propose a rule preventing current superintendents from having additional employment should say it all. The current board has done nothing to reign in the corruption and all of the problems, all of the ethical violations, all of the lost trust, and all of the bad press, is directly attributable to the current members of the board.  The only distinction I see between Dr. Dance's actions and Ms. Whites, are the extent.","Apparently not. If the current superintendent, who's boss was just convicted of corruption, did the same thing and stated that she didn't know and just made a mistake, then I'd say that changes need to be made. The fact that Baltimore County senators and representatives need to intervene to stop the corruptive practices should also tell us that the rules aren't sufficient.","I would need to look more into the disciplinary issues across the district to see what challenges exist. As for any fixes, I would look at what other school districts do - what works and what doesn't and make sound decisions based on science and reported outcomes.",I believe that there is too much standardized testing in our schools and too many resources are devoted to the testing- both time and money.  The common core takes away flexibility from the teachers and individual schools and the ability to individualize instruction.  Teachers are the best equipped to evaluate students' performance and they need to be given the time to do what they are best at-- teach. Not administer standardized tests which may even accurately reflect the students' true abilities.,"Definitely, yes. A one-sized approach to attendance does not fit all the schools in our county and each school, each area should be allowed to come up with their own approach and solution.","Obviously, updates need to be made. For any of our kids to have school cancelled because a few schools don't have air conditioning and its too hot, that's an embarrassment.  We need to reprioritize our funding and stop wasteful spending.

Right now Baltimore County voters/citizens have a power given to them that they have not had before, the ability to hold the school system accountable. This is a time of incredible potential for change. This is the first time Baltimore County is electing a school board and they will be able to rein in wasteful spending, crumbling infrastructure, and fiscal inequality present in our county. The three main issues that concern me are Allocation, Investment, and Safety. Public education is like a three legged table upon which the school system foundation is built with the administration, the board, and the community holding equal importance to an effective school system. Removing any of those legs, or decreasing their importance makes the foundation topple. Right now we have an administration which directs the board, and seeks no community input at all. By electing me to the School Board I will work to change that providing more Community involvement, Oversight, Accountability, and Transparency. The Administration, the Board, and the community need to all work together for the benefit of the kids. It is vitally important for each to provide checks and balances on the others.",The STAT initiative is clouded with controversy. While technology is an integral part of the education process STAT is coming at the cost of adequate resources for our children. Do kids from 1st-12th grade use technology in the same way? Why would we use a one size fits all approach? Other school districts have integrated technology far more efficiently. We need to weigh the cost of the other projects that have money allocated away from them like facilities and support services. The recently approved contract is not one I would support in the fashion it arrived. In comparison to the technology that is available I feel BCPS overpaid for the devices they contracted for. The money saved going with a cheaper alternative would be very helpful in the school infrastructure category.,"I want people to be proud of Dundalk, Essex, Edgemere, and Rosedale just like I am. I have consistently seen the neglect Towson has for the East side of the county and want to advocate for equality. Our facilities need attention, we have inadequate school buildings and overcrowded classrooms. We do not have the other support in addition to teachers, like social workers, pupil personnel workers, and counselors.","Public education is like a three legged table upon which the school system foundation is built with the administration, the board, and the community holding equal importance to an effective school system.

The Administration, the Board, and the community need to all work together for the benefit of the kids. It is vitally important for each to provide checks and balances on the others. Contracts should be fully investigated and properly vetted by the board. The current way that the board has done things has led the board to lose the support of community and trust of those they are called on to represent. Transparency is one of my core tenants, the process for bidding needs to be completely open to scrutiny and not hidden from the public. An independent audit is needed to start to help restore confidence in the system. We need to be made completely aware of where our money is going. The school system is funded by the taxes that we pay. We have every right to expect that our tax dollars are being spent effectively and not being decided behind closed doors.","The rules for ethics, conflicts of interest, and financial disclosure are easily located on the BCPS website. In addition there is an Ethics Department that can be contacted for clarification.","We need to give teachers and principals enough latitude to address problems but we need to have a clear consistent across the board policy for addressing behavior. We need to make every effort to keep kids in classrooms and learning but there comes a point where to be fair to the rest of the students we have to remove that child. Some children are going to need more resources than the standard comprehensive classroom can offer. Decreasing class sizes is proven to decrease behavioral problems. Teachers can interact more with students and get to know them as individuals. These interactions paired with support services, from pupil personnel workers and social workers, will contribute greatly to identifying and handling behavioral issues.","Speaking with many educators in various schools and at all levels I agree that the Common Core standards and the PARCC exams are divesting children of the proper teaching they need. I agree with Delegate Miele who says, ""PARCC is a failed standardized test…there is no correlation to SAT's"". We need to allow teachers to reach the students in their classroom. Each and every student is a unique individual, we need to allow teachers to engage the students in the most productive way that they can, not be forced to trek to computer labs and spend inordinate amounts of time testing.","School boundaries should be drawn to take multiple things into consideration such as keeping cohorts together, increasing economic diversity, and the importance of walking to school. Using economic diversity as a factor creates rich diverse classrooms where students can learn and push each other. It enables them to interact and collaborate with kids from all walks of life.","I first got involved with schools when I found out about the insufficient renovations to Patapsco High School and Center for the Arts. I heard they were actually taking away classroom space and using trailers as permanent classrooms. Trailers – relocatables – learning cottages- no matter how you dress it up, are not permanent solutions. Overcrowding is an issue here on the east side, all three of our area high schools are over their state rated capacity. Dundalk is 110%, Patapsco is 111%, and Sparrows Point is 110%. As a school system we spend money every year to have a physical facilities rating of every school in the county. Logic says that you would go to the worst school in the report and work backwards-addressing those worst schools because they need the most attention. Unfortunately we do not do it that way in Baltimore County and that needs to change. By reining in wasteful spending we can dedicate the resources necessary to ensure our children have adequate facilities for instruction.",Why do you want to serve on the county school board?,Has the county’s use of educational technology in the classroom been appropriate?

I will put a planning strategy in place that receives input from all stakeholders. I will insist upon justice in how we provide for communities and students. I will develop a Board that strives to meet the challenges faced by all students, regardless of economic or social advantage.  And, finally, I will fight for a Board of Education whose philosophy is firmly rooted in the idea that the best solutions to educational challenges come directly from the classroom. I'm a pediatric nurse. Any nurse will tell you that the best care comes when those working with patients tell the leadership what is needed, and leadership acts swiftly and decisively to provide it.","I support the continuation of the STAT program because the teachers in the classroom have overwhelmingly supported it, it has made strides in student progress, and puts our classrooms on a 21st-century footing. There have been problems with implementation, but these have been addressed and are being addressed. One must remember that the program was extremely innovative when it first rolled out. No innovative program doesn't have bumps in the early phases.","Short answer - no.  This system has a problem in how it allocates resources. We need a more comprehensive plan for facilities and resources that is free from the political whims of the moment. We must do a better job of focusing resources toward those who come to the system with less advantage.  We seem to doll out resources based on which communities have the best advocacy groups going at the time. This is inherently inequitable, and has to change.","Dallas Dance's transgressions were his own. There clearly rose to the level that called for prosecution. He took steps to cover his wrongs and acted patently with self-interest that harmed the system. Verletta White's errors were more technical in nature, she did not attempt to cover them up, and have been fully remedied.  White's were also shown to be easily replicable. Equating White's errors to Dance's crimes only makes sense if one is trying to use the school system as a political fulcrum to lever an agenda.",These rules are sufficient but require more clarity for the user and more accessible assistance from parties not charged also with enforcement. Staff should have more guidance in completing this process which has been shown to be confusing.,"School disciplinary policies, while firmly rooted in safety, must always be educationally-focused. We must avoid programs that unequally target minorities and the disadvantage, and must look to root causes for discipline problems. BCPS should partner closely with public heal and law enforcement agencies where appropriate, and always seek innovation and best practices for school safety.","The curricula and metrics we employ should be those best suited to the situation.  We are trying, at times, to measure unique situations with common tools,  and that only produces flawed results. If we're measuring length, we should use a ruler - not a scale.","It should absolutely be, but it's not that simple. We can solve a lack of community diversity with a school boundary map. Much of the problem with school diversity started with a lack of economic and social diversity in our communities. We should work to fix that, but its outside of the BOE's ability to impact greatly. When possible, no group should be excluded from the great system I want to build -because no great system leaves people out.","The county has dedicated a great deal to this effort and is often waiting for the state to make good on projects that have been forward-funded by the county.  I would prioritize this way: 1. Safety - is the school adequate for the health and safety of our students  2. Learning environment - is the school overcrowded, ADA compliant, and does it meet the learning needs.  3. Equity - has the community served by the school suffered from a lack or equity historically. Can we better serve this community with a new or rennovated school.  Overall, I'd like to see increased funding for our schools physical needs and an increase in tempo for construction and renovation project.s",Why do you want to serve on the county school board?,Has the county’s use of educational technology in the classroom been appropriate?

I became a teacher to make a difference in the lives of kids and I hope to do the same on the Baltimore County Board of Education.","Educators clearly needed more time to prepare and plan lessons to integrate those devices into their pedagogy.  In an ideal world, I would have liked to have device carts and STAT teachers for each grade in elementary.  The STAT teacher would then be a part of the grade level team and act as co-teacher implementing devices, apps, and new techniques throughout the school year making sure to work with each class.  This plan would have negated parental concerns of screen addiction along with giving educators more time and flexibility to work out the inevitable kinks and drawbacks that come with a massive initiative.","More needs to be done for those schools with higher amounts of poverty from employing more pupil personnel workers to social workers.  The Summer meals program should also include some type of Summer engagement/enrichment program that would prevent that ""Summer slide"" of academic skills that occur from one school year to another.  Older kids could also be added into this equation by employing them as tutors and mentors for the younger kids.","Having an elected school board that's accountable to the community they serve is a great step in ensuring oversight by electing people that will be objective but not obstructive in their professional relationship with the superintendent.  Dallas Dance conned numerous people in and around BCPS and while we expect our institutions to be perfect they are still liable to the frailties of human beings.  That being said, I believe there is a distinction between interim Superintendent White's failure to disclose and the actions of Dallas Dance.  She has taken proper actions to rectify the error in judgment.  Whether or not her lack of disclosing funds was intentionally misleading needs to be considered during the search for our permanent superintendent.","The rules need to be reassessed as to how clear and thorough they are in disclosing information related to ethics, conflicts of interest, and financial disclosures.  I personally can see how schedule H needs to be clarified in order for there to be no confusion in future financial disclosures.","The issue is not in policy but in practice of implementing those policies.  Data shows us that our students of color across the country are being disciplined more frequently and more harshly when they commit the same offenses as other students. Instead of trying to fix this on the back end by underreporting, we need to ensure that discipline policies are being implemented uniformly. A good first step is implementing restorative practices to rebuild trust and relationships in our schools.","The rollout of Common Core was problematic; however, the principles of voluntary standards for educators to use their own professional discretion to engage students in learning is a positive step in education.  The PARCC exams along with other standardized tests are one way to measure student success, but they should not be the be the only way we judge our educational institutions. Often these standardized tests get in the way of actual instruction. I would like to see more longitudinal data on how our institutions prepare our students for the next steps in their lives.","Red lining and other racially discriminatory practices are a definite part of our past as a community and we need to recognize that fact.  At the same time, disrupting neighborhood schools due to busing causes major public strife, which is why the community school model needs to be embraced and enacted for those schools that have the most need.  As a teacher in a diverse school, I believe that all students benefit from being around peers that are different from them, and while attendance zone lines can play a part in that benefit, it shouldn't be the only method.","I think the best first step is to follow the model that Anne Arundel has established, tailoring it to our own unique needs.

Consistently, our concerns fall on deaf ears.  I joined the Northeast Advisory to champion the concerns of parents, teachers, and students to the Board.  In this role, I felt that escalating the concerns directly to the Board would result in positive change.  But that was not the case.    I am running to stay on the Board because I am tired of empty promises.  The Board must hold itself accountable to the stakeholders we represent.  All concerns must be handled openly and fairly. The Board must hold BCPS responsible for making this information publicly available and for delivering solutions.  Board and BCPS work must be transparent and driven by data.  This is especially critical for budget planning.  Decisions made in secrecy serve the decision makers - not those they represent.  Accountability to stakeholders is the most important issue facing the BOE.  We must remove barriers to effective teaching and learning.  We need to refocus on providing the basic needs of our students and teachers - safe, healthy, learning and working environments.  We must develop long term plans for increased staffing to lower class sizes and for investment in our facilities.  We must listen to our teachers and provide them with the staff and support they need in order to focus on teaching.  Our teachers know what our students need.  It is our job to make sure that they have the tools they need.","Effective teaching and learning require tools aligned with specific learning objectives. Technology is not a one-size-fits-all solution. It has a place in the classroom for certain tasks. Writing code would be difficult without a device. Research can be enabled by having web access. Technology is not a substitute for a teacher. Moderation and appropriateness of use must be monitored.  The STAT (1:1 device) initiative is neither balanced nor fiscally responsible. There are no controls in place to ensure that student devices are used appropriately - with reasonable time limits and with restricted use for instructional tasks that require computing. Instead,  instructional time by teachers has been replaced by time on devices. Programs such as Dreambox and iReady have minimum time requirements.  Computerized ""instruction"" is not proven to result in improved learner outcomes. Rather, studies have shown that overuse of technology has led to serious cognitive and social deficiencies.  Teachers report declines of focus, social skills, knowledge, and critical thinking.   The costs of STAT continue to be unnecessarily exorbitant. BCPS has spent a ridiculous amount of money on the devices. There is no justification for the device selected based on real usage.  For online uses, a basic device is more than sufficient.  Device selection should be made on usage.  But all students receive the same device - why?  What concerns me most about STAT is the opportunity cost.  Hundreds of millions of dollars could be allocated toward more urgent needs  - deteriorating facilities, increased staffing, free meals, and safety and security.","The system effectively identifies those schools with populations of students requiring additional supports.  Additional funding is required for those supports - to provide all students with the necessary resources to be successful in school.  I have supported funding for additional staff such as counselors, social workers, and pupil personnel workers to increase access to these services for students in need.  I also support expanding student access to free meals, healthcare, and programs such as AVID which give students the best chance for success. I have called for, and support expansion of mentoring programs and enrichment opportunities - such as STEM, as well as increased funding for Career & Technical Education programs.","Superintendent oversight is the responsibility of the entire Board - not just the Board Chair.  Current processes, which limit oversight responsibility to the Board Chair, need to be revisited to ensure that the full Board has insight as to the activities of the superintendent.  The Board, as a group, must examine and approve superintendent travel and expense reports as well as vendor interactions and outside activities. The superintendent must be held accountable to provide complete and accurate information requested by the Board, in a timely manner.  Information requests by any Board member, not just by the Chair, should be fulfilled. Board members should not be required to file Public Information Act requests in order to receive the information needed to make decisions.","The system's rules on ethics, conflicts of interest and financial disclosure are largely sufficient; however, the processes by which we enforce those rules are not adequate.  All financial disclosures should be examined closely and revisited periodically to rule out conflicts of interest.  All staff should be required to complete annual, comprehensive ethics and financial disclosure training.  The Board needs insight into BCPS vendor interactions and must consider any potential conflicts of interest before awarding contracts - particularly ed tech contracts.  An independent audit will hopefully identify additional opportunities to strengthen Board rules and processes to address potential impropriety and undue influence, particularly with regards to BCPS procurement.","BCPS behavior and discipline policies are woefully inadequate, leaving too much discretion to school administrators to determine what consequences, if any, will be administered for offenses. Minimum disciplinary actions must be spelled out in policy and must be tracked and enforced. Consequences are not being delivered consistently throughout the system.  This must be addressed through policy and enforced through regular audits. The safety of students and teachers must be paramount when making disciplinary decisions. If alternative placements are appropriate, that must be the course of action.  We cannot continue to place students and teachers in harm's way by allowing repeat violent offenders to return to the classroom. We must get these students the help they need, but must also protect those at risk of harm.",I support empowering teachers with the flexibility to adapt curriculum as they see fit to meet the needs of all students - to meet the shared goals of college and career readiness.  Our teachers are professionals and know best how to accomplish that goal. We need to give them the latitude to do so.  PARCC testing is both costly and time consuming and I support alternative assessment methods.  Our students need more instructional time - not testing.,"Yes, increasing the diversity in our schools should be a consideration when considering school boundaries.  However, it is not the only factor.  The health and safety of students should be the primary factor when determining school attendance areas.  Students who can safely walk to a school (as determined by Board policy), should be assigned to that school.  Balancing enrollment across adjacent schools is also critical to student health and safety.  One school cannot be left overcrowded when nearby schools have excess capacity.  Transportation safety is another key concern when considering school boundaries.  Students need to travel safely to and from school, with minimal ride times.  When changing school boundaries, we must consider the emotional and social impact on students and impact of splitting communities and peer groups, which can have painful, lasting consequences.  Changing school attendance areas is not to be taken lightly, and must involve all communities affected.","A long-term, independent facilities plan is needed to address issues objectively and to prioritize capital construction projects and spending. I would urge contracting with an outside firm to review and evaluate facility conditions including overcrowding, and to develop, without influence, a ten-year plan and budget for addressing our urgent school facility needs.  Such a plan would prioritize projects based on an overall school environment rating and would also make recommendations on short-term improvements to maximize the safety and comfort of schools. Data, not politics, should determine the prioritization of new construction and renovations. In addition to sponsoring this study, I would work with the County Council to enact legislation that would require Board approval for school construction projects that deviate from the master plan.",Why do you want to serve on the county school board?,Has the county’s use of educational technology in the classroom been appropriate?

,YES,baltimore-county/board-of-education,4,Gaston A. Horne,Horne,8/27/1989,Owings Mills,Non-Partisan,I attended schools in the BCPS. I graduated from Catonsville High and finished 3 years at Coppin State University,"Currently I am a purchasing specialist with American Office.

My experience is varied and includes positions more associated with the arts and performance as well as business, vocational and educational jobs.",,horneforeducation@gmail.com,,,,http://surveygizmoresponseuploads.s3.amazonaws.com/fileuploads/296249/4299887/95-2ea266e59627996fc1602b43d3a9d943_20180327_212223.jpg,"I think BCPS students are being short-changed, especially in my district. We're told that BCPS graduates 90% of students on time, but when you look a little closer, you can see that we're graduating students who aren't ready for all that college or adulthood requires of them. They don't have experience with financial literacy, they're not prepared academically for college in some cases, and those that decide to forgo college in favor of going into the work force often don't know all of their options. We want students who are globally competitive, but in my opinion, we aren't helping enough. Teachers need more resources, students need more time, and I don't think we're doing enough to help them get what they need.  With that said, BCPS does some things well. We offer very rigorous courses, schools are well kept for the most part, and that high graduation rate is great. But these things are disproportional across districts. In my district, that graduation rate is lower for some schools, the buildings are not as modernized as those elsewhere in the county, teachers have a lot more students in every class than they should and there's a general sense of frustration around education. I don't think that's right. School is supposed to be a type of training for our young people to enter the world and we can do better.","Technology in the classroom certainly helps, but again, is it being distributed equally? There's no denying that having access to the internet and its wealth of information can provide positive experiences for students, and even social media can be used to create positive global relationships that can give students a new or different view of the world. However, we must do more to ensure that every student gets this opportunity, not just the students in richer parts of the county. This technology can help prepare students for the next steps in their lives. Technology based careers are on the rise and certainly won't be going anywhere, and colleges are moving towards more online course work. Exposing students to technology early and often can be a huge boost for our students in their efforts to become globally competitive.  Incorporating some technology into the building could help just as much as keeping technology involved in student learning. I think we could also use technology to help teachers and to help keep students safe. For example, instead of using something invasive to keep our students safe, such as metal detectors or armed guards, we could do something like using the ID cards that students already carry. We could have students swipe their ID to enter the school building or to check into class (something that teachers and professionals already have to do) and we keep track of who is in the building and save teachers some time by keeping track of attendance.","I don't believe they are. My district is very minority heavy and a fair amount of lower income students. There is significantly less technology in classrooms, money put towards building maintenance or educational programming in this district when compared to other areas in the county. I think the focus on higher testing scores as opposed to student improvement has contributed to this disparity. I also think the lack of funding has resulted in teachers who prefer to teach elsewhere in the county, if not in another county entirely. We need to correct this disparity. It's doing a colossal disservice to the students of this district.","I do not see a distinction between the failures of bother superintendents. Ignorance is not an excuse at this level. There are far too many teachers, administrators and most importantly students, that depend on the sound decision making of the superintendent. Outside of personal accountability, I think public transparency will go a long way towards keeping the board and the superintendent from making mistakes.","Obviously, the systems rules need some changes in regards to enforcing these rules after the previous scandals with the superintendent. I think the current rules as far as reporting conflicts of interest and financial issues are good, but the enforcement is lacking. In my opinion, we need a process that offers either more transparency to the public, or more automation so that board members or the superintendent don't have any opportunity to violate any rules or ethics. There are small changes that could be made, such as delegating maintenance of schools by rotation instead of having companies bid on contracts. That would eliminate the chances of someone falling into a conflict of interest by awarding contracts based on who they know personally.  On the other hand, we could require more decisions to be issued directly to students and parents as opposed to posting them online with the board meeting notes.","For the most part, I think the system's rules do keep students safe. I think overall, the blanket rules are doing what they were meant to do. However, there are some kinks that could be worked out. At some schools students complain about lots of small things that present a risk to student safety. For example, students I've spoken with in my district complain that its too easy for people to sneak on to campus from the surrounding public and they've done things as simple as saying hello to a teacher or student they know to things as heinous as selling drugs. Students complain that they feel uncomfortable when they use bathrooms on campuses or when they're on campus after normal school hours or during an event. Some of those things just need better enforcement of rules that already exist. Whether that would include more police officers on campus, or more cameras or something else would require more research. However, we can do a lot to make students feel safer and more comfortable on campus by doing some simple fixes like modernizing and fixing bathrooms that are broken down, fixing the lights that surround a school's campus so that areas are better lit at night, or shrinking class sizes so that its easier for teachers to give more attention to each student. All in all, I think the rules are fine, but we could do a little more to make them work better.","I don't think they work. The ideas behind them are fine, but in practice, it seems like something is missing. It is telling that when I help my little sister with her English essay, she is confused because her teacher's advice doesn't match the rubric from the exam's grading system, and neither of them matches what a college professor would expect.  But we need guidelines for what we should teach students, and when they should be expected to learn it. We need testing of some sort because it provides a method to see where students are in relation to others. Tests are important. But I don't think the PARCC test is helpful. It's supposed to test college readiness, but academics aren't the only thing that leads to collegiate success. On top of that, the success rates on this test have varied wildly from district to district. There are some schools that have 86% of students listed as ""college ready."" But there are other schools that are at 4%, which tells me that this test hasn't led to any real changes in curriculum or funding or teaching methods. The key to the county's success as a whole isn't to force everyone into the same box and test them as a whole. Students need individual attention so they can improve. School success should be measured by that personal improvement as opposed to any one test. I don't think standardized tests are an accurate representation of how well schools are serving their students.","I think it should be up to a point. Obviously, we can't force different groups of people to move into new areas, and it would be hard to stretch some zones to add in those different groups. However, I think diversity is extremely important in schools. Students need to interact with people who are different from them. Not only does it teach practical lessons such as acceptance and tolerance, but it is more of a reflection of real adult life. When you go out into the world, you aren't going to be around people just like you 100% of the time, and that is an important thing for students to get used to as early as possible. On top of that, diversity also leads to ideas. People see the world differently, and their race, ethnicity and background all influence that vision. Including diversity, along with curriculum that encourages discussion and critical thinking on those different beliefs can go a long way in preparing students for the future. Being exposed to different ideas can help students develop their own voice and their own ideas and their own views of the world and that will ultimately help them achieve greater success when they leave BCPS.","I don't particularly think the county has done a good job of prioritizing construction and renovation, at least not in all cases. For the most part, schools have been built when and where they need to be. The new buildings have been both functionally and aesthetically pleasing. I think the county hasn't done a great job when it comes to maintaining and upgrading existing school facilities. There are several schools in my district that have gotten money, but that money went to updating football fields and athletic facilities as opposed to simpler, easier fixes that would positively affect more students and teachers. Sports are important, but we should update classrooms, bathrooms, make sure the HVAC systems are updated in each building and the like. No student in Baltimore County should need to go to a trailer or portable room to take a class. And we certainly shouldn't have any students worried about heating or cooling or bathroom conditions while they attend class. We have the money to fix those problems, and I think we should prioritize those issues before we pump more funding into other areas.",Why do you want to serve on the county school board?,Has the county’s use of educational technology in the classroom been appropriate?

Since graduating from the University of Maryland School of Law in 1999, I have pursued this mission as a litigator, policy advocate and nonprofit leader. I recently gave birth to twins and see service on the county school board as an extension of this mission that directly impacts my own children's future. My decision to run is further fueled by recent events that demonstrate that the county school system needs stronger, more proactive and more accountable leadership.  I have the skills and experience to help provide this leadership, and I am willing to put in the work.","I support supplying each student with his/her own laptop but the county's approach to acquiring and using the laptops and other educational technology (ET) in the classroom must be re-evaluated. ET is an important tool to support learning but it does not trump teachers, curriculum and a student's own learning process. Thus the introduction of ET into the classroom must be informed by these other elements, as opposed to these elements having to conform to the ET. In addition, it is imperative that the county be proactive in identifying the potential for waste, fraud and unethical behaviors when making such large purchases and strengthen its policies and procedures to guard against negligence and corruption.","I believe that structural inequities exist within schools across our region and Baltimore County schools is not exception. I don't have any easy answers but one solution I propose is to subject the school budget to an Equity Impact Assessment (EIA).  Application of an EIA to all resource allocation decisions would force the school board and school administrators to affirmatively examine whether and how certain groups are or would be privileged or disadvantaged by the decision. Consistent application of an EIA would also surface and force the school board to transform policies, practices and procedures that create and/or perpetuate inequities.","Financial disclosures are  designed to be self-disclosures, which I believe is the right approach. I, however, think it is appropriate for the school board to take a ""trust but verify"" approach when it comes to oversight. For example, if the superintendent states that he or she has no interest in any business during the reporting period, the school board could confirm by running the superintendent's name through the Maryland Department of Assessments and Taxation, which has records of all businesses created in Maryland. This would not be a perfect approach for someone who is not a principal in the business or who has business interests outside of the state. Such a limited search, however, would have alerted the school board to Dance's potential conflict of interest.    It is troubling that White failed to disclose the income she received, and I find her explanation a bit porous. That said, I do see a distinction between Dance and White. According to the indictment, Dance not only failed to disclose his business relationships and income, but when questioned about it took affirmative steps to further hide or obscure it. My understanding is that when White was questioned about her failure to disclose she corrected it by filing an amended form. One is arguably an oversight while the other is a clear intent to deceive. There is a difference and the difference has weight.","I am not fully versed in the system's rules on ethics, etc., so am unable to evaluate their sufficiency. Even if deemed sufficient, there is clearly a need for additional training of those who are subject to the rules to ensure they understand them as well as the consequences for any violations.","Students of color and students with special needs in Baltimore County are much more likely to be suspended or expelled than their white counterparts, which is evidence that the school system's discipline policies are not adequately written and/or equally applied. I believe additional steps need to be taken to expose the school-to-prison pipeline and reform school discipline policies. I would begin by evaluating what we mean by ""poor behavior."" Today, students are disciplined for behaviors that were not subject to disciplinary action when I was a child. I also believe that school system must adopt an updated definition of safety that not only includes threats to physical safety, but also the threats that students face every day because of structural inequities driven by racial, gender and class bias. This broader definition will help ensure that policies and practices designed to address one kind of threat do not inadvertently exacerbate another kind of threat. Finally, I would require all school personnel be trained in implicit bias so that they each one is aware of how his/her own bias influences the way they interpret and respond to different students and their behaviors. Each of these proposed solutions should be co-designed by students, teachers, parents and administrators.","I think standardized tests have gotten out of hand and advocate that they all be re-evaluated, beginning with their stated objective. Moreover, I believe standardized tests are antiquated. When I was in high school, college-readiness was embraced as the ultimate goal, with vocational education offered as a lesser alternative for students who were not ""college ready."" Those days are gone. College readiness now stands on equal footing with training in technical careers as well as entrepreneurship.  Our public school systems should reflect this shift and provide robust education paths that allow students to experiment with and choose which path they pursue as opposed to being tracked into one path or another based on an arcane and/or biased standardized test.","Yes, diversity should be a factor. We live in a diverse world and students should be exposed to this diversity in their classroom and learning experiences.  I would not be a fan of gerrymandering attendance zones to achieve this diversity, but welcome innovative ways to achieve diversity that are not traditional or obvious.","To address facilities, I would advocate that the School Board flip the paradigm. I observe that too often school administrators allow facilities, capacity and enrollment to define student outcomes. This is backwards. I believe the correct approach is to set ambitious goals for student success and then work vigorously to conform every part of the system to those goals, including facilities, capacity and enrollment. In addition, in too many instances the school system finds itself absorbing the impact of various development projects on facilities, capacity and enrollment. If elected to the School Board, I would advocate that school system participate more proactively in the County's many development projects in order to inform whether, where and when development occurs, and better manage the opportunities and challenges any given project presents.",Why do you want to serve on the county school board?,Has the county’s use of educational technology in the classroom been appropriate?

I have a personal commitment to the system. I know what works and doesn't work.  I fought for better schools as a TABCO representative, writing letters, talking with legislators, and going to rallies. As a Special Ed. teacher, I advocated for more opportunities for students. As a parent, I demanded accountability of my daughter's schools. I see serving on the Board of Education as the next step. In knowing the system, I can hold the superintendent accountable, not only to budgeting but also to curricular and disciplinary issues. I believe my experience will benefit not just the teachers, students and parents in District 6, but all of Baltimore County.   I believe BCPS should prepare students for life, not just graduation. The leadership of BCPS made decisions that were often more about ulterior motives  than what was best for students, parents and teachers. Sometimes it seemed like making the Newsweek list was more important than our student's education. This mindset generated the agenda and priorities of the system. Many parents, teachers and students have been left out of the decision making process.  When I started in BCPS, participatory decision making was not only encouraged, it was common.   There are many great teachers in BCPS. There are many dedicated parents. There are many students who , now more than ever, need a world class education system based on authentic, tested and vetted programs.","Educational technology is a broad term. As a teacher, I utilized both software and hardware that was provided. There are phenomenal resources available, many of which greatly expanded student's educational  opportunities and abilities. Conversely, there were frequent changes in grading, and attendance programs. At one point, all the MAC computers were taken to be replaced with Dells, which were then again replaced.  Some programs were purchased that were not used.  Using technology became more important than effective teaching. Many programs were more geared toward test preparation than curricular enhancement. Support for these programs was inconsistent.  Teachers were not part of the decision process.  There are many misconceptions regarding the current contract. There is a sense of wasteful spending on top of ethics violations that obscures the issue. Students and teachers need training and access to technology. It is part of our world. The real question is not the expenditure but the benefits. My personal experience is BCPS has made some poor decisions. Some are contractually obligated. There needs to be better oversight and vetting of technology. BCPS must do a better job explaining the rationale for expenditures.  Issues that have not been fully explored are the medical and developmental aspects of computer use.  Research indicates students are using smart phones hours a day, not counting time on school computers. Research also suggests there are negative implications and addictive qualities which are counter to the purpose of education.","The quick answer is no; fair and equal are not the same.  To use an analogy, doctors don't provide the same care to all the patients who enter the hospital. Students who live in upper or middle class communities enter schools already with a background that puts them educationally at an advantage over students from low income areas. Poverty is not a volitional issue. Many children enter school already behind their age peers. Research shows poverty and stress have deleterious effects on a child's developing brain. Closing the educational gap is greater than just a classroom and/or teacher issue. Schools that are effective in low income areas are those that provide community support and have lower student to teacher ratios.  At one time, BCPS differentiated school staffing based on community needs. I taught in a high school that had over a dozen cuts in staffing when the superintendent decided to staff all high schools at the same level. Many new teachers are assigned to schools in low income areas and are not adequately prepared or trained for their position.  I believe there has been a lack of commitment to addressing the needs of students in low income and minority communities.  The issue of expenditures on technology is directly connected to the question of providing for the needs of all students. Many community members feel services for low income areas were sacrificed to finance technology. Dr. Dance's actions contribute to that perspective.","Having someone with experience in the system, who knows the contractual agreements with teachers and is versed in educational pedagogy will make a difference. I commend the current BOE for taking the initiatives to hold the superintendent accountable. They changed the relationship dynamic between the BOE and superintendent.  The shift means the superintendent will have to justify plans and not just report plans to the BOE.Philosophically I question how the superintendent can be a member of the organization to which he/she is accountable.  There is an annual survey completed by teachers which essentially asks if school administrators are following the contract between the BOE and TABCO. These surveys can be used as another structure for oversight. The contractual agreement has been violated by principals with impunity and coercion. The BOE must hold the superintendent responsible for ensuring the Master Agreement is followed. BCPS policy states that any program or material developed by a teacher is the property of BCPS. The superintendent should not be allowed to receive money when doing business in his role as superintendent.  There is a difference between the actions of Dr. Dance and Dr. White. What is a greater concern is how Dr. White is seen by the parents, teachers and students of Baltimore County. There is a sense of betrayal that needs to be addtessed and resolved. As many of the BOE candidates can attest, the financial disclosure process used by BCPS has room for improvement and clarity.","Obviously not.  As I addressed in the previous question, the policy on teachers should be applied to the superintendent.  The culture of the system has not been one of transparency and integrity. The current BOE has begun the shift to greater accountability and integrity. The next BOE will continue this direction. If the superintendent is giving a lecture from the position of superintendent, he/she should not receive money except for expenses, paid for by BCPS. In no way should a superintendent benefit financially from outside sources when acting in the capacity as superintendent, period!    Distinctions on what constitutes a conflict of interest or ethics violation need to be amended to take into account the shift in educational marketing. School systems are relying more on outside providers for computers, software and curricular materials. BCPS drastically cut the budget for books and increased the budget for technology. Schools are purchasing more of the items used on a daily basis and not generating these in house.  Educational resources has become profitable. This goes beyond just technology and includes consulting services. There are a number of ""Principal Academies"" that are all vying for participants and instructors. Dr. Dance participated in one. The BOE and possibly the legislative bodies need to delineate the limits to which the superintendent can participate in non-BCPS activities and receive compensation.","The discipline policies do not generate a climate of safety, not just for students but also for teachers. School administrators were directed to reduce suspensions without being given resources for alternative measures.  While most students act in a socially acceptable manner, there are students who exhibit behaviors that are disruptive in school and if left unchecked, will result in negative consequences out in the community. BCPS has not been transparent.  BCPS must create a new mindset around school climate. First, there have to be  clear expectations for school behavior. BCPS has to move away from the binary mindset and system of managing school climate. Students with behavioral issues need support, not punishment, by qualified personnel.  A recent study indicates there is a long term, financial cost to students in a classroom with one disruptive student.  Teachers leaving the profession indicate discipline is a major factor.   More alternatives need to be available. The Alternative School program needs revision. Word count prohibits elaboration. Behavior management programs which are used effectively in other systems can be used in BCPS.  The Master Agreement specifies school discipline plans are to be created with faculty input. That needs to be followed. Additional personnel and resources need to be budgeted.  Research by neurologists should be incorporated in staff development which includes the superintendent. The role of SROs needs to examined.  BCPS needs to promote greater parent and student involvement and ownership in creating school climate.","I was Co-Chair of the MD State Teacher's Association committee investigating the impact of No Child Left Behind and was part of a committee that created a report on accountability for the NEA.  Common Core and the PARCC exams are simply extensions of educational policy created under NCLB. There are many misunderstandings, and a lack of transparency around both Common Core and PARCC.  Having standards and expectations is essential. Having methods to assess levels of attainment and provide feedback are essential. The current system though does neither. NCLB, Common Core and PARCC all come out of the mindset of managing schools with data.  I was frequently told to ""get your students to pass"" a test by administrators who were more concerned with a statistic than the student. Resources and classtime were redirected toward passing HSAs and PARCC. Teachers had more invested in test outcomes than the students so that the tests did not reflect student achievement. Some students took multiple rounds of assessments. Programs were created for those students who did not pass the exams. initially these were to be completed individually but students didn't. Schools began doing the alternative programs during classtime as the pressure to raise graduation rates intensified.  Graduation rates have risen, as have the number of students taking remedial classes in college. College graduation rates have decreased while college debt as increased. Education policy has become politicized. Half of all teachers leave within 5 years. Something is not working.","In many respects, schools are as segregated as before Brown v. BOE.   School superintendents have tried to close the educational gap by focusing resources to schools with low performing students and  have effectively accepted a policy of separate but equal. To quote the Washington Post, ""Racial achievement gaps were narrowest at the height of school integration.""  Desegregation efforts ended around 1990. While forced busing may not be the solution, there are other alternatives. BCPS already has Magnet schools with open enrollment. Open enrollment could be expanded. School attendance zones could include two or three options, especially in more segregated neighborhoods. Many parents associate schools in low income areas with other negative factors unrelated to the quality of the teachers. This mindset is pervasive but also fallacious. Nevertheless, parents in wealthier neighborhoods will protect their schools.","The current Budget proposal addresses many needs. Installing air conditioning and renovating buildings is not the only area though. There are schools that have malfunctioning air and heating systems. There are bathrooms with broken fixtures. There needs to be a more thorough inventory of structural needs within the county. From that list, priorities can be established.    Getting community input is essential.  Many feel there is an inequity in prioritizing needs. The BOE must reestablish trust within the community by holding hearings. The BOE can act as a conduit between communities and legislators who appropriate the funds.   Many of the issues facing BCPS are contextual. The leadership style has been authoritarian from the superintendent into the school building.  The Master Agreement has been violated with impunity. Curricular changes have been made without vetting and decisions about school construction and renovation have been made without transparency.

Now they propose to buy the same laptop for high school seniors as they do for kindergarten students.  As a former computer programmer and analyst, I can tell you that this makes no sense.  They have not addressed the issue of students (particularly the very young ones) visiting sites on their laptops that are completely inappropriate.  Besides being prone to misuse when they are working, many times the laptops are not working.  It is an unreasonable burden on the teachers to have students using laptops with so many problems.  The proposed educational technology budget increases by $10.4 million (over its existing base) and that money can be better utilized.","As stated in the Interim Superintendent's letter regarding the FY2019 Proposed Operating Budget:  ""The proposed FY2019 budget improves student-to-teacher ratios and instructional caseloads across the system for both special education and English learner students.""  The reason for this is that the five-year growth rates for students identified with disabilities has increased much faster than overall enrollment growth.  Thus, those schools that have a greater need do receive a greater share of the system's resources.","The superintendent should represent one of the pinnacles of success in the education field and should be someone that everyone respects.  Yes, there is a distinction between the failures of Dallas Dance and the failures of Verletta White, but the failures were made nonetheless and should not be ignored.  Baltimore County can and should do better.  The Board should not tolerate such lapses in judgment.  The superintendent's salary is approximately a quarter of a million dollars a year and should be more than enough to concentrate solely on Baltimore County students and not prompt one to seek out consulting opportunities.","Yes, the rules on ethics, conflicts of interest, and financial disclosure are sufficient, but the oversight of personnel following the rules is insufficient.  In addition to the mistakes of Dallas Dance and Verletta White, we also have the case of Robert Barrett.  As noted in a letter to the editor published in the Baltimore Sun on March 18, 2018:  ""The Baltimore County school system was viewed as being scandal free for 170 years until Messrs. Dance and Barrett temporarily besmirched this reputation and violated the trust the Board of Education placed in them to continue to improve the educational programs for girls and boys.""  The Board of Education needs to be pro-active in ensuring that the school system regains its excellent reputation.","The current discipline policies are comprehensive, but sometimes the policies are not carried out in a timely enough fashion regarding students who exhibit poor behavior.  Those students should be dealt with promptly so that the majority of students do not suffer.","Exams have been a part of school since schools began, but too many exams are not useful.  Since 2013, 15 states--from red state Alabama to blue state Rhode Island--have stopped participating in the PARCC exams.  Only six states now use the PARCC exams and only two (Maryland and New Mexico) use them for most grades.  What's wrong with this picture?","Whenever new school attendance zone lines are drawn, students should be allowed to attend the nearest school in their neighborhood.  Diversity may be a factor, but it should not be a primary factor.  The focus should be on what is best for the student.","I agree with the priorities for school construction and renovation that have been set by state and county fiscal partners, the Board of Education, state and county elected officials, communities, and various other stakeholders, specifically, first, complete the installation of central air-conditioning in all schools; second, build new schools for the growing population; third, modernize high schools through either limited renovations or replacement schools; and fourth, replace essential infrastructure and building systems.

The unethical behavior and absence from office of the recent superintendent (and the Board of Education's failure to take action) are inexcusable. I am also very concerned about the recent bribery indictment of a high level executive and the failure of the Interim Superintendent to report outside income. The large expenditure of public funds to furnish laptopps to every student is not warranted in the absence of proof that such technology will markedly improve our students' academic skills. This contract was not duly reviewed and questioned and this must not be allowed to happen in the future. I have the requisite skills in large organizations, procurement, and policy and budget analysis to make a difference serving on the Board.","It has not. A commitment to expend an exorbitant amount of taxpayer money on educational technology is unwise and I strongly believe that the monies would be better spent to improve teacher compensation, provide in-school support services such as counsellors and school psychiatrists, and to provide resources to close student achievement gaps. Major recommendations are forthcoming from the Kirwan Commission and BCPS must be in a position to increase or shift funding to implement those Commission recommendations. Having made such a huge commitment to educational technology will make it difficult to find the funds necessary. Also of concern is the construction or renovation of our aging schools - perhaps the educational technology funds would have been better spent to address this.","I believe that BCPS is not doing enough to provide support for Title I schools and second language students. These students are particularly at risk of not succeeding in school and are those most likely to require remedial work before attending college. A detailed analysis of the school system budget is necessary to ascertain how funds are being spent and if they do, in fact, support the mission and goals. Priorities must be clearly established, sufficient funds appropriated, and spending done in accordance with the budget plan. I would support the Board conducting a quarterly budget variance analysis to monitor spending to ensure that funds are being spent as planned.","The Board of Education must be prepared to regularly monitor the Superintendent's performance and hold that leader strictly accountable to their contract and to the highest levels of ethical integrity. That person is being paid very well to lead BCPS and must be in the office to do so - travel out of state must be minimal and monitored by the Board. While the dollar magnitude of Dr. Dance's failure to report outside income and involvement with firms conducting business with BCPS greatly exceeded Interim Superintendent White's failure to report incomefrom an outside source doing business with BCPS , the core principal is the same.",I believe the existing rules are sufficient but they must be monitored and enforced to be effective.,I think that the policies keep students safe but making suspensions a reflection of a school's (and principal's)  performance sometimes places countervailing pressures on school leadership to make decisions that are best for the school community. Proper discipline supports the classroom teacher and removing disruptive students may improve the learning experience for the other students. These decisions must be allowed to be made without regard to measuring anyone's performance.,"They both have their place but have achieved undue importance and value, and have detracted from student learning by requiring teachers to ""teach to the test"". The Board of Education must review both and if necessary, work with the State Board of Education to lessen their importance.",It should be a factor but if all schools had adequate resources to close any existing achievement gaps it would not be necessary. Perhaps even considering this factor is an indictment of how funds are currently being spent? Other concerns are the length of time spent on school buses and the effects of taking children out of their community.,The current process appears broken and highly politicized. I believe the new elected/appointed hybrid Board has the potential to make such decisions in a less politicized environment but it must be provided with adequate staff to do such analysis (and also budget and contract analysis).

In 2009, I began to teach at CCBC.  I was appalled to learn that each and every semester thousands of students, the vast majority recent graduates of Baltimore County high schools, had not learned enough to pass the CCBC placement test that used 6th grade curriculum.  In 2009, CCBC offered 7700 seats for remedial math, remedial reading, and remedial English.  As a college adjunct, I spent full semesters teaching high school graduates how to write a paragraph (ENG 051) and how to write a five paragraph essay (ENG 052).  How did students who can't write a paragraph or have never written an essay graduate from high school?  In fact, how did those students make it to high school since writing paragraphs and creating essays is part of the elementary school curriculum?  Each semester, I engaged my students in a discussion of how they ended up needing up to seven remedial classes before they could ever take a credited course.  There was a theme to my students' responses, ""As long as I showed up and didn't screw up, I was moved to the next grade.""  This philosophy of ""moving students along"" has done wonders for BCPS's graduation rates; unfortunately, it has also created thousands of uneducated graduates.","I do not agree that every student in Baltimore County needs his/her own laptop.  I understand that one push for 1:1 laptops was to create a more level playing field for students who may not have access to a computer at home, but access to technology does not ensure academic success just as lack of technology doesn't ensure academic failure.  My daughters are all BCPS graduates.  While each used computers in school, none had a dedicated laptop.  In spite of that, or perhaps because of it, all of my daughters are highly educated and highly successful.  In 2016, Psychology Today reported that too much screen time ""is the very thing impeding the development of the abilities that parents are so eager to foster.  The ability to focus, to concentrate, to lend attention, to sense other people's attitudes and communicate with them, to build a large vocabulary—all those abilities are harmed.""  To be academically successful, kids need to be able to communicate with their teachers and their peers.  They need to be able to concentrate and work collaboratively with others.  They need to learn how to handle down time without having a screen in their faces.  Technology has place in learning, but it shouldn't be the only tool in an educator's toolbox.  The millions of dollars spent on a laptop for every student would have been better spent on computers for every classroom and a more robust toolbox that meets the needs of all students.","Resources are not fairly and equitably divided among schools.  Schools that are successful in having parents complete the Free and Reduced Lunch form often get significant Title I dollars while schools who have just as many needs, but that haven't gotten parents to complete the form, do without.  It could literally mean the difference between one school having an Interactive White Board while another school has chalkboards.  Even if the school is successful in getting parents to complete and turn in forms, the school might be needy enough to benefit from Title I dollars but, on paper, not needy enough to qualify for those dollars.  Additionally, student support resources may not be adequate to meet the needs of minority and/or low income students.  These students have unique needs that may require additional staffing because even the best teacher can't solve all of the psychosocial and environmental problems that get in the way of students learning.","Having a new board that is comprised primarily of elected members will be beneficial to providing increased oversight over the superintendent.  It should minimize cronyism and increase the diversity of opinions, background, and experiences that new members will bring.  New board members should create a charter for how the newly elected board will move forward.  The charter should include language on how decisions will be made, what steps will be taken to ensure transparency, and what actions will and will not be tolerated by board members and the superintendent.  The newly elected board must identify key stakeholders and created a process where these stakeholders are heard and where their opinions are respected.  Stakeholders must include teachers.  No decision that affects students and/or teachers should be made without teacher input.  Who knows better than teachers what is needed in the classroom?  As agendas are set for board meetings, they should be disseminated early and often to all teachers and to all parents so that decisions that are made represent the views of stakeholders and not just the board.  There is no distinction between the disclosure failures of Dallas Dance and those that Ms. White has admitted to.  Even if Ms. White's actions were due to confusion, her actions represent poor judgment and Baltimore County needs a superintendent who makes sound decisions, is transparent, and is beyond reproach.","The system's rules are obviously not sufficient.  If they were, Dallas Dance would not be facing up to five years in prison for perjury.  One would hope that any individual in a leadership position would have enough personal integrity that he/she would not violate ethics rules for personal gain, but that doesn't seem to be the case.  The board needs to create an unbiased independent task force that looks at any and all transactions made from the day Dance was hired until the present day.  Based on the findings of the task force, guidelines should be created/changed to be clear on what constitutes an ethics violation and what actions could be deemed a conflict of interest.  The guidelines should clearly state that violation of the guidelines will result in immediate removal of the violator from his/her position.  There has to be more accountability and much more transparency.","The school system's discipline policy does very little to keep students safe or to discipline students who exhibit poor behavior. I am a volunteer in a BCPS elementary school.  I am shocked at the behavior of some of the students and even more shocked that there are no consequences for poor, and even violent, behavior that puts other students and teachers at risk.  I have seen a teacher send a student to the office for continued misbehavior, and I have seen that same student an hour later on the playground with his peers.  When another student opened a stapler and began to slap fellow students in the back of their heads, the teacher was pressured to take the offending student back in the classroom after a short period in the office.  When there are no consequences for poor behavior, there is no incentive to change that behavior and many kids will develop a lifelong sense of entitlement to act any way they want to.  BCPS needs to create and abide by a discipline policy that has clearly outlined consequences for any behavior that threatens others and/or interrupts learning.  Parents must be part of the solution and if progressive, but supportive, consequences don't work, poorly behaving students, and their parents, must understand that they may have to be educated in an alternative location that is staffed and trained to deal with the many psychosocial issues that can contribute to poor behavior.","Exams at certain times can be beneficial IF they provide real time feedback that teachers can use to drive instruction.  Preparing for PARCC exams takes a tremendous amount of time that should be used for instruction.  Essentially, all instruction stops when PARCC is being administered.  Most importantly, PARCC results are not available to a teacher until the student who took PARCC this year has moved to another grade and another teacher.  This gap impedes a teacher's ability to implement changes that improve learning.   Common Core can be beneficial, especially in math.  However, given the level of differentiation that is expected in classrooms - language, abilities, motivation - it is next to impossible for a ""common"" curriculum to be used effectively.  How can a teacher who has students who are on grade level, above grade level, and, in some cases, two years below grade level be expected to successfully implement the same ""common"" curriculum in his/her class when these disparities exist?  The bigger issue is, ""Why test kids at all if nothing meaningful is done with the results?""   By one of BCPS's measures of ""success,"" the percentage of Grade 3 students demonstrating on grade-level reading has dropped from 56.9% in FY 2016 to 56.4% in FY 2017, YET, last March (2017), Dallas Dance decreed that no BCPS elementary school student could be retained for any reason.  How did this decree help the almost 44% of Grade 3 students who weren't reading on grade level more than halfway through the year?","No, for the most part, diversity should not be a factor in decisions regarding school zones.  Children should be able to attend school with other children from their neighborhoods.  However, if there is a high percentage of at risk students in a particular geographic area, schools in that area must be adequately funded to ensure that the unique needs of this population are met.  This may mean more teachers so that class sizes are smaller and more support staff like counselors and teaching assistants.  The exception to this could be the collocation of students with specific ESOL needs in one school in a zone instead of spread across multiple schools.  This allows for the best use of resources and the best support for ESOL students.","The county must create a list of required features for any school.  The list should include things like adequate heating and cooling, adequate space to facilitate learning, access to clean drinking water, adequate and working bathrooms for the school population, solid - not crumbling - infrastructure, no mold, no lead paint, and no safety hazards.  Each school in the county should be inventoried and given a score based on the decided ""required features"" list.  When a school doesn't meet one or more of the items on the ""required features"" list, the county must determine the cost to bring the school into compliance and compare that cost and the cost of maintaining the school to the cost of construction to replace the school.   This process should be implemented on a county, not district, level.  All schools in the county should have the same access to required features whether in a renovated school or a newly constructed school regardless of where they are located.",Why do you want to serve on the county school board?,Has the county’s use of educational technology in the classroom been appropriate?

Educators must be continuously supported and kept abreast of new trends and directions for student growth and development, purchased, managed, and levied with fiscal,  instructional, and managerial responsibility.  The philosophy for developing educators is the same as for students. For adults, we call it professional development; for students, we call it teaching. It is a cycle and none of it is free or inexpensive.  Human beings must always be more important to educational and human growth than a computer. Access to computers is very important in the 21st century world, and schools should see that there is that access, but the cost should not exceed the cost to hire hire and retain personnel who will balance the relationship! There must be fiscal responsibility and management oversight, defining the   process for the use of the technology.  A  great deal of money was spent on a good idea, the laptops, but with very little planning or management!","As a principal and since retirement, I have heard repeatedly that staffing and resources would be levied to schools based on needs ...poverty, number of special needs students, number unqualified educators, need for instructional support, and provision for counseling and mental health supports; this has never seemed to happen, thus leaving students and those who educate them disadvantaged. Certainly, there are areas in the county which are clearly defined by the number of students who receive free and reduced meals, who have poor state and local test scores, and high disciplinary rates. What, also, correlates with these numbers are the statistics which indicate transient populations and sometimes limited parental support.  That this has been the case way too long,indicates that resources have been lacking.,  This system has embraced the concept of the community school. The concept means engaging staff in professional development and increasing teaching tools to close gaps and to help students catch up…the concept  means using programs to access and engage community people and parents to give them opportunities to speak honestly and openly…the concept of the  initiative means using a needs assessment to garner funding and staffing attached to the findings. The coordinator is to be a seasoned person who has demonstrated an ability to read data and act on it, reach out to parents and communities, and who has demonstrated strong teaching, work, or supervision skill with those being served. The concept described here is in place with the jury still out on its success","School boards are managers of a system.   Rules must be known, questions asked, pressed if needed. The relationship is not one of friendship but management on every level!When Dr. Dance was given his second contract, it was already known that he had not complied completely with the tenets of the ethics disclosure forms, albeit how out of compliance was not known. He was diligent and concerted in his efforts to deceive and hide his finances and holdings from the people in Baltimore County Schools and no one could read his mind and know everything. I think the Board and the Ethics Panel will be more deliberate in how to oversee these matters in the future, working with the Board attorneys, and  each other. This includes how money is spent...what is the process, the management process, the execution. Mrs, White, as I understand her situation, did not disclose money received for participating in training versus employment opportunities or a personal business endeavor.  I believe that when we are in doubt, ask. I am sure she will ask from now on. I also believe that ignorance is not bliss; it is merely ignorance; we learn, hopefully, from our moments of ignorance ...which we all have experienced.  I see no correlation between what the former superintendent did and what was done by Mrs. White. I, also, see her as a more child/teacher centered and ethical person who follows through on commitments for the improvement of the children in this system.","Wherever there are rules of decorum, ethics, and delivery of services, those who manage and supervise must know them well. Being vigilant and aware of how we all are required to conduct ourselves and being transparent is important. For the sake of the order, it is imperative that questions are asked and oversight done regularly to maintain unblemished and focused attention on education. In light of the lack of information on the illegal behavior of the former superintendent, it is clear that more ways to oversee ethics issues, conflicts of interest, and financial disclosure must be found or reviewed, implemented, and managed. The current rules are not as much of the problem as how to monitor and manage the information supplied.","Rules are important; knowing and understanding the rules is important; following the rules is important The System, however, must engage staff, parents, students, and other stakeholders in discussions and training opportunities to recognize, assess, and find or create remedies for problems in each school. Funding must be found to hire health care professionals and develop community relationships; it is important to support the funding of treatment plans for staff and students, as well, in any of these areas of need. Students are often disciplined by removing them, but what is offered to them by professionals to amend their behaviors and the reasons behind the behavior is missing. Placing school resource officers in schools is a necessity for those inside the building and coming into the building; however, this must be merged with having students in classes with teachers and support personnel who have had training with recognizing  students who might seem to have social and emotional needs; the training should extend to how adults interact and talk to children as well.  The policies are there, but they are essentially AFTER THE FACT. We need to address  the symptoms so the negative behavior is thwarted.","Local school systems do have a responsibility to state and federal mandates and directions. Those mandates must be about the growth of our children, however. Common Core standards are measurable and do address standards which might well put them on par with other students in and out of the state. The rub here is that all students do not land at the same academic place at the same time or at the same level, thus leaving some students looking as if they have intellectual short-comings; not all teachers have the same skills levels at the same time to move students where they need to be without mentoring or staff development opportunities. Our first responsibility is to OUR STUDENTS and then  to the people who educate them. These mandates tend to be far reaching for they are levied on all of the children in the state in the same way and time, even when the socio-economic structure of the various systems are different, not to mention the students within the system.  Assessing a system, educator, and child in a ""cookie cutter"" manner is to ignore children and their needs, skills, interests.  All means all means that school boards and associations MUST be strong advocates for the educational integrity of the system.  PARCC will be given but should not be the final barometer for how a child sees himself; it should be the measuring rod to assess how to remedy the weaknesses.","Artificial lines seem problematic to me. Students should be able to attend schools near them or special schools to which they apply and are accepted. Now, if the lines are re-drawn because it is easier than making sure that every school in a system has the best teachers, needed staffing and related supports based on needs, top level teaching materials, equitable opportunities for upper level courses and career/technology paths, and courses to address special learning needs, then lines need to be drawn. It seems to me changing lines so that some students will be able to attend schools that some people think are good schools and the rest are relegated to schools that have the named needs is capricious and not necessarily fair. Are the lines going to be changed so that some students in strong areas will end up in a school that is not doing as well? Why not commit to making sure that all of the schools are well developed places for all of the students. I get the point; I am just concerned about who decides which students get to attend a stronger and more diverse program. Should we tell adults that they may not purchase the house of their choice because they will shift the diversity meter?  When magnet programs began, that was the federal governments thinking ...create programs which  naturally create a diverse environment.","Develop standards, benchmarks, and protocols for the maintenance and reporting about facilities, aging or new, over crowdedness, and changing demographics; create a skilled work force within the system to supply information about the needs and changes, and process how to correct or respond to the findings. All of this must be in concert with State and Local  elected officials who are a part of allocating funding.  There should be no political bias real or by appearance for why one school's needs are more pressing than another. Based on the outcries from schools, it appears that the protocols for maintenance of schools has been weak, leaving problems  untended until they become serious and expensive. As a former principal, there would be problems that we did not see or monitor because they were not matters that our backgrounds would recognize until they became significant problems. There were problems we saw and reported which did not get handled until we complained to our stakeholders who echoed our complaints.  The facilities department should have the protocols for regular maintenance of system properties.",Why do you want to serve on the county school board?,Has the county’s use of educational technology in the classroom been appropriate?

My major strengths lie in the fact that with the support of the community I will advocate to create and communicate an inspiring image that I have of our children's educational future. Through my hard work and tenacious advocacy, the education issues facing the 4th District will be properly addressed and resolved.",I feel that the County's use of educational technology in the classrooms has been appropriate and is needed to prepare our children for the technical future. Laptops have become an essential part of the learning process for children so I do support the system's expenditures for student laptops. Tools such as laptops help to bridge the digital divide facing children in so many communities.,I feel that the current system could be re-accessed to ensure that the resources are fairly and equitably divided among all Baltimore County schools. The system needs to put more resources into schools with large populations where there is overcrowding. Often times schools that are faced with overcrowding are under-resourced and are schools with large populations of minority and low-income students. These situations create pockets of poverty that are stifling for students' educational growth and can have a detrimental impact on their academic future.,"The board should make sure that the duties of the superintendent are well outlined and follow-up with the superintendent to ensure adequate oversight. The board must maintain oversight and work to make sure that the process is followed and that the superintendent is meeting tangible objectives. It is also the responsibility of the board to make sure that protocols are in place to ensure that the board manages the superintendent.  As a member of the board, one of the first things I'd like to do is to make sure that the superintendent gets help from either legal or ethics on exactly what the expectations are when submitting applications and filling out ethics forms. The board should work with legal to make sure that the income requirements are clear and offer assistance to explain what is expected on the form. I see a difference in that Verletta White may not have fully understood the distinction in what was considered income.","The system's rules on ethics, conflicts of interest and financial disclosure forms should be explained clearly and supported by the ethics and legal division. There should be the opportunity to get a clear definition of expectations and could be explained more by legal and ethics in clearer more concise manner.",The current discipline policies leave room for improvement in our schools. They are reactive rather than proactive to prevent disciplinary issues in students. I would work to ensure that proactive measures were put in place to prevent behavioral issues at schools. I would also make sure that there was adequate funding in the budget to give schools the resources necessary to appropriately address behavior issues.,"Both Common Core and the PARCC exams are markers of achievement for our schools and our students. However, as a result of the low test scores at certain schools, I believe that these test should be used as a guide to help the board identify the schools that have lower test scores and to develop a holistic plan of action to improve those test scores.","Yes, diversity should be one of many factors to take into account when drawing new school and attendance zone lines. The world that our children are growing up in has a diverse population. Our children should be educated in a diverse school that teaches our children about differences in people, culture, and background.","The county could devote additional resources to maintaining or replacing school buildings. I would set school construction as a priority based on the age, condition and if the school is overcrowded. I would put together a needs assessment report that would identify which schools were most in need of renovations or new building projects based on overcrowding, the age of the school and the condition of the school.",Why do you want to serve on the county school board?,Has the county’s use of educational technology in the classroom been appropriate?

I feel it is a crucial component of a healthy, vibrant community, and to our future in Baltimore County.  I am also personally committed to Baltimore County Public Schools in particular.  I am a Timonium/Ridgely/Dulaney High School graduate, and my children all attended and graduated from Baltimore County Public schools.  That said, I want to put my leadership and strategic thinking skills to work in order to help improve the quality of our schools and community.  With my deep experience spanning the factory floor to the boardroom, I am able to relate at all levels in this endeavor.  I have a track record of breaking down complex problems and collaborating to find solutions that are sustainable.","I think our students need to be prepared to thrive in the world around them.  This means we need to evolve the methods, tools and platforms in our school system as the world changes.    That said, we need to learn our way, in order to insure that our approach is both effective and efficient.  Whether it is the use of laptops, other devices or technology platforms, we need to pilot and qualify before we expand usage.","I would like to reserve any sweeping comments here until I better understand the overall situation.  We need a masterplan that looks at needs and wants, and then balances resources  holistically across the school system.  Most importantly, the process and outcome needs to be transparent to all.","I support routine auditing – both external and internal - in order to support a culture of accountability.  We then need to then lay out the corrective and preventative actions that need to be put in place as a result of audit findings.  And lastly, track our progress against these actions.  This is not complex, but it is hard work.","Clearly we have a problem that needs to be solved.  Of course we need clear rules and guidelines.  But we need to go further.  We need a culture of impeccable integrity in our school administration., where even the appearance of impropriety is not okay.","I would like to withhold specific recommendations here until I better understand our current disciplinary policies in Baltimore County, and how they benchmark against other school systems.  Every student has the right to expect a safe environment that fosters learning and growth.  This is a fundamental requirement, and therefore a top priority.","I do not have a problem with what Common Core is seeking to achieve - the establishment of consistent standards for education.  I think the real issues relate to effective implementation and  measurement of performance (via PARCC). .  Again, I think we owe it to ourselves to pilot different approaches and find solutions that work.","Diversity should definitely be among the key considerations when considering zoning.  While our schools need to reflect the communities they are in, I believe attendance school lines need to consider how to deliver a multicultural experience reflective of the world our students live in.","We need to look at the needs in Baltimore County holistically, meaning we cannot make any single decision in a vacuum.  However we determine to prioritize, it needs to happen in a collaborative, transparent manner.  We need to do what is best for the County as a whole.  As for Construction vs Renovation decisions, these need to undergo a thorough options analysis, and assessed through the lens of cost vs benefit.

Experience and a depth in perspective is what I will bring to the Baltimore County School Board, driven by charismatic leadership oriented in protecting and guiding the decisions that will govern our children, parents and teachers in the years ahead. I am the ideal choice for the following reasons:  I am a parent of two children who have been a part of BCPS for over 18 years. (My youngest son is a junior at Eastern Technical High School) I formerly served as PTA President and Vice President of Dundalk Middle School. I presently am an Administrator at the Community College of Baltimore County (CCBC). I served as a former K- 12 substitute teacher in BCPS. I am a community organizer who developed mentoring programs in local BCPS middle schools.  With a vested interest and extensive experience connecting with the needs of the constituency, stakeholders, educators and legislators, I am the most suited to unify, leading the voice of our district upon the board of education. My voice and vote will be to fight for continuing resource investments in 1) our students, teachers and parents 2) emphasize infrastructural development 3) ensure the public safety of schools to ensure optimized conditions for learning","Technology is a powerful tool which has reduced barriers of access and accelerated the dissemination of information in our world today. We must continue to support our students with technologies that enhance knowledge acquisition, and promote positive performance outcomes in an efficient way.  We must engage in a better process of no- bid contracts, to ensure sustainability and accountability in the fiscal management of tech associated expenditures. We must manage this tool from a scope of balance and sensibility that ultimately will lead to strategic investments.  Human centered approaches to technology will be embraces as resources to support the needs of the education sector. Yet my position is clear, Technology was never meant to take the place of humans.","Honestly no.  System's resources have not always been fairly and equitably divided. It been said the squeaky wheel gets the oil, or in this case the affluent areas.  In the southeast of Baltimore County, we have lacked the resources. With a vested interest and extensive experience connecting with the needs of the constituency, stakeholders, educators and legislators, I am the most suited to unify, leading the voice of our district upon the board of education.   There are special populations within the school system that are growing at a disproportionate rate. Immigrant students taking English as a Second Language programs, are making up a growing segment of Baltimore County Students. In addition, the greater emphasis on early diagnosis has warranted a growing population of students with special needs and an expanded range of services required. Increased funding in those areas has helped, but not completely met the needs of the student caseloads that have drastically outpaced the budgetary constraints. In a jurisdiction of great diversity, I am an advocate for equity and supporting vulnerable populations. More staff is needed in those areas as well as in general education classrooms so all students can be fully engaged in their learning.","The conditions surrounding this case, allows an opportunity for us to reflect not attack. Our systemic design can be improved to ensure the ethical integrity of our system.  Demonstrating transparency and accountability, ensures the respectable stewardship of the institution unto the populous. More analysis must be done on our system to prevent issues from transpiring in the future.","In an era of a lack of accountability and poor performance management there is an opportunity to implement best practices, examining standard measures in the field and audit fiscal expenditures to ensure quality assurance is optimized and any issues are addressed in an expedient manner. Ensuring ethical oversight of the school funds is necessary to determine spending aligns with strategic endeavors. Clearly, the current audit system failed to work with the recent scandal. I think it is incumbent on the new Board of Education to look at potential modifications, like bringing in an external auditor and/or providing accountability in oversight of the school systems fiscal operations. This is a platform that will support the consistent evaluation of our systems and policies to ensure ethical practices in the field.","As one of the Conduct Administrator at CCBC I understand clearly that there are rarely perfect outcomes.  In adjudicating cases, the primary goal should be taking a balanced approach that is student centered, and committed to creating conditions suitable for the academic environment. Protecting our teachers and students are a forthright priority.  I hold clear strategic directions for disciplinary issues which may arise. While standard operating procedures are generally appropriate, more needs to be done to take the onus off of classroom teachers and hold each entity accountable for their role in the educational environment. That is why I support hiring more professionals to handle behavior and discipline problems outside of the classroom, thus demonstrating our commitment to classroom teachers to educate, not discipline.","Common Core and PARCC exams have serves as instruments indicative of the outcomes movement in the field of education. There is clearly a need to have standard measures and assessment tools to ensure our students are college ready upon graduation. I am a supporter of systems that are designed to structure performance and accountability measures in a manner that is sustainable in settings of academia. I think what is key is the timing of the roll out of exams to ensure a seamless implementation process. Part of the education process is learning where our students' deficiencies are and creating a system of implementation that allows educators to gradually phase in standard assessments. It is imperative to recognize the deficiencies of our children, and the primary form of doing this is through mandated testing. We have a responsibility to ensure we are improving their education but we need a baseline measure to effectively do this. I am not for additional testing, but the resources we have must be utilized and implemented in a strategic fashion.","Diversity can be viewed from many different angles and I am a supporter of exposing our students to transformational education through diverse experiences. In relation to attendance zone lines, it is my assertion that zoning is tied to socio-economic and tax based jurisdictions. I believe in protecting the interests of our jurisdictions and ensuring that our institutions are reflective of the communities surrounding them.","There should no longer be a debate regarding the conditions of schools who date back to the 1950s.   It is now time to prioritize our inventory of schools, repair and reconstruct institutions of learning with integrity, demonstrating ethical stewardship of taxpayer's funds in a transparent manner. We cannot produce leaders of tomorrow in schools that are outdated.",Why do you want to serve on the county school board?,Has the county’s use of educational technology in the classroom been appropriate?

Considering the current issues and trends in education that we are witnessing as a nation, it is imperative we acknowledge and take action to support the movement for safety in our schools lead by our students.  It is vitally important that our students, teachers, parents and community partners continue all efforts to ensure excellent overall achievement for each student to compete globally, and I am running to serve as that catalyst. In essence, I am running to be of service and assist with the promotion of education in each community in Baltimore County.",Technology plays an integral role in preparing students to compete globally and ensuring that all  21st century learners  are technologically literate.  A review of expenditures for technology will need to be a process to align it with additional budgetary items.,"Resources, staffing plans and school operation funding allocations are based on projected enrollment numbers. Reviewing resources to provide adequate support should be in place to ensure optimal learning opportunities for all students. Additional supports and resources are needed to address the changing demographics of a projection of over 100,000 students.","Transparency, both professionally and personally is required and Board oversight to include that all required documents of the superintendent are completed accurately with full disclosure. To ensure adequate oversight the following measures could be adhered to: Implementation of a financial tracking system to review financial disclosure statements Require a bi-annual submission and review  of financial disclosure statements   Review of compliance with ethics agreements by the Ethics Committee to include at least one State Legislative Auditor  Full disclosure is to be addressed by all parties to ensure compliance,","There is a need to review and revise with absolute clarity for ethics, conflicts of interest and full financial disclosure.","The Baltimore County Board of Education, has established in the Student Handbook, the Code of Conduct, with the expectation that students will adhere to while on school property and in school sponsored activities. The school discipline policies are systemic and address the varied areas of discipline.  The current use of restorative education practices, with Response to Intervention model are examples of additional areas to school discipline. As discipline problems arise, there may be future implications for change.","Common Core and PARCC exams were developed for common academic standards for all students regardless of where they live, are graduating high school prepared for college, life experiences and careers. Providing the balance of testing and teaching continues to be an issue with a number of stakeholders. Assessments that assist with the identification of student achievement, improve education outcomes for all students, and serve as a tool to guide instruction for results is relevant to education.",Traditional neighborhood school zones are based on population and proximity. Drawing new school zone lines should focus on community growth.,"School construction and renovations are significant needs and priorities in Baltimore County. A review of current data, with the initiatives outlined in the 1.3 billion-dollar Schools for our Future, school renovation and construction plan  would assist with recommendations for more efficient and effective schools. Adequate funding will continue to be warranted to meet the needs of each student within each community in Baltimore County.        0%",Why do you want to serve on the county school board?,Has the county’s use of educational technology in the classroom been appropriate?

,YES,baltimore-county/board-of-education,1,Richard M. Young,Young,6/28/1955,Catonsville,Non-Partisan,"Bachelor of Science (Sociology/Psychology) degree from SUNY, Albany, NY.   Master's Certification in Social Studies from UMBC.","I am a retired US Army Master Sergeant.   I transitioned from the Army to the ""Troops to Teacher's"" program in 1995 at UMBC and I worked as a teacher for BCPS  & CCBC for over 15 years up to 2010. I am now a Retired Teacher from the State of Maryland.",(410) 804-8350,ryoung21228@hotmail.com,,RichardYoung,,,"I have always been an advocate for education. My children (2 daughters) graduated from Lansdowne High. My youngest daughter went on to graduate from the Veterinary College at Iowa State. My oldest  daughter graduated from Salisbury University and received a scholarship to Graduate school at the University of Oklahoma.  I want to ""Make BCPS Great Again"". BCPS has 23 recognized Blue Ribbon schools BUT on the other hand has TOO many failing schools. There is NO EQUITY in BCPS. The failing schools have not received the adequate resources to improve their student's futures. I want to offer solutions to help fix EVERY school in BCPS.  BCPS provides equality per school based on numerical formulas, but it does not provide EQUITY. Many schools need more resources other than those resources offered by BCPS according to their formulas. I also hope to change the ""culture of fear"" currently experienced by the students of BCPS  but ALSO for the teachers and administrators in BCPS.  People are afraid to say what the problems are in BCPS. Those that do speak out "" fear"" retaliation. I want to grant the administrator's of the schools more autonomy in deciding how its school problems are addressed. I also want to amend many policies of BCPS especially in the areas of Discipline and Grading. Too many incidents of violent behavior is going unchecked in our schools. Too many ""NOT PREPARED"" for ""College OR Anything""  students graduate because of the current LS and no grading homework policies in place.","I will give credit to Dr. Dance for ""dragging"" BCPS into the 21st century. Now EVERY students and EVERY teacher can utilize a computer in their classes. However the launching of this initiative should have began at the high school level. There was a rush to judgement to have STAT's 1:1 ratio in the elementary schools. The ratio of 3:1 would reduced the number of computers by 30,000 and would have allowed a faster implementation in every school. As it is, we only had 3 Lighthouse high schools this year. The high school teachers have not received adequate training by the STAT teachers. So the use of technology was inappropriate IMO because of lack of foresight by both the Board and the Superintendent. The savings from having 30,000 less computers in the ES would have saved $30 million dollars desperately needed for replacement schools throughout the county. The lack of oversight of the technological expenditures cost BCPS another $100 million dollars. The original Daly contract was for $205 million I believe and BCPS has now committed over $340 million. This lack of accountability of our county tax dollars is inexcusable.","The resources appear to be fairly divided but they're not. Kevin Kamenetz  has proposed a 3rd NEW high school near Towson but NOT 1 new high school in Southwest Baltimore County. ""Chevy"" renovations are good enough for the Southwest. But they built 2 new elementary and 1 new middle school in District 1.  The cost of those 3 new schools in District 1  only equaled the cost of the ONE new high school in District 3 (G.W. Carver). BCPS is going to build 2 MORE new high schools in the  Towson area? That's politics, not EQUITY. District 1 has the most over crowded elementary xchools in BCPS (currently +850 students). These are the future students for most of the middle schools and high schools in District 1 and NO planning that I can see is in place to accommodate future over crowding. BCPS estimates for the past 2 decades have been incorrect and ill planned. They build the new schools too late thus resulting in the over crowding. And the majority of BCPS failures have been in the under-served areas where the majority of the minority and low-income students have attended over-crowded schools their entire academic career in BCPS. We need EQUITY and we need it now. The priorities of BCPS are being driven by politics and they always have been. And now we have corruption in the mix too. What a shame. What a disappointment for the GREAT citizens of Baltimore County.","A buyout clause needs to be in every contract. If the candidate doesn't like the offer then move on to the next candidate. I believe that if through the actions of a Superintendent that the Board of Education would have a vote of confidence and should have an opportunity to exercise that buyout clause, annually or upon request by the candidate. There also should be a penalty for early resignation by the Superintendent for breach of contract. I will not comment about Superintendent White. That issue has been resolved. I am not a fan of her appointment nor of the behavior on the part of the majority of the board who approved her appointment.","The Ethics panel system seems to be working because of the due diligence of certain board members. I am glad to finally see a new contract that explicitly bans ANY extra monies for the Superintendent. I would like to see the same ban for many of the BCPS offices that deal with businesses. The Board must stay alert of future illegal activities and the system needs an independent top to bottom review for waste, fraud and abuse. Meaning I would support and ask for an external audit of BCPS and implement its recommendations, if any.","The students do not feel safe. The schools are not safe. The violence in the schools is not be reported and in many cases, the violators are returned to the same class the same day. This has to STOP. The ambiguities in the discipline policies of BCPS (i.e. MAY result in) need to be addressed. REAL weapons and threats that are perceived to have REAL merit MUST result in immediate suspensions, until their hearings are held. Many teachers are fed up with the noncompliance by the administration to address the seemingly daily incidents of violence in many Baltimore County schools. Learning vannot occur in a disorderly atmosphere and teaching cannot occur when discipline is not being enforced. As a former BCPS teacher, these rules are sacrosanct.  Zero tolerance for ANY dangerous students. Our children lives are at stake. BCPS needs to review its numbers and placements of its PPW and other social workers throughout the entire system. If we need more than HIRE them.","I support Common Core. Common Core has been adopted by over 40 states. I do not support PARCC. Maryland made a big mistake with PARCC and is now considering alternative measuring devices and tests for literacy and math. We need some standardized measuring method throughout a child's educational career in BCPS other than teacher's grades and tests. BCPS graduates too many unprepared students and does not ready them for the real world experiences they are about to face. PARCC scores, or for that matter, ANY standardized test scores should NOT be used as a graduation requirement for students AND shall NOT be used for teacher's evaluations IMO.","Diversity should be a consideration but not a factor. We have many segregated communities in Baltimore County. But these are community schools as well as magnet schools. Children who are capable should be given a fair opportunity to attend any magnet school that they choose. We have some magnet schools holding lorreries for the seats but are NOT at full capacity. That makes no sense at all. Since we have segregated neighborhoods, we're bound to have some highly segregated schools. I do not want to see BCPS students being bussed around Baltimore County to achieve some vague goal such as diversity. It cannot be forced upon anyone. It will occur on its own accord.","I have a 3 tier plan for priorities of school construction. Separate all the ES, MS and HS construction plans and prioritize them separately. Use the capitalization/utilization inspection scores as part of each school's score for priority. We must also consider over-crowding as a priority too. Then develop a 10 year construction/maintenance projection plan. Prioritize each category of schools and then consult, confer and allow the Board of Education to determine the order and prioritization of the projects. This 10 year plan will be reviewed EVERY year and if needed, adjusted every year according to the needs (NOT THE WANTS) for each school AND community. Remember there are many more elementary schools than MS and HS combined.",Why do you want to serve on the county school board?,Has the county’s use of educational technology in the classroom been appropriate?
