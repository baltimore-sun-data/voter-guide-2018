They give greater rights to transnational corporations to sue our government if our new laws interfere with their ability to make profits in a trade tribunal that supersedes even our Supreme Court. Veolia, a French corporation that operates in Maryland, sued Egypt over a new law to raise its minimum wage. We cannot allow transnational corporations to exploit workers. Baltimore has been hurt enough by agreements like the North American Free Trade Agreement that cost us our steel industry. We cannot trade away our rights. All of our trade agreements have worsened the trade deficit, rather than helping. They enrich those at the top and hurt smaller businesses and farms. Studies of the TPP show that it will have a negligible positive effect on our Gross Domestic Product over the next ten years and may actually reduce GDP. The TPP will worsen wealth inequality.

An improved Medicare for all will reduce our health spending while covering everyone with comprehensive benefits. It will end bankruptcies due to medical costs.

I have already pledged to support the 19-step plan created by financial crime experts and whistleblowers that would mostly use existing laws to rein in corruption. It would also reduce the size of the too-big-to-fail banks. I would go further to promote financial institutions that serve the public good rather than Wall Street. Like the state of North Dakota, Maryland and other states could create public banks that would serve local needs for infrastructure and investment in businesses. And we can add banking services to the United States Postal Service to meet the needs of those without access to bank accounts.

Unfortunately, many of the problems driving these movements have not yet been solved. We need leadership in the White House and Congress that are willing to take on the wealthy interests and promote policies that meet the needs of the people and protect the planet.

    "q7p1":"<P>Families and individuals in the United States should have enough income to be able to meet their basic necessities. There are a number of steps that can be taken to accomplish this. A first step would be to look at the reality of the cost of living and raise the federal poverty level to reflect this. There should be a federal minimum wage that is tied to the cost of living in each area and that rises with inflation. Workers should be able to earn a living wage and have paid sick and family leave as well as vacation time. Families have emergencies and workers should not have to fear losing their job when they need time to deal with those emergencies. When workers are sick, they should be able to stay home and recover, especially when they have contagious illnesses. Families need time for recreation in order to be healthy. I would go even farther than a minimum wage to work towards a guaranteed basic income for all people. Instead of public dollars being used to subsidize the profits of big industries, those dollars should be viewed as a public investment with a public return similar to the Alaska Permanent Fund. A universal basic income would eliminate poverty and the need for many poverty programs. This would begin to correct the inequality between workers and capital that has driven the growing wealth divide over the past 50 years.</p>",

Changes will need to be made to reduce access to guns by people who would use them to kill others or themselves, either intentionally or by accident, and to reduce the socio-economic factors that lead to violent crimes. Congress should regulate the sales of all guns and require universal background checks. Assault weapons and magazines that can carry a large number of rounds should be banned in the US, and this should be combined with a program to buy these back. All gun owners should be licensed and required to take basic gun safety courses or to otherwise demonstrate competence. This should include how to store guns so that children do not have easy access to them. And there should be mandatory reporting of gun thefts to law enforcement. Additionally, Congress should promote policies that curtail the socio-economic factors such as poverty, the failed drug war and lack of access to mental health treatment that drive gun violence towards others and oneself.</p>",

We need to hold elections in an open and transparent way so that results are reliable and can be verified.

Without an agreement, the Iranians would immediately revert to their status as a threshold nuclear weapons state.

However, big, multilateral trade deals like NAFTA and CAFTA, which I opposed, have contributed to job loss and flat wages.

Our efforts must also ensure that we protect and expand access to credit, particularly by cracking down on discrimination and redlining. We also need to focus on income inequality, which threatens our economy and leaves too many Americans feeling like they are stuck in place. Our economy needs to work for everyone.

I also support universal background checks and reinstating federal bans on high-capacity magazines and assault weapons to prevent easy criminal access to dangerous firearms.

There should be a federal minimum wage that is tied to the cost of living in each area and that rises with inflation. Workers should be able to earn a living wage and have paid sick and family leave as well as vacation time. Families have emergencies and workers should not have to fear losing their job when they need time to deal with those emergencies. When workers are sick, they should be able to stay home and recover, especially when they have contagious illnesses. Families need time for recreation in order to be healthy. I would go even farther than a minimum wage to work towards a guaranteed basic income for all people. Instead of public dollars being used to subsidize the profits of big industries, those dollars should be viewed as a public investment with a public return similar to the Alaska Permanent Fund.

To make matters worse, this seems to be the case of the US imposing lesser standards on other countries as the USTR's 2014 SPS report complains about standards for GE food abroad hurting our exports (standards of sanitation are higher elsewhere).

They also acknowledge that a wage set too high may substantially affect overall employment.</p><p>How high is too high? The current number suggested is $15, which translates into approximately ~$27,000/yr, barely above poverty for a family of four.

The proof is in the results, not the President's rhetoric. The United States must completely destroy ISIS, their supply lines, their funding sources and their safe bases, and as your Senator, you can count on me to fully support, authorize and fund such a strategy.</p>",
    "q3p1":"There are many steps we must take to make America competitive again and bring our jobs home from China. The first is to reduce corporate taxes from the highest to the lowest in the developed world, and to allow for easier repatriation of foreign income. We must cut regulations so America is the easiest country to start and run a business, rather than being a nightmare of regulations that by themselves strangle small and large businesses alike. </p>",
    "q3p2":"<p>The power to set trade policy is the Constitutional responsibility of Congress, yet Fast Track and many trade treaties have surrendered much of that responsibility. We must not allow trade partners and adversaries unfair access to our markets while they protect their own, and treaties are blind to slave and sweatshop labor. China demands the surrender of high technology and 51% of your company to China, yet the U.S. does not effectively enforce treaty violations or even currency manipulation.</p><p>If you would like to see the proof of the \"Perfect Storm\" effects of these destructive tax, trade and regulatory policies, I encourage you to go to Sparrows Point, and count the employees working there today.</p><p>The theory that cheap imported products would make us more prosperous failed. I witness these tragic consequences each time I have walked the war-like ruins of Baltimore's manufacturing centers—not far from where I grew up and as a boy marveled at the huge factories employing my boyhood neighbors making Chevys, ships and steel.</p>",
    "q4p1":"Just one thing? Easy: repeal Obamacare. On my first day in office, I will introduce legislation to repeal the entire Obamacare law, and to replace it with workable and affordable market-based solutions, which will allow you to see the doctors you want, get the care you need, end 'death panels' and allow doctors to spend their time helping save lives, not filling out government paperwork. Socialized medicine has never worked, but results in massive tax hikes, long waits for care, death panels, and misery. </p>",
    "q4p2":"<P>Canada can dump patients to American hospitals when their government system is overburdened, but where would we go once we have government hospitals, doctors, nurses, and more restrictions than pages in the tax code? Mexico? Obama's Obamacare, and full Socialized medicine schemes from Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders will put the nails in the coffin of genuinely affordable care from your own doctor.</p>",
    "q5p1":"I will work to repeal the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act--which did not resolve the problems that created the 2008 crisis, and has forced many small banks to close, destroying the local banking sector. Dodd-Frank, imposed huge costs on the financial system, causing a terribly slow recovery from the recession. Without these additional costs and restrictions, we could have the kind of economic growth, investment, and job creation we had in the 1980s, when Reagan reduced regulation and taxes and freed the economy to grow.</p>",
    "q5p2":"<p>I will also repeal the 1990 Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act, and end the 1992 housing affordability regulations, as well as the Community Reinvestment Act. I would also privatize Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. </p><p>With a 5% growth rate, our cities would take off in an economic resurgence that will bring new and better jobs for all. This cannot happen without tax, regulatory and legislative policies which maximize economic growth.</p>",
    "q6p1":"President Obama may be one of the most effective presidents in many decades—for implementing his radical agenda, but he is a failure in responsibly leading the greatest nation in the world to prosperity and security. </p>",
    "q6p2":"<p>His legacy of failed leadership for Americans includes doubling the national debt in just eight years, massive unemployment numbers which are masked only because tens of millions gave up on finding a job. </p><p>Obama's legacy is our unsecured border and the millions of illegal immigrants and increasing numbers of un-screened refugees.</p><p>His legacy includes the betrayed promise of Obamacare where you can't keep your doctor or plan, the Iran deal and the accompanying $100 billion gift to finance their nuclear program, support for radical Islamist regimes in the wake of the Arab Spring, and turning his back on our allies including Israel. It also includes assaults on American's right to keep and bear arms, and allowing our Veterans' health care system to decay to catastrophic levels.</p><p>The President's legacy includes the collapse of American influence in the world, and the resulting power vacuum being filled at terrifying cost by Iran, ISIS, Al Qaeda, China, Russia and North Korea. In this power vacuum, civilization itself is dying with each terrorist attack and each advance by the forces of terror and tyranny.</p><p>President Obama must be held accountable for his inaction and actions on each of these failures of his responsibilities and Constitutional duties.</p>",
    "q7p1":"Have you seen the new \"$15 an hour\" workers? I have, and I bet you have too. The automated kiosks at fast food restaurants that take your order without so much as a friendly \"hello.\" The parking lot attendant machines that won't keep an eye on your car or give you directions. The \"press 1 for directions, 2 for Spanish, and 3 for yet another recorded message\" receptionist robots. </P>",
    "q7p2":"<p>What's missing are the people. What's missing are the youth who depend on starter jobs to get valuable experience to build their career. </p><p>Historically, minimum wage hikes and other government-mandated employment costs always cost jobs—and the first to be fired are the least-skilled. Is that the future you want? Robots taking all the 'unskilled' jobs because the cost of building a machine that works 24/7 is cheaper than hiring a real human being? </p><p>Let's let the market set pay rates, not arbitrary government edicts that always fill the unemployment department and welfare office waiting lines—and encourage replacing people with robots.</p>",
    "q8p1":"Marylanders have too often been the victim of murder, assault and armed robbery, and the police cannot be at your side when crimes are committed. I support nationwide and reciprocal concealed and open carry, and an end to gun control laws which have only robbed citizens of the ability to save lives. </p>",
    "q8p2":"<p>I will work to end illegal immigration and admitting unscreened refugees which are creating new waves of violent crime. I am proud to fully support the Second Amendment. </p><p>I also support a reform of self-defense laws, so those who defend themselves, their families and property—or defend you at a terrorist shooting--need not worry that they, rather than the criminals, will face prosecution.</p><p>It is a tragic fact that many mass-murderers have selected 'gun free zones' for their killing sprees, yet the only people who obey those cute signs are the law-abiding—the ones standing next to you that you wish were armed in the event of a terror or murder assault. Americans must have their Constitutional right to self-defense restored so they may save the lives of themselves, families—and perhaps one day save your life too.</p><p>With terrorism on the rise, it is even more essential that we empower law-abiding citizens to shoot back. Our police must be allowed to do their jobs without fear that maintaining law and order will land them, not the criminals in prison.</p>",
    "q9p1":"I challenge any child to look at a map of Maryland's Congressional districts and not be able to identify a few dragons, dinosaurs and other creatures from fantasy books. Is that how we should draw the lines? </p>",
    "q9p2":"<p>Democrats have twisted our district lines to perpetuate their single-party-rule of Maryland, and I fully support Governor Hogan's initiative to reform the process. </p><p>Redistricting is a state, not Federal responsibility, and should never be conducted by bureaucrats in Washington.</p>",
    "q10p1":"As your Senator, there are many actions I can take to help bring prosperity back to Baltimore and other cities in crisis.</P>",
    "q10p2":"<p>I will investigate the Federal barriers to starting and running a business. A terrifying maze of regulations snares every employer, and I will introduce legislation to deregulate businesses so they may again be competitive in the world. Enterprise zones can be a terrific way to cut through regulations and taxes, but better yet would be to make everywhere in America an enterprise zone. Simply, getting government out of the way can herald a renaissance in economic development in America.</p><p>Our economy is additionally burdened by having the highest corporate taxes in the developed world, making any other country more attractive in this global economy. I will lead legislative efforts to cut this tax burden as well as encourage the repatriation of foreign income.</p><p>I invite you to join me to make America—and Maryland great and prosperous again.</p>",
    "q11p1":"I believe our nation has been diminished in so many ways during the presidency of Barack Obama. Marylanders and indeed all Americans deserve far better, however the fundamental problems were caused by rather than being fixed by Washington and Annapolis insiders and the political class--whether Democrat or Republican. It's time for citizen legislators to unite and help take back our beloved country. </P>",
    "q11p2":"<p>My experience as a successful small businessman, and through my educational and grassroots advocacy organization, Restore America's Mission, has connected me closely to the problems and opportunities in our state, and gave me a powerful bond with the citizens of Maryland. This is a perspective which is not shared by the political class, and the Washington and Annapolis insiders. </p><p>As your Senator, I will work diligently to restore American strength, American credibility, and make real the American dream for everyone. If we cannot restore, protect and defend our economy, our culture, and our national security and borders, we are betraying the present and next generations of Marylanders. This can't be done by the 'go-along, get along' politicians, and that is why I am running for the United States Senate to get big government and big regulations out of our pocketbooks and out of our lives.</p>"
