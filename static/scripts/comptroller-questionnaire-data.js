I also support prohibiting and eliminating all nuclear weapons throughout the world, including in the United States. The U. S. should not spend $1 trillion over the next ten years on upgrading nuclear weapons. Instead, we should use that money for pressing domestic needs and engage in multilateral negotiations with all nuclear weapon states to reach an agreement to ban nuclear weapons. I agree with my physician colleagues who understand the devastation that nuclear weapons can produce and the imperative that we end their threat everywhere.</p>",

    "q2p1":"<p>ISIS is a symptom of the destruction of nations in the Middle East through the United States' failed \"War on Terror\". This has led to chaos in countries like Iraq and Libya that creates an opening for extremists and foments anti-American sentiment. Our first priority should be to cut off ISIS' access to money and to weapons, which are coming from U. S. allies. And our second priority should be to provide basic support to stabilize countries in the Middle East. There is much that needs to be done to restore basic infrastructure and access to energy, food, clean water, education and more. As these states re-stabilize, they will regain the trust of their people and reduce extremism. United States' militarism and intervention is the cause of this problem, not the solution. </p>",

    "q3p1":"<p>TEST I have been actively working for the past five years to stop international agreements like the TransPacific Partnership. Experience with similar treaties over the past twenty years shows that they drive a global race to the bottom in worker rights and wages and protection of the environment. They give greater rights to transnational corporations to sue our government if our new laws interfere with their ability to make profits in a trade tribunal that supersedes even our Supreme Court. Veolia, a French corporation that operates in Maryland, sued Egypt over a new law to raise its minimum wage. We cannot allow transnational corporations to exploit workers. Baltimore has been hurt enough by agreements like the North American Free Trade Agreement that cost us our steel industry. We cannot trade away our rights. All of our trade agreements have worsened the trade deficit, rather than helping. They enrich those at the top and hurt smaller businesses and farms. Studies of the TPP show that it will have a negligible positive effect on our Gross Domestic Product over the next ten years and may actually reduce GDP. The TPP will worsen wealth inequality. It is time to end this failed model of trade and create a new model that lifts up workers and protects the health and safety of our communities and the planet.</p>",

    "q4p1":"<p>The reality is that the Affordable Care Act continues to leave tens of millions of people without insurance and tens of millions more who have insurance but still can't afford health care because of the out-of-pocket costs. I support improving and expanding traditional Medicare to cover everyone, eliminating out-of-pocket costs and broadening coverage to include mental health, dental, vision and long term care without requiring a spend down that drives seniors into poverty. An improved Medicare for all will reduce our health spending while covering everyone with comprehensive benefits. It will end bankruptcies due to medical costs. As a nation, we are already spending enough on health care to accomplish this. It's time that we join the rest of the industrialized nations who treat health care as a public good, not as a commodity for profits.</p>",

    "q5p1":"<p>As anyone who watched \"The Big Short\" knows, the fraudulent behavior that was responsible for the 2008 financial crisis continues unabated. Unlike the Savings and Loan crisis in the 1980's in which there were 30,000 investigations and 1,000 felony convictions, no top level executive responsible for the last crash has been held accountable. I have already pledged to support the 19-step plan created by financial crime experts and whistleblowers that would mostly use existing laws to rein in corruption. It would also reduce the size of the too-big-to-fail banks. I would go further to promote financial institutions that serve the public good rather than Wall Street. Like the state of North Dakota, Maryland and other states could create public banks that would serve local needs for infrastructure and investment in businesses. And we can add banking services to the United States Postal Service to meet the needs of those without access to bank accounts. We are fortunate in Maryland to have The Democracy Collaborative which is providing concrete information about how to build and keep wealth in our communities and reduce the wealth divide. I will do what I can to raise awareness of these positive solutions and assist their implementation.</p>",

    "q1p1":"TEST After thoroughly reviewing the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action and meeting with supporters and opponents of the deal, I concluded that it is the best path toward achieving our goal of ensuring that Iran never obtains a nuclear weapon. It advances the national security interests of the U.S. and our allies, including our partner Israel. Without an agreement, the Iranians would immediately revert to their status as a threshold nuclear weapons state. With the agreement, Iran will have to verifiably reduce its nuclear program and we will have the opportunity to test the Iranians' compliance. However, it is also important to remember that this agreement is focused on Iran's nuclear ambitions. We must continue to work with our friends and allies to constantly contain and confront Iranian aggression in the Middle East.  </p>",

    "q2p1":"Countering the threat of ISIS is a national security priority for the U.S., but we should not bear the burden alone. I support the core pillars of the President's plan to fight ISIS -- the use of American surveillance, intelligence assets, and airpower to support the ground operations of the Iraqi army and Kurdish fighters in Iraq, and strike ISIS military equipment and command and control elsewhere. I also believe we should supply weapons to those groups within Syria, such as the Syrian Kurds, who have fought ISIS, and whose priority is to defeat ISIS.</p>",
    "q2p2":"<p>I have spoken out forcefully against the idea of American troops on the ground in Syria, remembering the lessons of the Iraq War, which I opposed from the start. The removal of Saddam Hussein unleashed clashing sectarian forces that spawned al Qaeda in Iraq -- the parent of ISIS. We should end the 2002 Iraq War Resolution authority and the current version of the 2001 Authorization to Use Military Force, which provides a blank check for the Executive to put U.S. ground combat forces into Iraq, Syria and other areas.</p>",
    "q3p1":"Every trade agreement needs to meet two basic tests - does it improve worker wages and does it add American jobs. I do not support the Trans-Pacific Partnership and voted against Fast Track because it does not meet those requirements, and it would jeopardize critical worker and environmental protections. Exports are an important part of the American economy, and fair trade deals that open new markets for American-made products overseas help the United States. However, big, multilateral trade deals like NAFTA and CAFTA, which I opposed, have contributed to job loss and flat wages. I'm proud that I've been endorsed by the United Auto Workers, who have fought for fair deals and understand that our trade policies have to put American workers first.  </p>",

    "q4p1":"I am proud to have been part of the leadership team that passed the Affordable Care Act, which has lowered costs for families and small businesses across the country, given over 130,000 Marylanders access to health insurance, and ended the worst practices of insurance companies. People with pre-existing conditions can no longer be denied coverage. Annual checkups with your doctor are now free. Insurance companies can no longer charge women more simply because of their gender, and preventive services like mammograms and contraception are offered at no cost. Medicare has been strengthened and the prescription drug donut hole is closing. </p>",
    "q4p2":"<p>The next step is to establish a Public Option to give Americans a Medicare-like choice within the health care exchanges. This would be an important step toward creating a Medicare for All System. We should also work to expand incentives that prioritize the quality of the care people receive over the quantity of care and repeal the so-called \"Cadillac Tax\" to avoid eroding benefits for workers.</p><p>There is still more to do to give working families and seniors better access to quality and affordable prescription drugs. I have long supported efforts to lower drug costs in throughout the health care system including proposals to give Medicare the ability to negotiate drug prices, allow Medicare to receive the same rebates on prescription drugs for low-income beneficiaries that Medicaid receives and to prohibit anticompetitive pay-for-delay agreements.</p>",
    "q5p1":"I am proud that the Wall Street reform package that we passed in the wake of the financial crisis included limits on financial risk-taking and critical investor and consumer protections. The law still must be fully implemented, and we have to fight efforts by those who would roll back the gains we made. </p>",
    "q5p2":"<p>But the system is still out of balance with the middle class getting left behind. We should implement a small financial transaction fee to discourage high-risk trading, address the continuing problem of \"too-big-to-fail\" banks, and ensure that financial speculation does not threaten everyday investors. Our efforts must also ensure that we protect and expand access to credit, particularly by cracking down on discrimination and redlining. We also need to focus on income inequality, which threatens our economy and leaves too many Americans feeling like they are stuck in place. Our economy needs to work for everyone. That's why I've proposed a comprehensive plan to boost the paychecks of working Americans and stop CEOs from getting tax breaks for bonuses if they don't raise wages for rank-and-file employees.</p>"
