      "question": "Should the county develop small area plans as part of the upcoming General Development Plan and Comprehensive rezoning process?",
      "answer": "The county should certainly focus on particular areas that need reinvestment as well as keep their eyes open for the future. We need to ensure our communities are well taken care of, but we also need to facilitate new development, but not at the cost of forgetting about what we have already committed ourselves to (the community that is here now).   As far as dedicating time and resources to develop small area plans, that depends on where, how many, how long, and how much that research and development will cost the county. We are not flush with spare funds and we need to keep a watchful eye on our spending. However, keeping certain areas in mind when generating the Development Plan, potentially even drafting up a few small area plans will be worthwhile and give the community something to look forward to close to home.   By limiting the small area plans to just a handful, we can alleviate some of the additional burdens it would take to make small area plans for every community, while still keeping in line with a focus on specific areas that are desperate need of attention.",

      "question": "The Teachers Association of Anne Arundel County continues to advocate for a return of step increases given up during the 2008 recession. Should the County Council fund these increases?",
      "answer": "The cost of materials for schools keeps increasing, and unfortunately that tends to sap budgets of any wiggle room we may have once had. Personally, I think our teachers are like our farmers, providing the nourishment we need as a society. However, the crops they grow are intangible. Yet, given that we bestow upon them a huge burden to cultivate the minds of our children, we seem to think that their pay should not match their responsibility.   I support a return to step increases based on a time-in-service and performance-based structure. Advancements ought to be meritorious in nature, but we will need to assess as a community, paired in discussion with our teachers and Teachers Association to figure out the best way forward. However, as we spend more in salary, we may need to address some other area of the community's budget to migrate funds over from.  Additionally, this will also mean we need to address first and foremost the issue with pension payments draining the county's general fund. It will be a challenge to get the step increases reinstated, but it is something I am committed to pursuing.",

      "question": "Do you support maximizing revenue under the county tax cap, or seeking additional revenues to support increased spending on education, public safety or other initiatives?",
      "answer": "As many voters in Anne Arundel county, I own my home. Thinking of increasing my tax rate that I pay in addition to the mortgage seems unfathomable. I know that times often get tough and we need to band together as a community to support education (yes, even if we do not have children ourselves) and public safety, and infrastructure. However, we still need to keep in mind not all citizens are going to be able to afford a property tax increase. Not only that citizens may not be able to afford it, it will encourage residents to move to other counties, or even worse, other states if we do not maintain a competitive property tax rate.  If critically necessary, raising the tax rate a fraction, and only temporarily, it could be leveraged in extreme circumstances. However, I am much more a proponent of finding other avenues of income for the county. Those \"other avenues\" will need to be creative and not attack any particular markets unless we want to scare off new, and existing businesses.",
