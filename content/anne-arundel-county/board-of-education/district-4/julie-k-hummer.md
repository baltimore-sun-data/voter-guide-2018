The COLA increases are important because they also increase the starting salary for our new teachers. Currently, AACPS lags behind the other school systems in the Baltimore/Washington area for starting teacher salaries. In order to be competitive in recruiting new teachers, we must raise that beginning salary to match or better the counties around us.",

While SROs provide additional physical protection. just as or perhaps even more so, they become a vital and trusted member of a school community. Students confide in them, providing valuable information on potential situations so that interventions can be taken. The SRO relationship carries over into the community as increased trust and cooperation with law enforcement. We are renovating our schools to have double check in points at the entryway. Additional funds for security could be used to speed up this process. Additional security cameras and upgraded check in systems are also needed, as well as replacement of some classroom doors to models that can be locked from the inside.",

The Board must ensure that the school system is addressing bullying or any unacceptable behavior appropriately according to state laws and guidelines as well as the school system Student Code of Conduct. One of the most important ways the Board can influence this issue is by putting forth a budget that provides for adequate supports for the social and emotional needs of students. Budgets must reflect the need for more school counselors, social workers, psychologists, pupil personnel workers, special educators and ELL teachers; these staff members are the primary front for recognizing and addressing students in need, whether due to bullying, bias motivated behavior, depression, or other mental health issues. The Board must advocate for the resources the schools need.",
