The responsibility of the board is to act as a final arbitrator if a student and/or teacher is punished and they appeal that finding to he Board we either uphold, increase or decrease the punishment. In addition, we will be establishing a series of forums to discuss bullying and other issues to assist parents and students with understanding the process. Finally, the common sense definition of bullying does not meet the definition that the school system has to follow. We are working on more outreach to the community so there is a better understanding of the responsibilities of the Board.
