      "question": "How do you assess the Trump administration so far?",
      "answer": "Trump has failed to reduce taxes and spending, failed to get us out of NATO, and relied on self destructive economic policies like steel tariffs. I would give him an F-.",

    {
      "question": "Do you support or oppose the federal tax cuts passed in 2017? What effect do you believe they will have on the economy?",
      "answer": "I support abolishing the income tax. I want real tax cuts, the kind that leave the government with much less money to carry out pointless wars, the war on drugs, and other foolish government wastes. If elected, I will do everything I can to defund government, eliminate the entire welfare state (including government schools), and abolish the income tax.",
      "shortname": "2017 Tax Cuts"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the level of national debt a concern? What, if anything, should be done to reduce it or constrain its increase?",
      "answer": "Yes. We should massively reduce government spending, specifically by ending the entire welfare state (including government schools), shutting down all foreign military operations, downsizing the military to whatever is necessary for the defense of the United States (not France, Israel, or Saudi Arabia).",
      "shortname": "National debt"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the level of economic inequality in the United States a problem, and if so, what should the federal government do to address it?",
      "answer": "Economic inequality is good. People who prioritize work over leisure have the right to the fruits of that choice. Those who prioritize other things have the right to do so, but should not expect to have the same financial results as those who prioritize work. We have the right to choose our priorities, and the responsibility to face the consequences of those choices.",
      "shortname": "Income inequality"
    },
    {
      "question": "Should federal gun laws be changed, and if so, how?",
      "answer": "Yes. If elected, I will sponsor legislation to repeal all federal gun laws, including laws against automatic weapons. Guns are there to protect citizens from an overreaching government. Our guns should be as powerful as, or more powerful than, anything the government has.",
      "shortname": "Gun laws"
    },
    {
      "question": "What should Congress do with respect to the Affordable Care Act? Should it be strengthened, and if so, how? Should it be scrapped? If so, what if anything should replace it?",
      "answer": "Over the last decades, Lasik, which is a highly complex procedure that involves advanced technology, has gone from costing tens of thousands of dollars to a few hundred dollars per eye. At the same time, the comparatively rudimentary Epi-pen has gone up in price from a hundred dollars to several hundred dollars.   The difference is that Lasik gets no government subsidy. It thrives or fails in the free market. It has to be affordable in order to succeed.   If elected, I will sponsor legislation to end all government involvement in medicine, including the FDA, Medicare, Medicaid, restrictions on residencies, laws that prevent foreign doctors from practicing in America, and laws against importing medicines from abroad.   Today, the best Swiss surgeons cannot practice in America. That needs to change. Today, Americans cannot buy medicines from Japan. That needs to change. Today, companies intentionally drive up prices of care in order to get larger medicare payouts. That needs to stop. Getting government out of healthcare will make it truly affordable.",

    {
      "question": "What role should the federal government play in helping cities like Baltimore?",
      "answer": "Baltimore's blight is a direct consequence of the welfare state. Abolishing the welfare state and ceasing to enable people to have kids they clearly cannot afford is the first step to building the responsibility that will bring back prosperity.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What can Congress do to address the opioid epidemic?",
      "answer": "If elected, I will sponsor legislation to end the war on drugs, release nonviolent users and sellers from prison, and cut taxes accordingly.    Today, the free market helps people break drug addiction through nicotine patches, gums, support groups, etc. The genius of the free market, not the incompetence of government, is what we need to address the opioid epidemic. Government should have zero involvement.",
      "shortname": "Opioids"
    },
    {
      "question": "What changes if any should Congress make to our immigration and deportation laws and policies?",
      "answer": "I support open borders, no welfare. I encourage immigrants to come here, start companies, create jobs, buy products. I absolutely oppose giving any welfare (including government schools) to immigrants or anyone else.",
      "shortname": "Immigration"
    },
    {
      "question": "Should the United States continue with the free trade policies it pursued for the last several decades, or should it enact restrictions in an attempt to help domestic industries?",
      "answer": "I support an end to all trade tariffs, sanctions, and quotas. American companies are the best in the world. and should compete in an open marketplace. Companies that need government help should go out of business.  Weaklings and parasites should not be the foundation of the American economy.",
      "shortname": "Free trade"
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you support the Iran nuclear deal?",
      "answer": "No one wants nuclear proliferation. But consider this: why do so many countries want nuclear weapons? Could it have anything to do with the fact that the U.S. has repeatedly invaded and occupied countries that pose no threat?   To end nuclear demand, we need to stop treating other nations with violence. I support complete withdrawal of all troops, a shutdown of all bases, and an end to all miilitary activity in the Middle East. The way to stop the demand for expensive nuclear weapons is to stop interfering with other nations.",
      "shortname": "Iran"
    },
    {
      "question": "How should the United States address the rise of North Koreaâ€™s nuclear program?",
      "answer": "In the last decades, the U.S. has been engaged in a perpetual war against many, many countries. This \"War on Everyone\" has made other countries justifiably concerned about American invasion. This increases demand for powerful weapons.   If the U.S. government stopped acting as the world's aggressor, countries would no longer want powerful weapons to use against us. We can stop creating enemies through war, and start creating friends through open trade.  As the 9/11 attacks showed, enemies that we create don't need nuclear weapons to destroy lives. We need to stop creating enemies, shut down all foreign military operations, and bring the troops home. I will sponsor legislation to downsize military spending and personnel to the minimum needed for defense of the U.S. only.",
