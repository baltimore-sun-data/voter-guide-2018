      "answer": "I believe that you can not legislate an end to inequality but government is a critical site for struggle and change.

      "shortname": "Income inequality"
    },
    {
      "question": "Should federal gun laws be changed, and if so, how?",
      "answer": "I will support common sense gun control with universal background check, a ban on high capacity magazines and military style assault weapons . The NRA states that \"Guns don't kill people, bad people kill people \" agreed, but we should not easily give bad people access to guns.",

      "question": "What role should the federal government play in helping cities like Baltimore?",
      "answer": "The federal government would need the help of the voters in Baltimore city to vote the democrats who have been running the city for over 40 years out of office. The democrats have successfully cultivated an image of themselves as the protectors of the poor, the fact is the cities in the United States most afflicted by crime, poverty and unemployment have been run for decades by democrats (Baltimore, Detroit, St. Louis, Philadelphia, Trenton, Chicago etc.). We really need to consider other parties when we vote and ask what have we been getting back for our votes? If you only vote for one party, not only will the party you always vote for take you for granted but the other party will completely neglect you.",

    {
      "question": "What can Congress do to address the opioid epidemic?",

    {
      "question": "What changes if any should Congress make to our immigration and deportation laws and policies?",
      "answer": "Immigration is one of the lingering issues that both parties do not have a desire to resolve because they can use immigration to ginger their base during election cycles.

    {
      "question": "Do you support the Iran nuclear deal?",
      "answer": "Yes, I support the Iran nuclear deal because a bad deal is better than no deal. If we tear up the agreement what would motivate North Korea or any other country to enter into agreement with the United States when they know the next administration may cancel the agreement.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How should the United States address the rise of North Koreaâ€™s nuclear program?",

The United States should exhaust every diplomatic solution that is possible and as a last resort military action. The world is currently in disarray because we retreated from our role as the global leader, if we do not police the world then tyrants will begin to either kill their own people or invade other countries.",
