    {
      "question": "What do you consider the greatest accomplishments and failings of the Kamenetz administration?",
      "answer": "I believe the greatest accomplishments are the unprecedented historic school funding to help alleviate overcrowding, combat aging infrastructure, and ensure air conditioning to our schools.",
      "shortname": "Kamenetz record"
    },
    {
      "question": "Does Baltimore County have adequate resources to meet its needs, particularly to renovate or replace aging schools? Do you support increasing the property tax or local income tax?",
      "answer": "It depends on whether we renovate or build new high schools.  All options should be on the table including increasing revenue or decreasing spending.",
      "shortname": "Resources/Taxes"
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you support Baltimore County's federal housing consent decree? In particular, do you support a prohibition on rental discrimination against those who use federal housing vouchers?",
      "answer": "No, I do not support the decree. I believe landlords should decide the tenants. Landlords should be able to use resources like background and credit checks to make an informed decision. Also, I don't think the county has adequate infrastructure nor an adequate code enforcement budget to mitigate the impact of this program should it become law.",
      "shortname": "Housing"
    },
    {
      "question": "Does the county government exercise adequate oversight over the school system?",
      "answer": "No, I would like a county auditor that reports directly to the county council to have more independent oversight of the county school board.",
      "shortname": "School system"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role can the county play in assisting in the preservation or revitalization of aging communities?",
      "answer": "We have been working hard doing exactly that. The county is a catalyst in the preservation and revitalization of our communities. Some note worthy projects that I have helped secure are as follows: Arts and Entertainment district for Southwest Baltimore County, Patapsco Heritage Greenway, Maryland Sustainable Community designation for Catonsville, Paradise and Winterslane.",
      "shortname": "Revitalization"
    },
    {
      "question": "How would you characterize the relationship between the Baltimore County police and the communities they serve? Are any reforms necessary?",
      "answer": "In Southwest Baltimore, we have an exceptional relationship between the police and the community. The community works hand in hand with the police to combat crime. I am proud of the relationship. The Wilkens Police and Community Relations Organization (WPCRO) is an outstanding example of continued diligence. They lead the way with open communication, trust and transparency which is paramount in community police relations.",
      "shortname": "Police"
    },
    {
      "question": "Baltimore County was a pioneer in rural land preservation. Do its zoning policies and the Urban-Rural Demarcation Line continue to serve the county's needs?",
      "answer": "Absolutely yes, zoning policies and the Urban-Rural Demarcation Line continues to serve the county's needs. I helped pass the neighborhood commons zoning designation. Also, we reformed the Planned Unit Development (PUD) process to be more community focused and transparent.",
      "shortname": "Zoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Baltimore County's support for cultural institutions in Baltimore City too little, too much or just right?",
      "answer": "It is imperative for the county and city to work closely especially in regards to our shared cultural institutions. Thousands of county residents enjoy the Zoo, Symphony, and Aquarium among many others. Our mutual well being is closely correlated, if the city does well so will the county. We need to work together to enhance that positive relationship.",
      "shortname": "Baltimore City"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Baltimore County adequately served by mass transit?",
      "answer": "Absolutely not, the decision to walk away from the red line project was a disaster. It most likely cost us Amazon. We cannot keep adding to the beltway. Its not a long term solution.",
      "shortname": "Transit"
