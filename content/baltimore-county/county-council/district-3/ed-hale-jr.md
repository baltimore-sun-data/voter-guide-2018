    {
      "question": "What do you consider the greatest accomplishments and failings of the Kamenetz administration?",
      "answer": "I believe the Kamenetz administration has done an adequate job keeping the U.R.D.L. in its current location, thus by preserving the North County farmland. The biggest failing has been fiscal responsibility. Baltimore County is dangerously close to maxing out the bonds, thereby leaving the next administration to deal with tough choices that could impact our ability to continue to borrow at low interest rates.",
      "shortname": "Kamenetz record"
    },
    {
      "question": "Does Baltimore County have adequate resources to meet its needs, particularly to renovate or replace aging schools? Do you support increasing the property tax or local income tax?",
      "answer": "Currently, Baltimore County does not have the resources to renovate or rebuild aging schools. The current administration has promised to rebuild Dulaney High School, but the County Council has already stated it will not approve this project due to the county's improper spending. I do not support increasing the property tax, or income tax. If elected, I will work with the other council members to sure up a 10 year plan for new construction and renovations of our aging schools, as well as a preventative maintenance plan, so we can extend the life of our existing schools.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Do you support Baltimore County's federal housing consent decree? In particular, do you support a prohibition on rental discrimination against those who use federal housing vouchers?",
      "answer": "I do not support Baltimore County's federal housing consent decree. By doing this, it removed any legal action that could be taken by our own judges. The citizens of Baltimore County that own rental homes have no one to help and support them when legal decisions are handed down. I believe in growing our economy so less people need federal housing vouchers by earning competitive salaries in the work place.",
      "shortname": "Housing"
    },
    {
      "question": "Does the county government exercise adequate oversight over the school system?",
      "answer": "No, especially in light of the issues we are now faced with because of Dr. Dance, it is clear that we need more accountability in our school system.",
      "shortname": "School system"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role can the county play in assisting in the preservation or revitalization of aging communities?",
      "answer": "In certain areas of the county where preserving an aging community is warranted, the county can classify the area or community as \"Historic\". This allows for certain revitalizations to be permitted and some funding is available for assistance.",
      "shortname": "Revitalization"
    },
    {
      "question": "How would you characterize the relationship between the Baltimore County police and the communities they serve? Are any reforms necessary?",
      "answer": "I believe our police department has a great understanding and working relationships with the communities they serve. In the area where I live, they are extremely helpful, and professional. I think the people who wear the Baltimore County Police badge are the best, and would put them up against any other municipality, and they would win.",
      "shortname": "Police"
    },
    {
      "question": "Baltimore County was a pioneer in rural land preservation. Do its zoning policies and the Urban-Rural Demarcation Line continue to serve the county's needs?",
      "answer": "I believe they do. Baltimore County has some of the oldest zoning laws in the country. Many other states have modeled their own laws off of Baltimore County's. I will continue to make sure the zoning policies remain in the North County.",
      "shortname": "Zoning"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Baltimore County's support for cultural institutions in Baltimore City too little, too much or just right?",
      "answer": "Culture is vital for all societies. Baltimore County supports many cultural programs in the city, which is a good thing. I believe the county does enough with the city.",
      "shortname": "Baltimore City"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Baltimore County adequately served by mass transit?",
      "answer": "Yes the county had adequate mass transit. The Light Rail is a vital tool in North County, but is under utilized. I plan to use it as a tool to lure business into our part of the county.",
      "shortname": "Transit"
