      "question": "What do you consider the greatest accomplishments and failings of the Kamenetz administration?",
      "answer": "As with every political administration, there are strengths and weaknesses. I respect County Executive Kamenetz for serving Baltimore County. The county executive added more funding for a consecutive amount of years to the County school budget to rebuild and renovate schools .  Some of the failings have been the attempted sale of school property to a retail developer. The resulting attempted sale relocated a police department and threatened to pave over a large recreational space. The community fought back against it and sale was halted by the state . The executive seemed to lose touch with some less affluent communities in the county with some of the administration's actions .",

In the event more funds would be required to satisfy commitments then a current spending audit and budgetary funds surplus in other agencies would be considered.
