      "question": "What do you consider the greatest accomplishments and failings of the Kamenetz administration?",
      "answer": "I believe his greatest accomplishment throughout his political career is his ability to be both elected and continually re-elected. His greatest failings, like all career politicians, are what he has been willing to do to become elected and the subsequent compromise in representation he visits upon the average citizen taxpayer as a result.",

    {
      "question": "Does Baltimore County have adequate resources to meet its needs, particularly to renovate or replace aging schools? Do you support increasing the property tax or local income tax?",
      "answer": "On paper the resources may be there, but our politicians traditionally play Jenga with all infrastructure, not just schools. They habitually divert money or outright siphon it off to projects that benefit their political operatives and careers until the system can be depleted no more. In response to declining services and eroding infrastructure, the frustrated voter seeks a candidate willing to fall on the sword to fix it — often by raising taxes. The public then faces the other side of this coin: dismayed at the price tag of not only maintaining but also simultaneously restoring the infrastructure, the taxpayer reacts like a rat in a cage — with only two parties to choose from, they without fail will re-elect the same people that depleted the system, this time running on a cost-saving platform, thus perpetuating the vicious cycle. The question is not more or less taxes; it is responsible taxes with honest oversight of the public trust.",

    {
      "question": "Do you support Baltimore County's federal housing consent decree? In particular, do you support a prohibition on rental discrimination against those who use federal housing vouchers?",
      "answer": "In principle, from a legal liability position for the county, I support the decree... I understand it. Nonetheless, regardless of how citizens fund their housing or have their housing funded, I am not a fan of rental properties, vouchers, and/or subsidies as a way of life. Living wage jobs for people of all levels of education, aptitude, and IQ is what makes housing attainable and affordable and creates strong communities. Living wage jobs allow people to purchase on their own behalf and develop the mindset of being invested in a neighborhood, which stabilizes their community at large and eliminates the need for subsidies or decrees to keep housing attainable and affordable in the first place.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Does the county government exercise adequate oversight over the school system?",
      "answer": "The school system, representing approximately half of the county budget, has itself become an industry where people seek employment making a living wage to prepare students for living wage jobs that do not exist. Baltimore County needs more living wage jobs for people of all education levels. This creates greater family investment and community involvement in the schools systems through greater citizen at-large input and feedback. Residents that have strong ties to an economically thriving community will take a lead role and serve as the best facilitators of a strong education for their children. A well run school system is made up of administration, faculty, students, and parents collectively.",
      "shortname": "School system"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role can the county play in assisting in the preservation or revitalization of aging communities?",
      "answer": "Even more so than good schools, fostering and maintaining the safest, most crime-free living environment possible will draw people to build, invest, and renovate. When this is incentivized by strong public safety policies and services, the community members will reflexively and collectively build a strong community association in conjuction with the thriving economy that is stimulated by revitalization. Likewise, the public and private schools, homes, and businesses in these areas will be of highest priority to the community residents who will take a more active role in improving every aspect of the community exponentially.",

      "question": "How would you characterize the relationship between the Baltimore County police and the communities they serve? Are any reforms necessary?",

    {
      "question": "Baltimore County was a pioneer in rural land preservation. Do its zoning policies and the Urban-Rural Demarcation Line continue to serve the county's needs?",
      "answer": "Zoning is always a contentious issue, but certainly Baltimore County has a very good format in place for addressing these issues. The challenge remains to empower more honest people to preside over these forums, processes, proposals, and their associated issues.",

    {
      "question": "Is Baltimore County's support for cultural institutions in Baltimore City too little, too much or just right?",
      "answer": "None of the above. Rather, from my perspective Baltimore County does not have a well defined cultural support system.",
      "shortname": "Baltimore City"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Baltimore County adequately served by mass transit?",
      "answer": "The question is: does our current mass transit have any appeal other than to people that have zero alternative but to rely on it as their sole means of commuting? The answer is a huge NO! In many other countries, mass transit is clean, safe, inexpensive, convenient, and thus is utilized by people of all backgrounds and financial means. Fostering a public transit system of that caliber would be not just a self-funding endeavor, but a profitable one.",
