      "question": "What do you consider the greatest accomplishments and failings of the Glassman administration?",
      "answer": "Mr. Glassman has restored some of the promised pay increases to Harford County teachers that the previous executive cut.  But there needs to be a stronger commitment from local government to both listen to and adequately resource the teachers and staff in our public schools.  Under Mr. Glassman, Harford has retained its agricultural heritage and rural areas , which is an aspect very many of us enjoy and appreciate  - open fields, farmers' markets, and walking trails.  I believe we need stronger leadership in planning for and ensuring a healthy, sustainable environment in the decades to come, to include strong protections for our streams, air,  and open spaces,  as well as growing \"green\" jobs in Harford that will help both the environment and the economy.",

    {
      "question": "Does Harford County have adequate resources to meet its needs, particularly in the funding of public schools and law enforcement?",
      "answer": "If we make schools and law enforcement priorities, I am certain we can resource them adequately.  Harford is fiscally sound, but where we direct funds depends on what citizens and their representatives in government feel are the most important issues to address.  The county could do a better job of including public comment to bills, including the budget, before they are voted on.  Notice of council and budget meetings could be better advertised to allow more interested residents to attend.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Have the county’s land use policies adequately balanced growth and the preservation of existing communities and agricultural land?",
      "answer": "Agricultural preservation has local support, and the development envelope has been the designated \"growth zone\" for decades.  However, the county does not do an adequate job of giving notice of proposed development to allow public comments.  HarfordNEXT is a good step toward providing a way for residents to comment on future plans on a variety of topics, including development and open space, but it has not yet proven to be effective in influencing decisions and has not generated as much input as anticipated.  The county needs to offer residents more ways to be part of the process and create more interest in giving input to the policies and planning that will shape Harford's future for generations.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How do you rate the county’s efforts to fight opioid addiction overdoses? What else, if anything, should the county be doing to combat the epidemic?",
      "answer": "The opioid epidemic is a complex issue that all too many communities face today and needs health care experts to help provide solutions.  Addiction requires treatment, so every overdose incident should be followed up to ensure treatment, family counseling, and long-term monitoring are provided.  To be truly effective, rehabilitation needs to address not just addiction but related issues that could lead to relapse.  Suing drug manufacturers as a county may or may not be an effective tactic, but it will not address the current crisis.  We need education at all levels, in school and in the community, to recognize addiction and how to seek help for oneself and for others.  We also need health care providers to offer options for pain management other than opioids, including medical marijuana.",

    {
      "question": "How would you characterize the relationship between the Harford County Sheriff’s Office and the communities it serves? Are any reforms necessary?",
      "answer": "The Sheriff's Office has a good relationship with Harford communities in that their personnel are trusted to offer professional and timely service to residents in need.  Collective bargaining is long overdue, and that change will help to attract and retain highly professional deputies.",

    {
      "question": "The Glassman administration is trying to lead Harford County’s formerly all-volunteer fire and emergency medical services to more a professional organization with more paid personnel. How do you rate the county’s effort and what should have or could have done differently in this controversial transformation?",
      "answer": "I have not followed the administration's proposal closely so will not give an opinion on this subject.  I believe the volunteer services are very good, but I think that a county of our size, with continued growth, should move to paid professional fire and EMS services.",
