The deterioration and devaluation of the Rt.40 Corridor didn't start under the current administration and it hasn't improved under the current administration.  The Rt. 40 corridor is a major commercial area located within the development envelope. The redevelopment of the corridor is vital to future economic and business growth in Harford County.

  "a2": "Yes, Harford County has adequate resources to meet the needs of funding public schools and law enforcement.  The goal should be to utilize the resources effectively and responsibly while increasing the tax base through economic development and smart growth.

Additionally, Medline Industries is moving from its current location in Harford County to Principio Business Park in Cecil County nearly tripling the company's workforce and adding 200 new jobs.  The Proposed Fiscal Year 2019 Operating Budget has record-level funding of $22 million from revenue dedicated to preserving agricultural land.

The opioid epidemic is a national crisis and Harford County has done a satisfactory job in trying to combat the crisis.",

Establishing a relationship with members of a community or a particular neighborhood is essential for the purpose of preserving the peace and creating trust between officers and residents.   Recruiting and hiring law enforcement officers that live in the communities they police as well as sharing similar backgrounds and experiences increases the opportunities for successful partnerships and relationships.",
