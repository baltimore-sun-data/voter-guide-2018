While well-intentioned, I do not believe the county's outsourcing efforts have actually realized the cost savings that were anticipated.   As prescribed by the charter, there needs to be a check and balance system between the legislative and executive branch.  The council has relinquished some of the needed authority to accomplish this.  Credit and blame are due both branches for accomplishments and failures. We, the citizens of the county achieve a better \"end product\" when the county government works as the charter called for.",

Future needs will require more manpower and funding as our population grows and needs increase and change.  Our drug and crime issues will demand more officers and correctional employees.  School funding will need more money to maintain a safe environment for our children.",

The comprehensive land use plan sets the guidelines for this balance in our vision for the future.  I believe we can do better if we take a more extensive view of how we would like the county to grow and learn from our mistakes of the past. I have seen too many times, what was planned and approved takes on a whole new look upon completion. There were some issues in the past comprehensive review that I was not in agreement with, that were in contrast with the balance between existing communities and ag land usages. I would look forward to discussions of longer range planning and creating an environment here that provides job opportunities and a county that our children and grandchildren might want to continue to live and call \"home\".",

The volunteer service we enjoy has always performed an extraordinary job for Harford County throughout the years and continues to do so.  The expenses associated with any transformation to a more \"professional service\" will be astronomical.   Throughout the discussion and planning phases of this concept, I would have liked more transparency and public involvement. The growth in our county, the lack of available time people have for education and to volunteer for fire and emergency medical service are no doubt factors that make us look at options.  Transitioning will not be easy and it will become evident very quickly how much Harford County has been blessed over the years to have enjoyed the excellent volunteer service of our citizens who have provided these services for us all.
