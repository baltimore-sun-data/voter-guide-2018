How do you rate the county’s effort and what should have or could have done differently in this controversial transformation?",
      "answer": "This is process which should have been started many years ago.  Harford County's population has grown and how people live and work have changed.  Many times calls may be delayed or unanswered out of certain stations during the day because of staffing issues at the fire houses.  The County needs to involve the volunteer organizations in this process and work out mutually beneficial agreements.  Most counties within the Baltimore and Washington, DC areas have a dual system which work well together to meet the needs of their citizens.",
