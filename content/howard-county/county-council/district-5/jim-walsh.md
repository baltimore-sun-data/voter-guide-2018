In addition, we should use best available technology practices, including reinforced glass and doors, communications systems, alarms, security cameras that can be monitored by police (both remotely and on-site), and other features designed to stop an attacker in their tracks.  I have proposed setting up a charitable foundation to which tax-deductible contributions (not subject to the recently added cap on state and local taxes) could be made to fund these improvements.  The estimated cost for installing this program in every Howard County school would be approximately $40 million.  My proposal could be fully implemented with an average contribution of $80 per year for five years by each household in Howard County.",
  "a3": "Much of our public transit system is under-utilized, and our public transit system cannot efficiently serve residents who live off the beaten path or in more rural areas.  The County should explore using private contractors to fill these gaps in a cost-effective manner.",

I supported the recent revisions to the Adequate Public Facilities Ordinance for the most part, although this amendment as well as some other provisions should be re-visited by the next Council.",

Moreover, some of the beneficiaries of such sanctuary legislation are involved in trans-national gang activity and human trafficking, and prey primarily on otherwise law-abiding undocumented immigrants.  I fail to see the public policy reason for protecting such criminals.  None of the advocates of the sanctuary legislation proposed in 2017 could cite any problems with how the County was treating undocumented immigrants.",

  "a7": "As an emergency first step, all first responders should be equipped with naxalone (i.e., Narcan or Evzio).  Only one hospital is located in Howard County, but Howard County residents are also served by at least six other nearby hospitals outside the County.  It would be better for the experts in the health care field to evaluate the need for an in-patient drug treatment center rather than just starting throwing money at a problem so that we can feel better about \"doing something\".",
