  "a2": "Our schools must be safe learning environments. Each school should have a police officer or sheriff's deputy assigned to them every day. The world is changing and with it security concerns, I do not feel pat-downs or clear backpack are necessary at this point. I do believe, however, that metal detectors can diminish the risks of school threats.

  "a7": "I would meet with our heath care providers and encourage them to more responsibly regulate the opioids that they prescribe. I whole-heartedly approve of in-patient drug treatment centers, but feel that it is treating a symptom rather than solving the problem. A major problem in the opioid epidemic is the abundance of medication. If lower doses are prescribed to begin treatment and physical therapy was used to help alleviate the cause of the pain then the quantity of opioids available will be diminished.",
  "a8": "I am a huge proponent of public transportation projects and do not feel we have invested enough at this point.
