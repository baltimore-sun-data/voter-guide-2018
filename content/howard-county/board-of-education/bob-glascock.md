Based on the results, each school needs to be provided the necessary resources to keep students and staff safe. I support the placement of Community Resource Officers in all high schools and middle schools as needed. Additional security measures need to be implemented according to schools' specific needs.",
  "a2": "Given projected population growth , Howard County Public School System's program to reduce overcrowding through redistricting is an effective method. Another method to address overcrowding includes modifying the system's open enrollment policy to allow students the option to transfer from over crowed schools to schools with available seats. However, this method will not fully reduce the number of students in crowed schools.",
  "a3": "Given the budget deficit and increasing student enrollment, Superintendent Martirano had to make very difficult decisions. Ensuring safe and nurturing schools is a top priority for the school system and community. I strongly advocate for increasing mental health resources to support students emotional well-being.",
  "a4": "The school system's health fund was not fully funded for the operating budget for several years. The HCPSS should examine all possible ways to stabilize the health fund and provide employees with quality health plans. A task force should be created to bring together members of the community, county government, businesses, and non-profit organizations with school system staff and employee associations to study the problem and generate a short and long term plan to address employee health care.",
  "a5": "As a former Assistant Superintendent, I coordinated the development of The Comprehensive Plan for Accelerated School Improvement (CPASI) as a district and school reform initiative designed to accelerate achievement for all students and provide intense focus and support for the schools with the largest student achievement gaps in the district. The CPASI aligned processes and priorities throughout the school system and established clear expectations for all schools. Organizationally, I created the Department of Student, Family, and Community Services to coordinate development and implementation of academic intervention and student services, design and implement a model for family and community outreach in all schools linked to school improvement efforts, and align and integrate delivery systems for student, family, and community support services. To provide schools with instructional resources, I coordinated the development of a K-12 Academic Intervention Plan designed to accelerate student learning. The intervention plan was adopted and funded by the Board of Education. Student achievement gaps were reduced. Within two years, all of the schools in-improvement exited school improvement status as defined by the Maryland State Department of Education. Successful reduction achievement gaps requires a willingness to examine instructional, organizational, professional development, and operational practices for inefficiencies and willingness to engage in honest and open discussion about how to improve them. It requires involvement of school-based staff, central office staff, and parents, families and the community. The key is that everyone accepts responsibility for eliminating the achievement gaps. I feel we need to reignite our commitment to accelerating student achievement.",
  "a6": "In order to avoid protracted litigation, I think the school board acted appropriately. To respond to community concerns about the school system leadership, the school board needed to hire an interim superintendent to to begin to positively turnaround the school system.",
  "a7": "I feel that Dr. Martirano has effectively responded to community needs and began to build trust with the school system parents, families, and school system staff. I support his reorganization in creating community superintendents who are responsible for a cluster of elementary, middle, and high schools. The restructuring provides parents, families, and community members with greater access to senior school system leadership.",
