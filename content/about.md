This 2018 voter guide includes responses to surveys conducted by the Baltimore Sun Editorial Board. We asked candidates to tell us about themselves, list their qualifications for office and respond to policy questions. Their answers are in their own words. The editorial board will conduct additional interviews and research before making endorsements in a selection of contested races.
