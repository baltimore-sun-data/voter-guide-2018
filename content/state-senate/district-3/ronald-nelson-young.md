  "a2": "Yes but we need seperate streams of funding so they aren't always competing. No we do not presently have the funding to adequately meet ou transportation needs. Baltimore is not adequately served. I feel an above ground system woud be more economical, coud be achieved much faster and wouldbetter serve Baltimore. The old trolley routes would cover the city well.",

Baltimore used to be the economic engine of Md. We need to support efforts to bring it back to self sufficiency at a minimum.",
  "a7": "Md.'s business climate is not as bad as has been portrayed.  We need to promote not denegrate our business climate. Review and elimination of duplicative regulations should continue. An educated workforce is one of ourgreatest attributes. We need to strengthen our efforts to bring that attribute to the minority communities and we need to partner our efforts with the bussiness community.",
  "a8": "Yes, but it should be done Nation wide. Hopefully in reviewing the cases before it the Supreme Court will do that. MD is not an Island. When we give up seats and other states don't it weakens our National position.",
