I have also served in elected positions since 2014. More importantly, I have a working relationship with the current Maryland State Senator, C. Anthony Muse, and have actively engaged with him regarding legislation impacting the 26th District and Maryland. As a result, he has endorsed me for the Maryland State Senate seat, which he will be vacating. Finally, I was accepted in the 2018 Emerge Maryland class, which will further prepare me as a woman running for a Democratic office.",
