      "question": "Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education? Are you committed to funding associated reforms, and if so, how?",
      "answer": "The Kirwan Commission produced a report that is an excellent guide to begin the process of improving our state education system. We need to pay our teachers, and we need to address the education gap in Maryland. We can start by ensuring that casino revenue be set aside in a special fund for education and fulfill the promise to voters.  I intend to help get the referendum passed in November; we need to send a message from the ballot box to our elected officials that education is our priority.  We need to continue to build awareness about it and make sure people vote on it in November.",

      "question": "Is Maryland’s transportation spending appropriately balanced between roads and transit? Does the state have the resources to meet its transportation needs? With the cancellation of the Red Line and the advent of BaltimoreLink, is the Baltimore region adequately served by transit?",
      "answer": "Maryland's transportation system is not adequately serving the needs of our growing communities. We need to improve our transit system to ensure that more Marylanders have access to efficient public transportation.

      "question": "Do you support the legalization of recreational marijuana?",
      "answer": "64% of Maryland voters support legalization. It's time to listen to the people. I supported the bill in the 2018 legislative session to put legalization on the ballot as a referendum, because many legislators no longer truly represent the people, so it's time for the people to speak on the issue directly and be heard.  And in states with legal marijuana, opioid overdoses are reduced by 25%.",

      "question": "What steps should Maryland take to ensure the broadest possible access to affordable health care?",
      "answer": "I support the development of a universal healthcare system for Marylanders. We can look at a system that we are already paying into as part of the solution. Tricare is the military healthcare system; most of our taxes go to  I believe that we as citizens should have the right to receive TriCare at cost from the Federal Government. The TriCare system is already prepared to provide care for all ages and genders, and I believe we have the right to access that care.",

      "question": "What role should the state play in helping Baltimore address violent crime?",
      "answer": "The best way to fighting crime is a multifaceted approach.  By giving people who have no good opportunities a lawful way to survive, would be most effective in the long term.  Revitalizing Baltimore manufacturing centers would provide good paying jobs.  \"Banning the Box\"  to allow felons who have paid their debts to society to get a job and not return to an unlawful lifestyle out of need.  Youth outreach would be key, the State should increase funding for community centers, after school, and summer programs to give the youth of Baltimore a safe place to go away from the gangs, and be given the tools and values they need to live in society.   Gang outreach would need to be increased to try and get young men and women out of the gangs for good and become productive members of society.",

      "question": "Does the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights adequately balance protections for police and the public? Should it be changed, and if so, how?",
      "answer": "Law enforcement officers should be afforded the same protections as all citizens -- officers are NOT above the law. And our criminal justice system must be completely changed and dramatically simplified. We need to have more public visibility to what happens within our justice system. We can begin by including ordinary citizens in the disciplinary hearings.  Too frequently police are called to respond to non-criminal situations and the results can be tragic.  We are incarcerating disproportionate numbers of minorities and the current standards and systems we use including the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights may be contributing significantly to the current criminal justice crisis.",

      "question": "What strategy would you adopt to address the opioid addiction and overdose crisis?",
      "answer": "We have to look at the root causes of addiction, which leads to a multi-pronged strategy: addressing the overprescribing of opioids, increase funding for beds, and finally, we need to practice empathy with logic. The opposite of addiction isn't sobriety; it's connection. I propose that we emulate military organizational structures like the Fleet and Family Support Center, which offers an abundance of services for military members and their families, including every kind of counseling.

      "answer": "Developing educational systems that support workers that deliver value to our economy.  We need to develop more programs for addressing families in transition.  Too often a medical, legal or criminal event can leave a family unbalanced. We need to build back connection in our communities.    We need to implement technical training programs that teach small business innovation through agile industry-based partnerships. Through these programs we can build sustainable communities that are innovative, resilient, and ecologically sound.",

      "answer": "Not really, if a developer can get as many waivers for meetings as they need from the local governments.  The open meeting law allows for \"administrative\" but the term is left intentionally vague.  Could issuing a waiver for a developer be considered an administrative function?  As such, is a public hearing needed?  Also, how could the public to even know what goes on in these meetings the written minutes are sealed then can be legally destroyed in 5 years.",
