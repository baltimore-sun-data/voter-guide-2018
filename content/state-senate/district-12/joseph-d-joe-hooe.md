  "a1": "For decades, I have been an advocate for higher teacher salaries, additional spending on schools and school construction, the reimplementation of vo-tech programs across Maryland, and improved student safety, however these improvements require tremendous amounts of money. I have proposed an Immigrant Pay to Work program whereby all 350,000 undocumented workers in Maryland would be required to purchase an annual temporary right to work for $1000 and their employers would be required to purchase an annual blanket hiring permit. My plan will raise $350 million per year in permit sales alone, and millions more after income taxes. We should not have to unfairly bear the full burden of education costs, but we should allow undocumented workers who are willing to undergo a background check, provide a physical address and pay taxes to lawfully enter the workforce. Everyone should be paying their fair share when it comes to education, because nothing is more important than our kids.",
  "a10": "I propose more treatment and less punishment for users, and tough mandatory sentencing for drug dealers. \"If you offer illegal or regulated drugs for sale, then you go to jail.\" .\" Additionally, we need better mental health services, and we need to invest in occupational training for recovering addicts.",
  "a11": "For starters the state can stop using private contractors and temporary workers to fill state positions. If we need people in government, then let's hire them. Additionally, there should be limits on the amount of time that an employee must work in an entry level position, except in industries such as agriculture. And, we must pass laws that ensure fair compensation for everyone.",
  "a12": "I believe that our current \"PIA\" gives the public adequate and timely access to records of all 3 branches, however we should consistently work toward greater transparency.",
  "a2": "The entire Baltimore region is in desperate need of transportation improvements. Let's improve our roads, safety laws and services with particular focus on: The elderly, Americans with disabilities and minorities. Transportation is a form of freedom and we should all have access to that freedom. As for financing improvements, we need to work toward additional revenue generation such as my immigrant pay to work program. We know what our needs are, and we know what needs to be done to address our failing roads, bridges and transit systems.",
  "a3": "I do not have a particular problem with adults who choose to privately use Marijuana, but I am concerned with public use of \"pot\" including use while operating vehicles or equipment, and I have concerns about minor children who may be exposed to the drug while in the sanctity of their own homes. In my opinion, we should be promoting a drug free culture, we should be investing in education and promoting financial independence. I do, however, respect individual rights and freedoms and am commited to finding solutions to these problems.",
  "a4": "We need to work toward compliance with the clean air act standards, it is simply unacceptable that Maryland is deemed a non-attainment zone. As a state senator, I will rewrite comar to address deficiencies in our transportation safety law as it applies to the environment, and I will work to find common sense solutions to protecting our most precious natural resource, the Chesapeake Bay.",
  "a5": "Any meaningful solution to healthcare must include involvement from all of the stake holders which are; the doctors, the nurses, the insurance companies and the patients. We need complete, affordable, one stop coverage and care. We need to cut out corruption and abuses, and we need to put quality and affordability first.",
  "a6": "The state can provide Baltimore with the additional financial resources needed to hire more police and probation officers. Currently, the Baltimore police department is under staffed and overwhelmed. We need to improve police morale, and we need tougher sentences for violent adult offenders. We need to show compassion for youth violators, and our stake holders need to know that they are appreciated. Let's put partisan politics aside and invest in doing the right thing.",
  "a7": "The Maryland economy has tremendous potential, but we are suffering from a shortage of skilled labor. We need to reintroduced vocational programs at the high school level and we need to develop incentives for small businesses to hire. Additionally, I believe it is time for us to tax internet sales, it's not fair to force Maryland brick and mortar companies to compete against online companies that can sell products tax free.",
  "a8": "Gerrymandering is, in my opinion, one of the most offensive practices in politics and all voters should be incensed at the mere mention of the word. Unfair redistricting has kept numerous highly qualified public servants from getting into office and improving the problems we all face, while it has allowed many unproductive politicians to stay in office and exploit their positions of power. I fully support the creation of a non-partisan body to create fair legislative and congressional districts.",
  "a9": "I believe that the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights is adequate, and that recent changes have been made in the best interest of the public. As citizens we have every right to expect the highest level of professionalism from our police, and they deserve our respect and appreciation.",

  "background": "I am the president and founder of The Tire Network, Inc. Since 1998, The Tire Network has become an integral part of the revitalized section of Federal Hill where it is located, providing residents with a local small business that they can be proud of. I am a certified Maryland State Inspector and past volunteer fire fighter. I have advised various commissions and consultants on how to maximize transportation efficiency and ensure that the vehicles on our roads are safe, reliable and environmentally friendly. I am a defender of small business and in 2012, I took on the Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company for trademark infringement and won. I have acted as a political liaison –aid for the Finnish Foreign Affairs Committee, and as a past trustee of the Lansdowne Improvement Association, I worked hard to defeat the Maglev train proposal that would have torn apart neighborhoods in the train's path, and as chair of the CSX Abandoned Utility Pole Committee, I fought against sagging abandoned utility poles, scoring a major victory against CSX Transportation.",
