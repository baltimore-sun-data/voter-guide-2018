      "question": "Is Maryland’s transportation spending appropriately balanced between roads and transit? Does the state have the resources to meet its transportation needs? With the cancellation of the Red Line and the advent of BaltimoreLink, is the Baltimore region adequately served by transit?",
      "answer": "From years of underfunding and/or neglect the needs of our infrastructure needs to be addressed immediately.  Improvement to aging roads and bridges is paramount and our outdated mass transit is woefully inadequate for the needs of the citizens in Maryland, Pennsylvania and Virginia that commute everyday  into business regions throughout Maryland.  The state must  make a commitment to make transportation a priority.  The Baltimore region is inadequately served by public transportation. The gaps that still exist with the cancellation of the Red Line and the attempt of the Baltimore Link to update an antiquated mass transit system has missed it mark for those who live in the outlying areas.",

      "question": "What role should the state play in helping Baltimore address violent crime?",
      "answer": "Maryland needs Baltimore to be strong, but what policy makers are currently doing in Baltimore isn't working. For generations, we have continued to ignore the fundamental problem, those born in Baltimore seem to have fewer opportunities than those born elsewhere. Baltimore spends more than $17,000 annually per student on education and yet outcomes do not equal that level of investment. We need to help our kids by reforming our education system and expanding trade and technical skill training beginning when children are young.  Improving the quality of life of the city's residents will aid in the reduction of violent crimes.",
