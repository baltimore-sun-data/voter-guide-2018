      "question": "Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education? Are you committed to funding associated reforms, and if so, how?",
      "answer": "I support the five findings from the commission.   Preschool should be available to all at a discounted rate. At-risk students should receive the help they need to help them succeed. Teachers should be compensated at a higher rate. High school diplomas should help prepare students better for college. Lastly, the public needs to be given the confidence that funding is making a difference in education.",

With the cancellation of the Red Line and the advent of BaltimoreLink, is the Baltimore region adequately served by transit?",

      "question": "What steps should Maryland take to ensure the broadest possible access to affordable health care?",

    {
      "question": "What role should the state play in helping Baltimore address violent crime?",

      "question": "How would you characterize Maryland’s business climate? What can the state do to foster the creation of more family-supporting jobs?",

      "question": "Does the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights adequately balance protections for police and the public? Should it be changed, and if so, how?",
      "answer": "Law enforcement officers need to be respected by our communities. The officers must hold themselves at a high standard and be a true public servant. I would have to do more research to see how it balances protections and if it needs revision.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What strategy would you adopt to address the opioid addiction and overdose crisis?",
      "answer": "I am very well versed in this topic. As a Paramedic, I see and treat people dealing with this crisis. My thoughts for improving this crisis is to provide more back end support. There are a lot of people that want help. There are only so many beds and places that they can be offered treatment. We need to provide funding to create additional treatment facilities to help.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What if anything should the state do to address income inequality?",
