      "answer": "It would depend on the studies and the findings.   As someone who just exited the Maryland Education system and is unfamiliar with the Committee, I would have to do some research into their activities. I would happily fund reforms that I believe would be best suited for our current education system using my fresh experience.",

      "question": "Is Maryland’s transportation spending appropriately balanced between roads and transit? Does the state have the resources to meet its transportation needs? With the cancellation of the Red Line and the advent of BaltimoreLink, is the Baltimore region adequately served by transit?",
      "answer": "On the state level, I believe that our spending is not balanced for both roads and transit. The state definitely has the budget to support both, it's just a matter of balancing the budget to allow more resourced to be allocated to our roads and transit.  In regards to Baltimore related issues, I'm unable to comment on anything as the city is outside of my district and I don't know the details.",
      "shortname": "Transportation"
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you support the legalization of recreational marijuana?",
      "answer": "Yes. I view this as a generation vs generation issue and not a party vs party issue.  I personally view marijuana in the same light as tobacco and alcohol when it comes to legalization. We can tax it, make jobs from it and save money in law enforcement. There's also the health concern to be noted. If we legalize marijuana, we'll know where it's grown and what is put into it.",
      "shortname": "Marijuana"
    },
    {
      "question": "At a time when the federal government’s commitment to Chesapeake Bay restoration is questionable, what new steps should Maryland take to protect this resource?",
      "answer": "Water quality in the Chesapeake Bay is my biggest concern on this topic. I would definitely push for legislation to improve our water quality and clarity.",
      "shortname": "Chesapeake Bay"
    },
    {
      "question": "What steps should Maryland take to ensure the broadest possible access to affordable health care?",
      "answer": "I believe that our state should try and have a competitive market for health insurance to naturally drive prices down.",
      "shortname": "Health Care"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role should the state play in helping Baltimore address violent crime?",
      "answer": "I don't live in Baltimore or travel there often, but I definitely think the best role the state can play in improving the crime situation is to improve the job opportunities for city residents. If we can increase productivity and improve the job market in Baltimore, crime should decrease substantially.",
      "shortname": "Crime"
    },
    {
      "question": "How would you characterize Maryland’s business climate? What can the state do to foster the creation of more family-supporting jobs?",
      "answer": "I haven't viewed the statistics recently, but from the perspective of someone driving around and observing the area I would say that it's in a slump (at least in my district). I believe that lowering taxes would be beneficial to small businesses as the cost of land and living in our state is rather expensive.",
      "shortname": "Business Climate"
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you support the creation of a non-partisan, independent body to draw legislative and congressional district maps after each census?",
      "answer": "I need to do more research on the issue, but I am aware that there is a lot of discussion and debate on the subject.",
      "shortname": "Redistricting"

      "question": "Does the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights adequately balance protections for police and the public? Should it be changed, and if so, how?",

    },
    {
      "question": "What strategy would you adopt to address the opioid addiction and overdose crisis?",
      "answer": "I would definitely support legislation to fine medical professions who over prescribe a drug that is known the be addictive. It definitely falls in the category of malpractice in my opinion.",
      "shortname": "Opioids"
    },
    {
      "question": "What if anything should the state do to address income inequality?",
      "answer": "I do believe the minimum wage could use a bump, but I would like to consider other methods as well to improve income for lower-income residents.   I have been discussing a few ideas and maybe a commission style system where x percent of a location's profit is split among employees based on position and work time would be a reasonable proposal. Something like this would definitely boost worker productivity.",
      "shortname": "Income inequality"
    },
    {
      "question": "Do the state’s Public Information Act and open meetings laws adequately ensure Marylanders’ ability to exercise oversight of the government?",
      "answer": "I'm not adequately informed enough to provide a response. I will definitely do some research on the issue.",
