      "question": "How do you assess the Trump administration so far?",
      "answer": "The Trump administration continues to fail the test of leadership, effective policy and managing the growth and prosperity for the entire nation. Withdrawing from the Paris agreement demonstrates that he lacks vision and an operating understanding of the basics of climate change. Continuing to push for a travel ban a lack in US fundamental history and the essential value the national has placed on its on strong and extensive immigrant heritage. The obsession with the Wall a xenophobic personal flaw only matched by an inability to learn from the facts and an obsession of repealing the Affordable Care act that can only be characterized as both ill-informed and committed to staying that way.  The Trump administration shortfalls with the LGBT community are tragic and clearly express a world view shared by increasingly less within the nation and world.",

      "question": "Is the level of economic inequality in the United States a problem, and if so, what should the federal government do to address it?",
      "answer": "The level of economic inequality in the United States is a tragic problem. Labor grow has not improved with the growth of profits. This is a reality. Americans are doing a lot more work, producing a lot more output and giving their companies a great ability to resell the products and services they create. Essentially, you are working harder and doing more every year, your company is utilizing that labor to increasingly turn a profit, but they are not compensating the workforce for this increase in productivity! Compensation is not keeping up with productivity. If you are wealthy, you have mastered the process of acquiring and keeping capital.

      "question": "What role should the federal government play in helping cities like Baltimore?",
      "answer": "The cost of living continues to challenge Baltimoreans and the impacts to these costs like water, and utilities are squarely in federal government's ability to support state wide changes.

We need to look at our immigration policy in the perspective (1) as the foundation that built this nation (2) our enduring legacy of inclusion and multiculturalism. I would build on that foundation with a strong focus on national security. We need to support a path to citizenship and improve the processed of naturalization.",

It must be clearly established any other path jeopardizes their survival. This would need to be supported with five-party talks and ensure extensive pressure is made with China and Russia to cease the support they have provided to North Korea.",
