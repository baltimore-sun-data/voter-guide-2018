      "question": "Should the county develop small area plans as part of the upcoming General Development Plan and Comprehensive rezoning process?",
      "answer": "I am a strong proponent of completing and/or updating the 16 Anne Arundel County small area plans as part of the 2019 General Development Plan. The small area plans for many of the 16 areas were last updated 14-18 years ago and in the areas that have seen significant growth (such as Crofton, Odenton, Pasadena, Severna Park, and Edgewater), those plans are outdated. The General Development Plan is a blueprint that should be strictly followed during the comprehensive rezoning process. Waiting to update the small area plans for the next General Development Plan in 2027 is unconscionable.",

    {
      "question": "The Teachers Association of Anne Arundel County continues to advocate for a return of step increases given up during the 2008 recession. Should the County Council fund these increases?",
      "answer": "The teachers of Anne Arundel County took quite a hit since the 2008 recession and were asked to sacrifice quite a bit. If elected, I would like to see before me a plan to restore at least part of the step increases missed to those teachers that were employed with AACPS during those years. We, as a Council, would have to keep it within the scope of what the County could afford without increasing deficit spending.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Do you support maximizing revenue under the county tax cap, or seeking additional revenues to support increased spending on education, public safety or other initiatives?",
      "answer": "I fully support the voter-imposed county tax cap and understand the fluctuation of the rate in surplus and deficit years. I would look for ways to increase revenues that do not include raising taxes and/or fees to support increased spending on education and public safety. Public safety is an area of particular concern to me as we continually ask our police and fire fighters to do the workload of one and a half to two people, thus putting their lives and the lives of those they serve at risk.",
