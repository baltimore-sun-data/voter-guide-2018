    {
      "question": "How do you assess the Trump administration so far?",
      "answer": "I would rate President Trump and the Trump administration as \"Excellent\" with a grade of \"A+.\"  In a short time, Trump has accomplished historic  deregulation and fulsome tax reform.  Trump has reignited the American economy to the benefit of both Main Street and Wall Street.   Middle class tax cuts will pay treble benefits by 2019.  Trump has accomplished these matters despite historic opposition by the establishment elites and the entrenched deep state.",

    {
      "question": "Do you support or oppose the federal tax cuts passed in 2017? What effect do you believe they will have on the economy?",
      "answer": "I strongly support the federal tax cuts and overall tax reform measures of 2017.   The tax cuts will allow the free market to boom in coming years.",
      "shortname": "2069 Tax cuts"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the level of national debt a concern? What, if anything, should be done to reduce it or constrain its increase?",
      "answer": "Yes, the national debt is a great concern.    We must cut wasteful spending in every federal department and agency.  We must rethink the vast expanse of national government bureaucracy with a plan to cut redundant agencies.   Most of all, the government must stand back to allow the free market to bring maximum economic growth.",
      "shortname": "National debt"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the level of economic inequality in the United States a problem, and if so, what should the federal government do to address it?",
      "answer": "Help states substantially reduce violent crime particularly in cities such as Baltimore and Hagerstown.     Economic equality begins with safe streets, downtowns,  and neighborhoods.   Law and Order is a civil right as the basis of all economic growth.   Allow the free market to thrive to grow the economic pie.  As John F. Kennedy oft reminded, a rising tide lifts all boats.     To the extent that the federal government should be involved in education, it should promote spending an equal amount for \"gifted education\" and  \"special education\" efforts.",
      "shortname": "Income inequality"
    },
    {
      "question": "Should federal gun laws be changed, and if so, how?",
      "answer": "First, it should be strongly stated that I support the 2nd Amendment.    Improving the efficiency and accuracy of federal background checks is needed.       Again, I strongly support the individual citizen's right to bear arms .  Like all the other provisions of the Bill of Rights, the Second  (2nd)Amendment should be honored and celebrated.",
      "shortname": "Gun laws"
    },
    {
      "question": "What should Congress do with respect to the Affordable Care Act? Should it be strengthened, and if so, how? Should it be scrapped? If so, what if anything should replace it?",
      "answer": "Repeal and replace with provisions such that pre-existing illnesses remain covered.  More generally, substantially reduce the cost of health care.   Allow a free-market in health care and pharmacy sales in all safe, feasible ways.  Eliminate restrictions on insurance sales across state lines.",
      "shortname": "ACA"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role should the federal government play in helping cities like Baltimore?",
      "answer": "Federal prosecutors should root out corruption and indolence by local officials in Baltimore.    Immediately destroy and deport alien criminal gangs like MS-13.  Consider use of the national guard until the city is turned around.  Reframe Law and Order as a civil right.     Tie the continuation of all types of federal aid to a sharp reduction in violent crime.",
      "shortname": "Urban policy"
    },
    {
      "question": "What can Congress do to address the opioid epidemic?",
      "answer": "Build the Southern Border Wall.  Close the Southern Border (and close tunnels and other channels of transport using the latest technologies) to eliminate drug running.   Eliminate all illegal transportation  of Fentanyl and other synthetic opiods.",
      "shortname": "Opioids"
    },
    {
      "question": "What changes if any should Congress make to our immigration and deportation laws and policies?",
      "answer": "Fully fund the complete cost of the Border Wall (and close tunnels using the latest technologies) along the Southern Border.   Immediately destroy and deport alien criminal gangs like MS-13.  Immediately eliminate chain migration and \"diversity lottery\" visa.    Fund resources to crack down on all types of visa overstays.   Substantially reduce legal immigration for a decade and institute assimilation requirements.   Fund technologies (such as biometric) to keep track of every alien visitor or visa holder.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Should the United States continue with the free trade policies it pursued for the last several decades, or should it enact restrictions in an attempt to help domestic industries?",
      "answer": "America has been in a trade war for 20 years but our leaders, who are beholden to global interests, have not been fighting back.   Other nations (allies and foes) have taken advantage of the US in trade for years.   It is time for fair and free trade.  America First.",
      "shortname": "Free trade"
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you support the Iran nuclear deal?",
      "answer": "No, I do not support the Iran deal until additions and supplements are made to insure that the EU nations will renew sanctions if Iran does not comply.    The Obama administration was foolish to give the terrorist-state Iran literally billions in cash.    The deal must put America First.",
      "shortname": "Iran"
    },
    {
      "question": "How should the United States address the rise of North Koreaâ€™s nuclear program?",
