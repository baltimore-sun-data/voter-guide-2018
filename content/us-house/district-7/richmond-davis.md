      "question": "How do you assess the Trump administration so far?",
      "answer": "I approve of the general economic policies, particularly the reduction of job-killing business regulations and tax cuts.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Do you support or oppose the federal tax cuts passed in 2017? What effect do you believe they will have on the economy?",
      "answer": "I support the Federal tax cuts. Not only are they helping the economy but, on principle, they allow most Americans to keep more of the money they earn out of the hands of government bureaucrats.",
      "shortname": "2017 Tax cuts"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the level of national debt a concern? What, if anything, should be done to reduce it or constrain its increase?",
      "answer": "Absolutely! We must avoid following the path of Greece to, essentially, bankruptcy. Responsible leadership requires that entitlement spending rates must be reined in. That particularly means Medicare and Medicaid. But reductions in benefits or increased age for eligibility should be phased in so that current recipients are not affected.",
      "shortname": "National debt"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the level of economic inequality in the United States a problem, and if so, what should the federal government do to address it?",
      "answer": "No. Inequality is a factor of individual economic choices. If baseball owners, for instance, wish to pay millions of dollars a year for a pitcher who works every five days for six months, so be it. That's not the business of government to regulate.",
      "shortname": "Income inequality"
    },
    {
      "question": "Should federal gun laws be changed, and if so, how?",
      "answer": "No. The Second Amendment does not need changing. The focus should be on restricting this access to guns on those who are proven threats to themselves or others. But remember – criminals will find a way to get guns regardless of any laws.",
      "shortname": "Gun laws"
    },
    {
      "question": "What should Congress do with respect to the Affordable Care Act? Should it be strengthened, and if so, how? Should it be scrapped? If so, what if anything should replace it?",
      "answer": "End Obamacare. Substitute expanded health savings accounts and propose competition among insurance companies, for starters.",
      "shortname": "ACA"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role should the federal government play in helping cities like Baltimore?",
      "answer": "None. If appropriate, that is a state responsibility.",
      "shortname": "Urban policy"
    },
    {
      "question": "What can Congress do to address the opioid epidemic?",
      "answer": "Very little. Public education on the dangers makes great sense. But I am a lawyer, not a health expert, so I am not qualified to propose a prescription for a comprehensive solution.",
      "shortname": "Opioids"
    },
    {
      "question": "What changes if any should Congress make to our immigration and deportation laws and policies?",
      "answer": "Enforce current laws. America, as a sovereign nation, has the absolute right to determine who is admitted. America's interest is best served by establishing a priority for skilled and educated applicants over those with mere family connections with current residents.",
      "shortname": "Immigration"
    },
    {
      "question": "Should the United States continue with the free trade policies it pursued for the last several decades, or should it enact restrictions in an attempt to help domestic industries?",
      "answer": "I am a strong proponent of free trade. That contributes to a healthy American economy.",
      "shortname": "Free trade"
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you support the Iran nuclear deal?",
      "answer": "No. It will lead to another rogue nation acquiring the power to annihilate its neighbors – and perhaps beyond.",
      "shortname": "Iran"
    },
    {
      "question": "How should the United States address the rise of North Korea’s nuclear program?",
      "answer": "The United States should be prepared to take military action if aggression by North Korea becomes highly likely. I hope that American policy ultimately results in the overthrow of the Kim regime from within, making U.S. military action unnecessary.",
      "shortname": "North Korea"
