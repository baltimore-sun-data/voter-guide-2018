      "question": "How do you assess the Trump administration so far?",
      "answer": "President Trump has done a great job in bringing the economy back from near collapse by reducing taxes for USA Businesses small & large, allowing them to compete with China. And lower taxes for regular workers like myself, which is tax cut for everyone except the rich, 95% , despite Pelosi -Hoyer lying about this, saying $2,000 bonuses are crumbs.  Also his ideas about equal tariff's on China/World equal to their tariffs on USA is great idea to bring the factories back to USA. Also need immigration reform where Illegals & green card holders cannot jump on welfare as 70% are doing, taking welfare benefits from Americans. Trump's biggest mistake was not firing Comey day one and being concerned about fake CNN media and anti Trump Democrat leaders.  Shed take cares executive rights and fire Rosenstein and sessions, to have AG fire Mueller & Company  have worked for Clinton Foundation Slush Fund for years! Clinton's selling 20 % uranium to Russia, payoff $145 million & other Clinton crimes. Hillary, Mueller, Comey, McCabe, Rosenstein, Lynch, Jarrett For Prison!",

      "question": "Do you support or oppose the federal tax cuts passed in 2017? What effect do you believe they will have on the economy?",
      "answer": "I believe in cutting taxes as Grover Norquist book \"End the IRS Before It Ends Us: How to Restore a Low Tax, High Growth, Wealthy America\"  http://a.co/5uVR924, and therefore take the Grover Norquist pledge. I will never vote to increase taxes , only lower taxes is my pledge.   Grover's book explains that tax cuts always improves the economy and puts more money into Govt , provides more taxes collected, because it reduces loopholes and people /businesses pay the taxes more rather than hiding their income.  Higher taxes only help the rich because they use loopholes how to avoid and even move their businesses to China/The World to avoid paying USA taxes.  Trump is trying to eliminate all this and tariffs on China and the world will greatly bring factories and companies back to America to give provide millions of jobs for Americans. Watch in the next couple years as USA Companies/ Factories come back to America and empty closed factories all reopened again  and wages start increasing. This is already happening since the tax cuts but it's going to continue more and more Trump's tax cuts and Trump's tariffs will help MAKE AMERICAN'S RICH AGAIN! Including Blue Collar Average Wage Workers like you & me! My income folks is from being Taxi Driver, so yes I'm regular worker, tired of Rich Elites ruling unfairly, like CLINTON'S/BUSH'S/OBAMA'S/PELOSI/HOYER ELITE$$$ of GOP/ DEMOCRAT LEADERSHIP, NOT common VOTERS, who are deceived by these PROFESSIONAL TRICKSTERS!",

      "question": "Is the level of national debt a concern? What, if anything, should be done to reduce it or constrain its increase?",
      "answer": "Grover's book explains that they national debt is a big problem which can be easily solved by cutting government spending. And my solution for this is cut the military Department of Defense , Pentagon and the intelligence agencies which are way over bloated wasting billions of dollars which adds up to TRILLIONS of $$$.  By cutting the military budget and using our military for defensive purposes only rather than the ungodly evil invasions of Iraq ,Afghanistan, Libya , Syria which as a Christian are EVIL, KILLING MILLIONS of INNOCENT CIVILIANS in these nations.   By cutting the military budget we could then balance the budget and pay off our debt  $ 21 trillion which means America is actually bankrupt but we could solve the problem simply by cutting military budget to have the money to pay the debts owed to China and all the other ones who are our debtors. WE COULD THEN BALANCE THE BUDGET AND REDUCE THE DEBT TO ZERO.  Then, have the money for helping American citizens and first off putting $3 trillion dollars into rebuilding America's infrastructure which is crumbling and also could make sure that the government subsidy programs are financially strong that are able to help those who have such a needs and would have money enough for Middle income & lower income to have free healthcare through Medicare and Medicaid.

      "question": "Is the level of economic inequality in the United States a problem, and if so, what should the federal government do to address it?",
      "answer": "Yes, the system is rigged by the 1% billionaire class and multi-millionaire class to keep raising taxes, because these Elites current tax loopholes in there and also they simply can move their factories companies to China or other nations to pay zero tax. Democrat leaders such as Nancy Pelosi lie acting like they are regular blue collar workers however bank account is reported at $149 million dollars, .. Feinstein who is super rich also Hillary Clinton ,Obama , ... Paid off by multi-billionaire George Soros, also, Joe Biden's son just got a deal from China worth 1.8 billion dollars,  as well as Republican leaders such as Mitch McConnell and John McCain, married to a Billionaire heiress. Give an unfair tax breaks to multi-billionaire Companies like Amazon and Apple and Facebook and Google and Twitter  Solution to inequality is As Trump is trying to do.. Trump tax cuts and Trump tariffs will bring back equality in America to MAKE AMERICAN'S  RICH AGAIN!

      "question": "Should federal gun laws be changed, and if so, how?",
      "answer": "I do support the NRA as I support the Second Amendment for our self defense protect our families and homes, however seems pretty simple that rifle age should be increased to 21 the same as handguns.  Also seems pretty simple to have strong background check, including gun shows, which would require I believe 7 days verification process, to check about the psychology of the person to make sure they do not threaten society.",

      "question": "What should Congress do with respect to the Affordable Care Act? Should it be strengthened, and if so, how? Should it be scrapped? If so, what if anything should replace it?",

Obama and me my classmate, our president, and the fight for your health. As a Dr, her book exposes that Obamacare was financial disaster to destroy the Healthcare System and $$ scam to the insurance and pharmaceutical industry,  http://moormanmedia.com/.   As I mentioned in previous question, we could have free healthcare for low income, middle income ,everyone ...who makes under $1 million a year, ...  Private health for $1 million plus and those who prefer Private Healthcare.  If we would reduce be spending budgets of military Department of Defense Pentagon and the intelligence agencies and cut foreign aid and cut and to illegals and green card holders .",

      "question": "What can Congress do to address the opioid epidemic?",
      "answer": "I want to get into Congress to support HR 1227 ENDING FEDERAL MARIJUANA PROHIBITION ACT, because Marijuana is NOT A DANGEROUS SCHEDULE 1 DRUG, which has been demonized since put into this schedule 1 category , but actually is  a medicine which has proven itself to be cure for so many diseases ,sicknesses, ailments in the HISTORY of MANKIND.   Therefore , I believe Marijuana- Cannabis is the solution to the opioid crisis and Pharmaceutical Drug Crisis, medical field has brainwash the public that every solution can be solved with a pharmaceutical drug which actually is a cycle of sickness, disease , sadly sometimes leading to death. Whereas, Marijuana Cannabis is a cycle of healing and health immunity boosting. Therefore, simple solution is to allow   Doctors and Pharmacists to prescribe Marijuana- Cannabis as a HOMEOPATHIC MEDICINE  ALTERNATIVE to the many dangerous pharmaceutical drugs which often times create more sicknesses and only temporarily solve issues.

      "question": "What changes if any should Congress make to our immigration and deportation laws and policies?",
      "answer": "My solution to DACA/DREAMERS is simple ...NO AMNESTY CITIZENSHIP! NO WELFARE!  So they CANNOT STEAL ELECTIONS for DEMOCRATS!    However, DACA/DREAMERS/ ILLEGALS can have a LIFETIME  GREEN CARD which gives them rights for PERMANENT RESIDENCY /WORK PERMIT , however they're needs to be WELFARE REFORM changes where they CANNOT JUMP ON WELFARE as they are able to do CURRENTLY!    And here's the simple solution to IMMIGRATION REFORM.  We need to STOP ALL IMMIGRATION until after 2020.  We don't need 1 million IMMIGRANTS FLOODING America every year, when we have perhaps 20 + MILLION ILLEGALS, and (850,000-2.5 MILLION) DACA- DREAMERS.   Also , the BORDER WALL is simple ... 2 FENCES (Former Military on Alex Jones show, explained this was easy fix. The 2 FENCES 50 -100 hundred yards apart, which would be a Red Zone Mouse Trap Buffer that Security / Drone Surveillance Cameras would focus on and give a space to easily capture Illegals attempting to Cross USA BORDER, topped with RAZOR BARBED COIL WIRE .   (Pretty simple and very cheap...would  cost $2-3 billion, which would of course include DRONES SURVEILLANCE and all the  CAMERAS; HI-TECH  EQUIPMENT necessary to make sure NO WALL JUMPERS,    IF we're going to allow America to be flooded with 20+ million DACA/ DREAMERS / ILLEGALS to become AMNESTY CITIZENS ???  NO MORE LEGAL IMMIGRATION until 2020!!!   NO MORE CHAIN MIGRATION ! NO MORE IMMIGRANTS ON WELFARE! NO MORE FREE HEALTH CARE! NO FREE EMERGENCY ROOM CARE ! NO FREE MEDICAID-OBAMA CARE !",

      "question": "Should the United States continue with the free trade policies it pursued for the last several decades, or should it enact restrictions in an attempt to help domestic industries?",
      "answer": "Answered this question previously dealing with Trump trade policies.  We need fair trade:  if a China puts a 45% tariff on USA GOODS and we put a 3% tariff on CHINESE goods ... Americans cannot be upset when American factories move to China because I cannot compete where these high tariffs as well as workers being paid $3 or less a day ... And the reason we have $800 billion lost to international trade... This is money that should be circulated inside America not shipped out overseees, this is our money folks! Andy thairath scams are everywhere such as if American cars are ship to Europe then they put 49% Terra and again America puts 3% on European cars ...  NOT FREE /FAIR TRADE, can't compete like this..   If we Americans just imagine doing such deals in your small business or doing any deal with neighbor, pretty soon, you couldn't afford to keep dealing this way... It's the Harvard-Yale Elites that try to confuse us regular American folks with their lies and trickeries, as the old saying goes ...trying to sell us the Brooklyn Bridge?

They explained to me that this money was given at the time when the Iranian people were about to overthrow the dangerous Islamic Republic led by Ayatollah Khomeini and this $ 350 billion dollars is used to fund Muslim Brotherhood terrorism in different Muslim nations giving money to Al-Qaeda; Isis ; and other other dangerous Muslim terrorist organizations.
