      "question": "How do you assess the Trump administration so far?",
      "answer": "Interesting. I believe that the election of President Trump was a wake up call to every American Citizen. For the citizens like me who voted for him, we were sick and tired of business as usual. We knew that something was terribly wrong with our government, but we didn't know. Now we are finding out the mass corruption and government oversight that has occurred under our noses, and because of Trump we get to finally do something about it.   I don't agree with everything, but I do appreciate the fact that the light is beginning to shine through and the citizens are remembering their important role in our constitutional republic.",

      "question": "Do you support or oppose the federal tax cuts passed in 2017? What effect do you believe they will have on the economy?",
      "answer": "Yes. I think they should have gone farther, but we can see the immediate positive impact on our overall economy. I think people who are against the tax cuts don't want us to feel good. We have been so uncomfortable (and many of us flat out broke) that any relief is a good thing. More people are finding better paying jobs, more businesses are hiring, and that is how our system is supposed to work. We the people are to prosper, but this overly bloated government.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Is the level of national debt a concern? What, if anything, should be done to reduce it or constrain its increase?",
      "answer": "Extremely high. We are spending like there is no end in sight.  This is extremely unsustainable, and is a major threat to our government. We can negotiate all we want but when the debt holders come calling they can demolish our economy with a snap of a finger. If we do not address government spending, we are doomed. And perhaps that is what some of these people want to do - make us be in a constant state of dependence and insecurity. We cannot remain a strong nation without addressing our debt.",

    {
      "question": "Is the level of economic inequality in the United States a problem, and if so, what should the federal government do to address it?",
      "answer": "The federal government is the reason why we have such economic inequality in the first place. 50+ yrs ago the federal government began to grow in such an exponential rate that created now three generations of generational poverty. Now it is easier to stay on welfare than it is to find and keep a family sustaining job. And over this exact same time stable families deteriorated, poor education, malnourishment, and mass incarceration proliferated. Companies and factories closed show and the robust economic ladder crumbled.   The Feds should get out of the business of degradation and start encouraging American individualism.",

    {
      "question": "Should federal gun laws be changed, and if so, how?",
      "answer": "There are so many on the books already, if anything I think more law abiding citizens should have the FREEDOM to exercise their 2nd Amendment right to protect themselves and their families. Our founders knew that in order for American citizens to maintain their sovereignty, we had to be able to protect ourselves, especially in the face of a stifling government .   These random acts of violence probably would not occur if there were more self discipline, compassion, and shared responsibility. Many don't like to admit it, but faith and God have been ostracized out of our country right at the same time as society's deterioration. We cannot expect to answer darkness without honoring The Light.",

    {
      "question": "What should Congress do with respect to the Affordable Care Act? Should it be strengthened, and if so, how? Should it be scrapped? If so, what if anything should replace it?",
      "answer": "The ACA destroyed health care through the intense lobby of the health insurance industry and other special interests. We had an opportunity to \"fix\" the problem but Congress accepted the advice of lobbyist and could have cared less about the needs of the citizenry.   Health care should go back to a fair market system including health care coops and small business collaboratives. Wellness, nutrition, and homeopathic solutions should also receive the credit that they are do, especially if we actually care about a healthy nation.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What role should the federal government play in helping cities like Baltimore?",
      "answer": "1) Allow law abiding citizens to exercise their 2nd amendment right to bear arms.  2) Allow for School Choice 3) Support community and faith based initiatives to reunify families and encourage American Individualism and conservative values of Liberty, Personal Responsibility, and continue to support the benefits of Entrepreneurship.",

    {
      "question": "What can Congress do to address the opioid epidemic?",
      "answer": "First acknowledge that we have been suffering under chemical dependency way before this recent epidemic.  And next penalize the drug companies, bad doctors, and pill mills who have created the problem in the first place.  Also, Congress should allow for the medical cannabis industry to grow throughout the country in order to create an effective, natural alternative for pain management. Declassify marijuana from a Schedule 1 drug increase research and uses for the plant.",
      "shortname": "Opioids"
    },
    {
      "question": "What changes if any should Congress make to our immigration and deportation laws and policies?",
      "answer": "We have to fix it. This is a major reason why I'm running again for congress. The Sanctuary that has formed in places like Montgomery, Prince George's, and the City have destroyed public safety, the budget, and yes the school system. Because mass illegal and unfettered migration has been encouraged by these local jurisdictions, the local communities are the ones that suffer the most because our congress has failed to act.   There is no way that illegals should have the ability to shut down the American Congress for their own unlawful gain. Unconstitutional executive orders have encouraged law breaking and encouraged a system of paternalism and abuse of the vulnerable.  Something also must be done with international terrorist organizations like the Salvadorian gangs that have taken over our communities and young people.  Maryland is the 4th largest jurisdiction for human trafficking, and why have our electeds allowed this to happen. They must not really care about the lives and safety of anyone. I fear they want to just score votes to stay in office.",

    {
      "question": "Should the United States continue with the free trade policies it pursued for the last several decades, or should it enact restrictions in an attempt to help domestic industries?",
      "answer": "I believe that we should do more to support local industry. Because of the multinational nature of companies, investors have not had to care about local communities as much as they did in the past. Though I do differ from Free Enterprise purist, I believe that there is such beauty and power from financially stable families and economic prosperity. However, we can encourage more citizens to tap into their God given potential and thrive, I'm all for it.   But as an American congresswoman, I will fight to ensure the prosperity of our citizens first.",
