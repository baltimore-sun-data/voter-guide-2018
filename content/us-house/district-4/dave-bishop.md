    {
      "question": "How do you assess the Trump administration so far?",
      "answer": "If he would stop talking and tweeting he might do much better. As far as his job descriptions: Chief diplomat- failing but improving; abusing the power of commander and chief; Fair as chief legislator since he has passed some policies I approve of; poor chief of state (representing all the people).",
      "shortname": "Trump record"
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you support or oppose the federal tax cuts passed in 2017? What effect do you believe they will have on the economy?",
      "answer": "Oppose. They assume that lower corporate tax will stimulate the economy enough to cover $1.5 trillion in deficit. That is a far too risky assumption to make. We should be cutting taxes at all the lowest levels first then gradually work the tax cuts up the scales.",
      "shortname": "2017 Tax cuts"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the level of national debt a concern? What, if anything, should be done to reduce it or constrain its increase?",
      "answer": "The National debt is killing our future as an economic power. Reduce federal burdens that should be handled at the state and local levels. Stop the Federal Reserve from artificially manipulating our inflation and economy unless there is a serious emergency. Markets fluctuate, we need to adapt and stop putting our children in debt over our mistakes.",
      "shortname": "National debt"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is the level of economic inequality in the United States a problem, and if so, what should the federal government do to address it?",
      "answer": "Yes it's a problem. Stop letting corporations determine all the laws. Allow fair competition in the marketplace so small businesses can compete while also paying employees higher wage rates.",
      "shortname": "Income inequality"
    },
    {
      "question": "Should federal gun laws be changed, and if so, how?",
      "answer": "The NICS needs to be more effectively used to easily identify violent convicts and the mentally ill for ALL firearms sales and distribution. Restrictions on types of weapons and excessories would be irrelevant when responsible gun owners keep positive and secure control of their weapons. That includes proper storage and safe carrying, as intended by the founders.",
      "shortname": "Gun laws"
    },
    {
      "question": "What should Congress do with respect to the Affordable Care Act? Should it be strengthened, and if so, how? Should it be scrapped? If so, what if anything should replace it?",
      "answer": "It cannot be scrapped or repealed until all states have the opportunity to replace it at the state level. There still needs to be some federal guidelines for \"promoting the general welfare\", such as not allowing rejection due to preexisting conditions.",
      "shortname": "ACA"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role should the federal government play in helping cities like Baltimore?",
      "answer": "As little as possible. Maryland is the richest state in the nation per capita. There is no excuse for us not being able to solve our problems with crime and poverty! The federal government should be involved in ensuring justice is served when police and other government authorities encroach on pekple's rights. The federal government might best serve the city by assisting with the best selection of quality of police officer recruits, rather than increasing the quantity.  Additionally, the mayor and governor seem to be working well together to eliminate abandoned and delapitated housing. If the money wasn't sent to federal bureaucracies first, we could better manage it in the city and state.",
      "shortname": "Urban policy"
    },
    {
      "question": "What can Congress do to address the opioid epidemic?",
      "answer": "Stop encouraging the black market with prohibition! End the war on drugs! Shift focus to treatment for addiction and wellness until the states have the ability and resources to handle the problem internally. Punish unauthorized sellers for selling deadly chemicals without full disclosure of the products being sold and increased punishment for transporting substances into the country.",
      "shortname": "Opioids"
    },
    {
      "question": "What changes if any should Congress make to our immigration and deportation laws and policies?",
      "answer": "1. Increase border security (not with a wall, but with manpower and technology). A wall will have no effect on the 11 million undocumented people already here. Many of them came here legally in the first place and simply over stayed. 2. Make it easier for people to come here legally and possibly stay longer for work and school. Encourage those coming over illegally to register, regardless of why they are here. 3. All that considered, we still need to recognize that we have an annual maximum capacity. We don't want too many more people coming in than we have going out annually.",
      "shortname": "Immigration"
    },
    {
      "question": "Should the United States continue with the free trade policies it pursued for the last several decades, or should it enact restrictions in an attempt to help domestic industries?",
      "answer": "If we are operating at a trade deficit regularly, we need policies that rectify that deficit. We should always encourage free trade as much as possible, but we can't keep getting the short end of any trade agreement. I will continue researching international trade under the new tariffs to come up with an effective policy.",
      "shortname": "Free trade"
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you support the Iran nuclear deal?",
      "answer": "I have read part of the deal. It's not great for safety and security because it is too easy for Iran to hide their capabilities.  I support the effort to deescalate any tensions between us and amy other country, but I am strongly against the idea of giving a hostile regime leverage to possibly create nuclear weapons.  Generally, I believe we should reduce our meddling in sovonations affairs as much as possible, but I feel that Iran and North Korea are more of a danger to our allies than other nations.",
      "shortname": "Iran"
    },
    {
      "question": "How should the United States address the rise of North Koreaâ€™s nuclear program?",
      "answer": "If Trump is successful at his upcoming interactions with North Korea, we may not need to worry about it. That would be a blessing. At the moment they seem to be willing to negotiate more openly and effectively.   If that changes we need to be prepared and continue sanctions against China if they allow the North to continue hostile type behavior. We need to gradually reduce our presence in other countries affairs as much as possible without letting the world fall into chaos. We shouldn't be the world police.",
