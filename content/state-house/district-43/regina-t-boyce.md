      "question": "Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education? Are you committed to funding associated reforms, and if so, how?",
      "answer": "Yes, I support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education. Education must start early, universal pre-k, be high quality and equitable for all children.

      "question": "Is Maryland’s transportation spending appropriately balanced between roads and transit? Does the state have the resources to meet its transportation needs? With the cancellation of the Red Line and the advent of BaltimoreLink, is the Baltimore region adequately served by transit?",
      "answer": "No, the spending is not appropriately balanced, and the region is not adequately served by transit, especially if one cannot get to a job that begins at 6am when transit begins running at 6am. There is a disproportionate amount of cars to transit on the roads that decrease the ability of buses to get around. The State has the resources to meet its transportation needs, but doesn't devote the resource to the Baltimore region.",

    {
      "question": "Do you support the legalization of recreational marijuana?",
      "answer": "Yes, I do support the legalization of recreational marijuana but with very defined rules on when and where it can be used due to the discrimination of use among whites and people of color, especially males.",

      "question": "At a time when the federal government’s commitment to Chesapeake Bay restoration is questionable, what new steps should Maryland take to protect this resource?",
      "answer": "Protecting the Chesapeake Bay begins at the local level: reducing trash and sewage in waterways and storm drains, updating age old infrastructures, banning plastics and plastic bags, strictly regulating the disposal of chemicals and toxins in water ways, and increasing recycling, up-cycling and composting opportunities and incentives for the State.",
      "shortname": "Chesapeake Bay"
    },
    {
      "question": "What steps should Maryland take to ensure the broadest possible access to affordable health care?",
      "answer": "To ensure the broadest possible access to affordable health care, Maryland needs a holistic and universal approach which can start with further study of  SB878 and HB1312 (Health insurance - Medicaid Buy-In Task Force), for instance. The state needs universal health care that spends differently, which means moving towards direct medical care and finding the best preventative strategies to increase healthy outcomes.",

    },
    {
      "question": "What role should the state play in helping Baltimore address violent crime?",
      "answer": "The state should be at the forefront to help Baltimore address violent crime.

    },
    {
      "question": "How would you characterize Maryland’s business climate? What can the state do to foster the creation of more family-supporting jobs?",
      "answer": "In the state it is critical that the fight for $15 also include a fight for job training and adult education for low-skilled workers who need the wage the most but who lack the skills necessary to compete for it. The state can provide incentives for on-the-job-training and childcare funding and resources  to foster creation of more family-supporting jobs.",

    },
    {
      "question": "Does the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights adequately balance protections for police and the public? Should it be changed, and if so, how?",
      "answer": "No, the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights does not adequately balance protections for police and the public. Officers are expected to uphold the law, not be above it. Therefore officers should be held accountable in the same way anyone else would be for workplace misconduct and wrong-doing, or for suspected illegal activity.",

      "question": "What strategy would you adopt to address the opioid addiction and overdose crisis?",
      "answer": "Adopted strategies to address the opioid addiction and overdose crisis are to ensure current providers have the safest, most affordable and holistic treatment and resources, operate at the at the nations highest standard and efficiencies for treatment and care; improve legislation around high prescription cost and over prescribing; request a state-created public campaign about the opioid crisis: education to humanize those who suffer.",

    {
      "question": "What if anything should the state do to address income inequality?",
      "answer": "The state should address income inequality by working against and funding the root causes of income inequality: lack of a quality education and technology, encourage a free market, enhance computer and technology use among resources and programs, provide resources/funding for childcare, work on development for mix income housing, and continue the fight for universal health care.",
      "shortname": "Income inequality"
    },
    {
      "question": "Do the state’s Public Information Act and open meetings laws adequately ensure Marylanders’ ability to exercise oversight of the government?",
      "answer": "Yes, I do believe that the meeting laws adequately ensure Marylander's ability to exercise oversight of the government  but the state needs a plan to fast track requested information to ensure public trust and transparency while working to define  \"protecting legitimate governmental interests and the privacy rights of individual citizens\".",
