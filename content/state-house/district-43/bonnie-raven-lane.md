      "question": "At a time when the federal government’s commitment to Chesapeake Bay restoration is questionable, what new steps should Maryland take to protect this resource?",
      "answer": "A Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) is a \"pollution diet\" that identifies the maximum amount of a pollutant a waterway can receive and still meet applicable water quality standards. A TMDL is the sum of wasteload allocations for point sources, load allocations for nonpoint sources, and a margin of safety to account for uncertainty. Point sources include sewage treatment plants, stormwater discharges, industrial discharges, etc. Nonpoint sources include pollutants carried by rainfall runoff from forests, agricultural lands, atmospheric deposition, abandoned land mines, etc.  TMDL = Wasteload Allocation + Load Allocation + Margin of Safety  The Chesapeake Bay TMDL is unique because of the extensive measures EPA and the jurisdictions adopted to ensure accountability for reducing pollution and meeting target progress dates. The TMDL will be implemented using an accountability framework that guides restoration efforts using four elements.  These elements include Watershed Implementation Plans (WIPs), two-year milestones, EPA's tracking and assessment of restoration progress and specific federal actions if jurisdictions do not meet their commitments.  This accountability framework helps demonstrate the reasonable assurance provisions of the Bay TMDL pursuant to both the Clean Water Act and Chesapeake Bay Executive Order 13508. However, the accountability framework is not part of the Bay TMDL itself.",
