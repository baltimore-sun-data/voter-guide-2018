We should fund it through common sense revenue measures such as closing corporate tax loopholes and ensuring, regardless of the outcome of the constitutional amendment, the provision of a lockbox for gaining revenue to put towards public education.",

The educational system also needs to play a major role in this effort, which is why we increased funding for schools to educate students about substance abuse. I also support the implementation of recovery programs at all Maryland public colleges.",
  "a11": "The key to this is high quality public education and higher education. To this end, I introduced legislation this session for free community college tuition for working families. As the son of a single, working class mom, and the first person in my family to attend college, I understand that education is the ticket to income stability in America. We need to do everything we can to support students and families who have the abilities but not the means.",
  "a12": "Yes.",
  "a2": "No, the Baltimore region and the state as  a whole is not adequately served by transit. We need to revive the Red Line and push for completion of the Green Line and Purple Line. Our limited transportation dollars should be focused on these public transit projects.",

  "a4": "We need commit to backfilling any funding cuts at the federal level with state dollars. Additionally, we need to update and strengthen Maryland's Forest Conservation Act, as outlined in legislation proposed last session.",

One to support the individual insurance market through a reinsurance program, and the other to create a prescription drug commission that would advise the General Assembly on how to limit exorbitant drug price increases. However, these measures aren't enough. To truly give all Marylander's the health care they need, we must do more to move towards universal single-payer health care.",
  "a6": "Education is the key to combatting crime. We need to invest in funding full implementation of the Kirwin Commission's recommendations and quickly ramp up to the $400 million goal under the Knott legislation for school construction. The state has invested in Baltimore City school construction in an unprecedented way, and we need to keep that commitment. We also need to continue to address the demand for drug use by pushing rehabilitation and drug diversion programs.",
  "a7": "I think Maryland's business climate is strong. We need to close corporate tax loopholes to help small businesses compete against large, multi-national corporations. I also support increased funding for MedCo and TedCo to help support start ups and small businesses. Finally, fostering not only a first rate public education system, but also a top-tier higher education system will continue to attract businesses and ensure we have the workforce necessary to meet the demands of the 21st century.",
