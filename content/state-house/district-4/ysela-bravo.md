A public education campaign could help remove the stigma of addiction and would encourage more to seek help. We also need to ensure that rehabilitation facilities employ best practices and get results.  I am currently researching the pros and cons of innovative approaches by around the country and seeking input as to which methods work best.",
  "a11": "Maryland residents should earn a liveable wage – pay that provides at least enough income for workers to afford shelter, food and health care.",
  "a12": "The information is there, but many people don't know how to access it. I would consider it part of my job to keep my residents informed and reach out to them. I need to learn from them the most effective way to communicate with them.",
  "a2": "The current plans are not balanced – they focus more on toll roads than mass transit. Governor Hogan would like to roll back the gas tax, but then charge tolls to use the road. I would keep the current tax before I would consider tolls. The Baltimore region like many areas of Maryland is not adequately served by transit.",
  "a3": "Other states that have legalized marijuana have benefitted from the influx of tax revenues and tourism. Legalization allows us to control how marijuana is produced and distributed – and to tax it as we do alcohol and tobacco.   We should also restrict its use in public, and impose penalties for sales to minors.  Let's address the concerns of parents, educators, and public safety experts, and learn from the experience of other states.",
  "a4": "Saving the Bay is vital to Maryland's ecology and economy, and involves cooperation from the upstream community in MD, VA, WV, PA and DC. We especially need to do more to control agricultural and municipal runoff.",
  "a5": "We need to look at expanding Medicaid for all to ensure that more people who need care can get it.  We'll save money in the long run from having to pay for emergency services that would be eliminated with preventative care. Having a populace of insured residents will attract medical professionals – my district currently was given a grade of \"D\" for access to health care due to a shortage of medical professionals and because many health care organizations limit the type of insurance they will accept.",
  "a6": "Baltimore is an important part of Maryland. I will ask Baltimore area elected officials to inform me about how and if the state can help address violent crime.",
  "a7": "Our business climate can be improved. We have so much to bring businesses here – great schools, natural beauty, an innovative and educated populace – but we do need to provide more transit. Family-supporting jobs should translate to parents spending more time at home. We need businesses closer to the small towns we cherish and transportation choices for residents.",

  "a9": "The Cato Institute opined that the LEOBR currently infringes on investigations. I would like to know more, as I believe transparency is imperative.",
