      "question": "Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education? Are you committed to funding associated reforms, and if so, how?",
      "answer": "We have enough funding. The system needs overhauling in terms of discipline, security, curriculum (including vo-tech), and teacher vs administration staffing.",
      "shortname": "Kirwan"
    },
    {
      "question": "Is Maryland’s transportation spending appropriately balanced between roads and transit? Does the state have the resources to meet its transportation needs? With the cancellation of the Red Line and the advent of BaltimoreLink, is the Baltimore region adequately served by transit?",
      "answer": "INFRASTRUCTURE remediation. Governor Hogan has done a good job of addressing infrastructure repair rather than new projects, and we should continue to prioritize and fix old problems first.",

    },

      "question": "At a time when the federal government’s commitment to Chesapeake Bay restoration is questionable, what new steps should Maryland take to protect this resource?",

    },
    {
      "question": "What steps should Maryland take to ensure the broadest possible access to affordable health care?",
      "answer": "Affordable is a very undefined adjective. Access is not the issue. The real issue is better health care begins at conception and a healthy lifestyle.  Education, preventive measures, and medical care with less red tape and less over-regulation will reduce costs across the board.",
      "shortname": "Health Care"
    },
    {
      "question": "What role should the state play in helping Baltimore address violent crime?",
      "answer": "Statistically violent crime increases can be traced to the time when discipline was removed, welfare promoted single parenting, and God and morality were removed from day-to-day schooling. Change those and the results will change.",

    },
    {
      "question": "How would you characterize Maryland’s business climate? What can the state do to foster the creation of more family-supporting jobs?",

      "shortname": "Business Climate"
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you support the creation of a non-partisan, independent body to draw legislative and congressional district maps after each census?",
      "answer": "Totally support non-partisan redistricting. Maryland districting is a total mess. Congressional and State districts should be grouped as concise as possible with natural, logical boundaries. All State Delegate districts should be single with no at-large groups.",
      "shortname": "Redistricting"
    },
    {
      "question": "Does the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights adequately balance protections for police and the public? Should it be changed, and if so, how?",

      "question": "What strategy would you adopt to address the opioid addiction and overdose crisis?",

    },
    {
      "question": "What if anything should the state do to address income inequality?",
      "answer": "Another vague concept. People do not write \"unequal\" pay policies. The market is the proper equalizer of job performance with respect to authority, responsibility, and compensation.",
      "shortname": "Income inequality"
    },
    {
      "question": "Do the state’s Public Information Act and open meetings laws adequately ensure Marylanders’ ability to exercise oversight of the government?",
      "answer": "I do not believe they do. Too much is done behind closed doors under the guise of \"executive session\" or \"personnel policy\" concerns, etc. Such loopholes need closing.",
