The Bill established a pill mill tip line and requires coordination and interpretation of overdose reports.  The workgroup also recommended House Bill 1092 which establishes a behavior health crisis response grant program; House Bill 359 enables first responder's to efficiently report and track specific overdose information so that resources like overdose treatment can be allocated in near real time to respond to particularly potent opioids in a specific area; House Bill 1480 which requires dispensaries of CDS to report any suspicious order of CDS; House Bill 653 which requires health care providers both before prescribing a CDS to discuss why the CDS is being prescribed, and the risk of using it; and House Bill 1452 which requires license providers of controlled dangerous substances to complete two hours of continuing education on dispensing CDS.

The General Assembly continued the Governor's initiative  to address Baltimore's violent crime with the passage of Senate Bill 101 (Crimes of Violence and Drug Treatment) which eliminates parole for second time violent offenders and toughens sentences for anyone convicted of drug trafficking while using an illegal gun.",

House Bill 1022 did not pass when the Democrat majority on the House Rules Committee failed to even discuss the bill or to vote it out of Committee.
