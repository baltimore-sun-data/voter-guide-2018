      "question": "Do you support the legalization of recreational marijuana?",
      "answer": "No. I have seen the devastation of drugs and do not take Marijuana usage lightly. I believe today's drugs are harsher and more powerful. As a result states that have legalized marijuana use age have realized an increase in the cases of those who drive while impaired. I also think that any form of legalization will make drugs more easily accessible to minors.",

      "answer": "More and better paid law enforcement officers.  Create less demand for illegal drugs by increasing  funding for treatment , as well as funding for drug prevention programs. Stiffer sentences for opioid  drug dealers of but also go after the doctors who are writing bogus prescriptions and pill mills. Ultimately, I would suggest suing Big Pharma and making them not only pay for the mess that they have helped to create but also for the aforementioned programs for treatment and drug prevention. Additionally, I would prevent measures aimed at making Md a Sanctuary State, which leads to more undocumented criminals relocating here.",

      "question": "What strategy would you adopt to address the opioid addiction and overdose crisis?",
      "answer": "I support the efforts of local governments as well as states in their legal pursuit of Big Pharma. Much like the tobacco suits of the past - successful - these funds should be directed to not only prevention programs (at a young age) but should also provide more access to treatment for those who suffer from addiction.",

    {
      "question": "What if anything should the state do to address income inequality?",
      "answer": "Income Equality is best dealt with by making Maryland a destination for business. As of now too many job creators are either fleeing the State or not coming here at all. We must reduce regulations, offer incentives to all businesses in the form of tax reductions and not just to the chosen few such as the most recent tax package that was offered to Amazon. Encourage others to do what I did and purchase a failing business and turn it around so that it creates more jobs and tax revenue.
