With the cancellation of the Red Line and the advent of BaltimoreLink, is the Baltimore region adequately served by transit?",

A fresh look at the bill is appropriate in view of events that have unfolded since its inception.",

      "answer": "The opiod crisis requires, at a minimum, on-demand treatment in an inpatient facility. Additionally, medical cannabis shows promise in treating chronic pain without the addictive properties and withdrawal potential. Additionally, opiods, over time, are less effective in treating pain requiring larger and more dangerous doses. Mandatory treatment after the administering of Narcan with follow-up in patient treatment available are the first steps we should take in addressing this crisis.",
