However, before we commit additional funding, we must first make sure the current funding is being spent appropriately.

We need to be more aggressive in prosecuting those who sell fentanyl and have stricter penalties for those sellers, especially if someone dies from an overdose of a drug and we can identify the source.  We need to hold doctors liable as well for overprescribing pain killers and limit the amount of doses that can be prescribed.",

I do believe it is a gateway drug and is used by too many young people who make bad choices when under the influence of marijuana.  It makes people lazy and unmotivated.   However, I do support the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes.",

I support the expansion of Medicaid,  but there are currently only two choices for those who are self-employed.  We need to either limit the amount an insurance company can charge, or we need to allow those who are self-employed to go across state lines to purchase insurance.",
  "a6": "The State should always play a role in addressing violent crime, whether its creating more jobs for young people, making tougher laws, or assisting those who are addicted to drugs. But we need to make better use of our faith community and businesses to come along side the young people to provide them with opportunities and steer them away from the cycle of drugs and violence.",
