      "question": "Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education? Are you committed to funding associated reforms, and if so, how?",
      "answer": "Over the past year the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education (Kirwan Commission) has been studying the research and hearing from experts about the best practices that lead to high educational attainment internationally and here in the United States. Maryland has long claimed to be #1 in Education while ignoring the growing achievement gaps and in-equities in educational opportunity within and among districts and populations of students. The recommendations presented by the Kirwan Commission provide a comprehensive framework with strategies that will move Maryland forward toward college and career readiness, but only if the implementation maintains a strong emphasis on equity.   Investing in early childhood education, strengthening the quality of teachers and school leaders, providing coordinated wrap around services through community schools, and expanding CTE pathways are practical, high impact strategies that will take a major increase in dollars but will reflect the states priority and meet our constitutional requirements. The lock box on the casino dollars was first step in paying for Kirwan. Some of the initiatives may need to phased in while revenue strategies are developed. Moving dollars away from institutional incarceration in favor of more successful and affordable community based rehabilitation strategies can also increase our investment in education while continuing to balance the budget responsibly.",
