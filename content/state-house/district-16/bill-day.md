      "question": "Do you support the findings of the Commission on Innovation and Excellence in Education? Are you committed to funding associated reforms, and if so, how?",
      "answer": "The Commission made some good findings. Education is the great equalizer. We need to ensure that every child is able to learn and achieve their highest potential in an environment that has all of the basic resources students, teachers and administrators need. I understand the importance of education and I greatly benefited from my public school education. My mother was a public school teacher and I have a child enrolled in public schools. I see the struggle for resources today that were not there in years past. From the state level, we must collaborate and strategize with counties to strengthen every school system in our state.",

      "question": "Is Maryland’s transportation spending appropriately balanced between roads and transit? Does the state have the resources to meet its transportation needs? With the cancellation of the Red Line and the advent of BaltimoreLink, is the Baltimore region adequately served by transit?",
      "answer": "D16 residents are employed and attend schools located throughout the region and depend on well maintained local roads, 495 and 270 and Metro system. Of major concern is the capacity of these roads to accommodate traffic that will increase with arrival of new businesses in Bethesda and Rockville I will work with the Hogan Administration to improve traffic congestion.",

      "answer": "The Chesapeake Bay is a source of pride and economic prosperity for Maryland and its watermen. So many Marylanders' livelihood depends on the health of the Chesapeake Bay. My wife's family has made use of its resources for generations by owning and operating the Rod 'n Reel Restaurant on the Chesapeake Bay in Chesapeake Beach, Maryland. I support Gov. Hogan's funding toward wide-ranging Chesapeake Bay restoration efforts, continuing the commitment to protecting Maryland's most precious natural asset.",

      "question": "How would you characterize Maryland’s business climate? What can the state do to foster the creation of more family-supporting jobs?",
      "answer": "The State of Maryland has made great strides under the leadership of Gov. Hogan in improving the business climate of Maryland.

Regulations, infrastructure, transportation, taxes and public education all need to be evaluated to encourage businesses to locate and grow in Maryland.",

    {
      "question": "Does the Law Enforcement Officers Bill of Rights adequately balance protections for police and the public? Should it be changed, and if so, how?",
      "answer": "Law enforcement is a dangerous job. My wife's cousin was shot in the line of duty. Law enforcement, like public officials should be free to perform their jobs without the fear of civil lawsuits. However, no person should be immune, if they violate someone's civil rights. We must ensure that all law enforcement officers receive the necessary education and training to be able to properly respond to situations they encounter on the street.",

      "question": "What strategy would you adopt to address the opioid addiction and overdose crisis?",

I support the Opioid Operational Command Center to coordinate state and local agencies, impose a Prescription Drug Monitoring Program, limit the amount a health care provider can prescribe, and strengthen laws to impose strict penalties on distributors of fentanyl. We must work with medical practitioners, law enforcement and pharmacists to educate the public on the potential for addiction and abuse. We also need to work to end the stigma of addiction so more people will seek help.",
      "shortname": "Opioids"
    },
    {
      "question": "What if anything should the state do to address income inequality?",
      "answer": "If what we care about is inequality of opportunity then we need to stop hampering the ability of Marylanders to get ahead.
